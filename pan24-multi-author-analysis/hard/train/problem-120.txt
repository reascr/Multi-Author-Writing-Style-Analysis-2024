Why do these countries that have horrible things happen to them, end up doing those things to others and acting more like the countries that did the horrible things to them in the first place?
Its like getting raped, being traumatized, writing a book about it, and then deciding you want to become the rapist. Makes no sense.
Yeah. Historians have reviewed the pre-war societies and concluded they were basically haemorrhaging money and manpower hand over fist. Many of their governments were full of infighting, competing and redundant organisations in an attempt to seize more power.
Its theoretically possible. It would require a dictator who was very competent at just about everything though, as in fascism one of the core points is you can't allow anyone else to get to powerful to contest you. Its very difficult to rule any area of any reasonable size without some element of clear power sharing.
They had to invade to steal resources and focus everyone outward, otherwise their society would have pretty much collapsed.
They then need to look externally both for more wealth (they've sucked their country dry) and for an enemy to blame the current state of things on.
