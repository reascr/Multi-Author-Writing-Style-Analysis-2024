Designating a location as "holy" serves to provide the believers with motivation to fight for control of that location. This specific holy land happens to be a major hub for transferring goods & military forces between the mediterranean, the middle east and north Africa, and the more granular holy places such as Jerusalem, Hebron or Safed happen to be situated on tall mountains overlooking some of the major pathways in the region.
You could call that an atheistic point of view, and I'll give you that if you would, but you can't deny how conveniently located these "holy" places are.
And if we assume it God does really exist and that is his holy land, then he must be a bloody god - that was the implication I was making.
My implication wasnt that its so bloody due to religion, my point is that is it a bloody land, so the claim that it is the holiest land of God is what seems disengineous to me. It isnt really holy, its just strategically important, and religion has been used as a tool to convince people to continue fighting perpetually for longer than any other region in the world.
not to the same degree. People have been fighting over that piece od land for much much longer. Also Germany or China arent considered holy land by 3 major world religions.
