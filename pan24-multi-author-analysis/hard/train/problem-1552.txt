Well, if they buy tickets give them a show. I’m tired of these clowns wasting taxpayer money to propose and pass laws we’re all expected to treat as “just a joke bro.”.
If it passes a serious person needs to take it to court to keep every bit of meat eggs and dairy out of the grocery stores to teach these idiots that we vaccinate livestock to stop pandemics that could cause billions of dollars in losses from animal diseases.
Can't wait till this backfires and the bill language will mandate that meats will need to carry the vaccine info used to inoculate the animal and not to introduce into humans.
But no they just try to go against vaccines for PR but didn't actually ban them since they aren't that stupid and know that is a horrible idea given animals need them just like humans.
I think they could've just made a law requiring all drugs used need to be labeled and it's actually a good bill.
Correct me if I'm wrong but this seems to do nothing, wouldn't they just put a label on their food to get around this...which also to be honest is good(definitely not their goal but still) since people should know what goes into their food.
