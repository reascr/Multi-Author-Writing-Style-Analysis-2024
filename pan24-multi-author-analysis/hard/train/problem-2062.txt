Even if we view them as worse then most because they're an exporter of fossil fuels, I think much of the blame continues to fall on the west. The people who buy the fuel and then burn it are also at fault (looking at you Germany).
You hear it all the time in the states "we can't do anything about Climate Change, even if we tried China and Russia would continue emitting.".
My point was simply blaming Russia for climate change because they are a net exporter of fossil fuels kinda diverts attention from the countries that are dependent on Russian fossil fuels like Germany. If Russia stopped exporting fuel to Germany (which it largely has) Germany would continue to be a large greenhouse producer and source its fuel from other places like the Middle East or the United States.
Chinas main source of CO2 emission comes from burning coal ( which they import mainly from Australia, the biggest coal exporter in the world btw ), the U.S. isn’t importing from Russia either, so I do not understand the point you were making about Gas being exported by Russia and your shout out to Germany in particular.
If you looked at the link I posted you would see that China AND the US produce more CO2 than the next 10 highest CO2 contributors combined…..
