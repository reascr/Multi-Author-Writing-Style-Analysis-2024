Actually that's not the whole story. Haaretz reported yesterday. Netanyahu wanted Ukraine to vote against the motion. Zelensky told him that in exchange for a vote in his favor or official abstention, he needed military support for the war. Netanyahu declined to commit military help but told him they could speak about it at a later point and Zelensky gave the order for the UA representative not to show up so that UA keeps the door open if Netanyahu chooses to help in exchange for a favorable vote. In this case Ukraine did not officially abstain either, they did not vote and abstention requires a vote.
Your comment said that they are "abstaining in really helping Ukrainians". What you meant to say was "they are abstaining in certain specific types of aid to avoid creating new geopolitical issues for themselves". You may not care about Israel's security, but they do and they are doing everything they can to help Ukraine without putting themselves at risk.
If Israel is providing any support- and is willing to keep Russia's 1 ally Iran in check, it would be stupid for them to jeopardize that.
If it happened it would be more about paying Israel back for supporting Ukraine if Israel went that route. The whole eye for an eye thing.
Ukraine is doing well because they are mostly using western gear and getting constantly resupplied by NATO countries as needed. Russia on the other hand is having shortages of everything because their defense manufacturing was producing gear at peacetime pre-war levels up until around August this year. Also due to corruption where piles of gear that was being reported in inventory was missing or never existed in the first place.
