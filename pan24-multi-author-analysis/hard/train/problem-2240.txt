Who in the hell, as a politician, can get away with saying they think you shouldn't have citizenship if you think other countries are better? That's some actual 1984 shit, and this ass got close enough to being elected that they have to try again. It's especially egregious considering that if you look at the numbers, there are better counties that do exist, and they are empirically doing a better job. I wouldn't be surprised if he was in favor of pretending those countries don't exist, or making it a crime to point out that other countries do things better.
That's "you better think America is the best or we'll prevent you from even being considered a citizen".
"And I'm saying, and I'm not being tough, I'm saying if you know a place better, you go there but you lose your citizenship here in the United States of America,".

But it's still very revealing that he gave that response, when asked about young people who want to change the country.
This MF saying if you’re aged 32 and under you have no right to try and change America. Coming from a guy who’s probably suffered multiple concussions this seems like logical thinking.
