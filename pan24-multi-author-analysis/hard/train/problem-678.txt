What cross examination? There has been no trial. And more than enough evidence released to the public, who knows what else they have yet to be revealed.
It was extremely well investigated, presented, and thorough. While I’ve seen a ton of “witch hunt” and “political theater” comments, I’ve yet to see a single refute of the fake elector scheme, or defense of his actions in any capacity.
What a weird comment. Trump hasn’t been accused of any specific crime in any official capacity, so that isn’t a thing.
Material that the Jan 6 commission uncovered, such as the Eastman memos, builds a stronger case, but even then much of it doesn't directly implicate Trump.
Iit's not just that he threw in the word "peacefully" once, after spending two solid months whipping his supporters into a frenzy and telling them they need to "fight like hell." It's that a good lawyer (assuming Trump could find one willing to work for him) could easily establish reasonable doubt. "I'll march down to the Capitol with you" could be (the lawyer would argue) about peaceful protest. "Fight like hell" could be a metaphor for a political battle. And of course the clip with the word "peacefully" would be played repeatedly for the jury.
That (plus the two months of inflammatory rhetoric leading up to it) makes it clear to you and me and any honest viewers that he was inciting a riot, but none of that amounts to a winnable court case by itself.
