What they really think is whatever right wing anti democrat propaganda is being fed to them. I know that sounds US centered but that's really what it is. Thailand is becoming more and more anti US especially now that their government is pretty much totally defunct and is military led. The amount of Russian, China, Republican (tucker-esq) propaganda they consume is mind boggling. They absolutely hated Obama because he was black and actually believe that Trump would have supported them...a group that is on welfare more than I can stomach and purposefully takes cash jobs, manipulates their living situation and evade taxes like the plague.
Its global. My wife's Thai friends spout all sorts of anti Ukraine nonsense. "Did you know there's corruption in Ukraine?" Yeah, no shit. There's corruption in your country, my country , every country. That doesn't mean you support Russia...ever. Fuck Russia.
Seems your politicians know it is ok to fuck Russia over when the situation calls for it. Even if they like the money..
