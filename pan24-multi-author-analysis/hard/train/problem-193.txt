Even people that hate their current government will rally under them (temporarily) if a third party attacks them in a manner the citizens consider unjustified.
You aren’t just nuking Khamenei though, those facilities still reside within a country they (ostensibly) consider their own. Having nuclear weapons isn’t an evil act itself, and with Ukraine as an example it’s actually really an unfortunate necessity.
It's shit like this that encourages Iran to develop nuclear weapons Russia has shown that world that if you have nukes, people won't touch you Iran has clearly learnt that lesson and Israel's saber rattling only exonerates Iran in their quest for nukes.
i dislike the iranian govt as much as the next guy, but theres no way the israeli govt gives a damn about iranian civilian casualties compared to the strategic importance of knocking out nuclear sites lol.
I don't agree with a lot of what the Israeli government does, but in terms of keeping your entire country from being destroyed overnight, it's better to be proactive and stop a bomb being built in a lab than it is to enter an all out war or have to suffer an atomic bomb.
On the flip side, if Israel did nothing and got nuked I would definitely blame Israel, they had the intelligence, the resources and the justification.
