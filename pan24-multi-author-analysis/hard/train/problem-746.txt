If the supermajority in the state legislature doesn't get the extremists to vote with them, they won't have enough votes to override Kelly's veto, to my understanding.
There’s a rift in the Alaska legislature, too, where Republicans don’t have supermajorities either. It has handed power there to a coalition of Democrats, Independents, and a handful of pro-coalition Republicans.
Those pro-coalition Republicans didn’t join out of the goodness of their hearts. They joined because it was in their best interests.
But I submit to you that we are in a right now, and during political realignments the old rules suddenly go hang because politicians’ and voters’ incentive structures become rearranged by some event — such as, well, everything that’s happened over the past six years and especially Dobbs — and simply for the purpose of pursuing self interest (if nothing else — I assume politicians are selfish machiavellians and go from there), individual actors find themselves in positions where unusual decisions are clearly and obviously beneficial to them.
