Both Russia and Ukraine are in a population demographic crisis, especially for young people. That's why Russia is kidnapping and deporting tons of people from the cities it occupies. Any Ukrainians who are against immigration may have to rethink this.
In either case, you should read before you talk and see what Russia is doing to the civilians of Ukraine.
Ukrainian torture of russian victims _does_ happen, but it's neither systematic nor state-sanctioned and thus much, much more rare. Meaning the perpetrators are acting on their own and will very likely be put in front of a court later on if found out.
Stop both siding this, there's a world of difference between the two. And, again, nuance is important. I highly recommend having a look at the articles about this topic and not just the headlines, they are awfully reductive and often misleading.
Russian torture of ukrainian victims is both systematic and state-sanctioned. It's part of their war tactics. See all the massive torture rooms and civilist mass graves which have been found so far. Who knows how many more there are still around... Russia has no intentions to punish the perpetrators, instead they are giving them promotions and medals.
