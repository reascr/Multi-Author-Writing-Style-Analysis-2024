The most embarrassing part of it though is people still believed the sexual harassment claims were because he’s a Republican, and it was the slander campaign ramping up.
Later he made a tweet about keeping an eye out for a smear campaign against him now that he's a republican.
The writer of the article contacted musk for comment before any of Musk's political statements here were made.
Also Musk: A poll on Twitter is a perfect way to understand public sentiment, and whether I should reinstate a threat to American democracy.
Musk: Twitter is filled with mostly bots so I shouldn’t have to pay the absurd price I myself suggested.
The only time Twitter has been profitable was 2018 and 2019 when Trump was at his wackiest, but wasn’t getting people killed like in 2020. They made $1.2B and $1.4B respectively in profit.
For those playing along at home, that’s almost enough to service the $1.5B in yearly interest that Musk has to pay on the giant loan he has for the site.
So the financial situation is not great, but could be better so let’s “put it to a public vote” by the guy that has the ability to manipulate said vote and is financially incentivized for the outcome of that vote. It’s definitely not strange that within an hour of putting up the poll that it had 2.5M votes that nearly 70% of those going Trump and as it goes on it’s edging closer to 50:50 with another 10 more million votes in 20 more hours. Doesn’t sound like anyone’s been attacking it with bots early, nope surely not.
