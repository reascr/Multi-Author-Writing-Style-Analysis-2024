For anyone wondering why Switzerland has a say in any of this, it seems that Spain originally purchased these Swiss-made arms - and part of that agreement requires permission prior to being on-sold or donated.
A law that makes sense from a distance, given that no nation would want to see their arms land in the hands of an enemy nation through a 3rd party.. but in this case, the Swiss Gov’t needs to take a break from shielding Russian oligarch funds, pull their finger out from where the Sun don’t shine and get out of the way of other nations trying to help an ally currently under attack.
Switzerland’s neutrality made sense as a self defence mechanism in the early-mid 20th century but now that it’s nestled safely in the middle of the EU it’s not only selfish, it’s immoral.
Reminder that Swiss martial neutrality was because Swiss mercenaries were effective enough that they were being bought up by both sides in wars, so the neutrality was put in place to protect them from killing themselves.
Switzerland has spent its entire history of neutrality playing each side to ensure that neither side thinks the Swiss are taking sides while also profiting from whatever crisis is happening. If they were to send something to Ukraine, then they’d have to send something to Russia too (which they obviously don’t want to do). That’s how neutrality works. If the Russians were the ones being unjustly invaded, they wouldn’t help them either.
Switzerland could abandon its neutrality but they have no reason to. Their country has been built on the idea of neutrality and their entire military and economy revolve around their neutrality. And I doubt the Swiss people would be in favour of it.
