Erdogan is a Machiavellian in the morally neutral kind of way. I think he sees himself as a moral leader in an immoral world, who must play world powers against each-other or else they will play him. And there's a certain truth to that.
Pretty much. Does this make Ergodan "less of a bad person"? Fuck no. Does the fact that he's a jackass mean that this must not be a genuine opinion that he has? Fuck no. Who cares whether it's an actual belief or something he's saying for political clout? It changes nothing about Turkey itself either way.
You would if you know about Turkey. You wouldn't if you don't and your only knowledge is it's a Muslim majority country. I think even if we had good news internationally a lot of people would have the same reaction to this news.
I don't but I also don't expect every single person to have an opinion about everything that ever happened anywhere.
Him being authoritarian have nothing to do with women's rights or other stuff like that but Turkey bad narrative on every topic makes uneducated people in west think this is a hot take.
Turkey is one of the first countries to give women right to vote. There is nothing surprising about what Erdogan said but a lot of people here is surprised.
Erdoğan: “Hey, don’t agree with that! You’re supposed to say, ‘Oh no, handsome, you aren’t a bad person at all’”.
