It means the Saudi prime minister has just learned the phrase "all bets are off" and was trying to use it.
Since the topic of Iran's nuclear weapon predates Windows XP, the Saudi prime minister thought it is safe to use it.
I have a few concerns about Iran becoming nuclear-capable, but the risk to Saudi is not one of them. Not even close.
hardly. Forgot about Turkey? Syria? Pakistan/Afghanistan? (and historically, Turkey was the capital of the old Ottoman empire, and wouldn't mind re-constituting that).
It's going to get absolutely spicy and dicey. The previous order that held this all together for so many decades is beginning to erode.
There's no way in hell they develop their own before all this goes down. Iran will not give up their initiative. Neither will Israel, I'd guess.
Not just the Saudis. Israel would probably preemptively strike. They've learned their lesson over the countless conflicts they've had with their Arab neighbours. Especially with a country that wants their destruction.
