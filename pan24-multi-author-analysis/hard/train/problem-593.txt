Fuck, however will Ukraine stand up against malnourished North Koreans with ancient weapons who don't share a language with the Russian soldiers they're teamed with.
Russia is barely holding its own against Ukraine, and that's only because they are throwing bodies into the meat grinder to soak up enemy fire. They have exactly zero chance of victory if NATO actually puts boots on the ground.
If ANY country (Belarus, North Korea, Hungary, China, Iran) etc sends troops in as support for Russia, that opens the door wide for other countries to do the same on Ukraine's side.
Well, that's the thing. Thus far, the only 'official' countries involved in the war are Ukraine and Russia.
Russia literally cannot afford to have any other nation get involved in this conflict. It is a guaranteed defeat if that happens. They have no choice but to remain the only aggressor nation.
Suddenly, Russia is facing coordinated and massive airstrikes, multiple fronts to defend, and their paltry excuses for 'allies' will not be nearly enough to compensate (especially because it's damn clear that China, despite me listing them in the group above, will NOT get involved).
