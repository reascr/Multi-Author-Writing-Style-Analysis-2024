Young people are risking years of imprisonment if not their lives in the hope of freedom and democracy in Iran and Russia. Democracy is at risk in America too, but millions of people, especially the young, will not bother to vote because Democrats aren't perfect or they don't like the price of gas. This could be the last chance for anyone's vote to actually matter.
5) If you don’t vote, you have no right to complain. (If people were voting for which place to order lunch from, you can’t say “I don’t care,” and then complain when pizza shows up. The same logic applies here, and this is MUCH more important.).
True. Voting for the Dems is not going to fix our problems. Voting Dem is just a way of buying us time to find an actual solution outside of this rigged political dynamic.
If the democrats wanted their votes, they’d start fighting for them instead of pretending they are the problem.
That’s the problem the democrats want to ignore that though. They keep saying the younger generation is “sulking and moping” but that’s because we’ve realized that the democrats are a guaranteed death sentence for us just as much as the republicans, only difference is the republicans want to do it a whole lot faster. Democrats are lock step with capitalism just like the republicans, and just because they don’t plan to use it to destroy democracy, they are going to let to erode democracy until it’s gone.
They can blame the voters all they want, but the fact will always remain that the democrats have allowed the republicans to walk all over them time and again since at least nixon. The only time they change their tune is when they start losing elections and are forced to adopt policy changes.
