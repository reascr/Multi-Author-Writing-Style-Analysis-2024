Motherfucker. Absolutely EVERY ONE knows what the fuck a Devil’s Triangle is. And it’s not a fucking drinking game.
> Clearly a drinking game...with three glasses. Have you ever played Quarters? It's like that, except two guys stick their penises into one woman.
It's complete insanity that this buffoon was elected to the Supreme Court. The US SC is nothing but a joke now, except it can ruin countless lives with their partisan hyper-conservative bullshit.
For all that conservatives whine about Democrat's spending a hundred bucks of their own money on hair cuts, they entirely ignore the batshit insane lenhs and cost that trump goes to.
Someone spent 2 years investigating trumps hair, and it's fascinating and a wild story that involves trump buying out a hair clinic that provides $60,000 a treatment hybrid hairplug-weave, shuttering them to the public, relocating them to the office below his penthouse in Trump Tower, and building a secret back staircase between his home and the clinic so no one would ever see him going there.
