"But voters should be able to tell!" No. Most people aren't paying attention. Or they really see "both sides" doing it. And once Republicans cement a media narrative, Republican lies look like the truth, especially since Democrats splinter and scatter under anything more than a stiff breeze.
The Democratic side has no equivalent to this, not on real issues, and certainly not on invented issues, so people either fall into the conservative narrative (see the ) or just generally stop paying attention.
They're kept terrified of immigrants. Of minorities. Of becoming a minority. Of the gays. Of trans kids. Of "crime". Of Dr. Seuss books. Of any number of things that fuels conservative hysteria.
Also also, most people don't care about government. Their question is "what are you doing to make my life better?", and unless you are constantly hammering that point, as well as that Republicans will harm them, Republican faux-populist talking points will stick, again supported by their media narratives.
The point is Republicans feed into this blaming Mexicans and liberals and socialist for all the problems in the country making it so it becomes savage to debate them.
