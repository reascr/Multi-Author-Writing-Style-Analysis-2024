Atleast a dozen homeless people are found dead in the small town I just moved from every winter. And that’s not even blizzards.
I agree though that blizzards are the least dangerous. Lived in New York and Massachusetts for many years. Never lost power from a blizzard or had major property damage. Just many annoying hours shoveling snow.
Yeah but how early is that? What kind of warning? And how do you know your animal is not just freaking out about something else? I’ve never lived in an earthquake zone so I legitimately don’t know.
I live in a place that gets earthquakes from time to time, but they're always hours away from us and any tremors we get are not able to be felt.
I’ve been in southern CA 33 years and the worst thing an earthquake has ever done to me is get me out of work early once. The only place that scares me during one would be like a Cosco or Home Depot. If you catch on to what’s going on early, they’re honestly pretty fun to ride out. Dogs and cats will usually give you a heads up too.
