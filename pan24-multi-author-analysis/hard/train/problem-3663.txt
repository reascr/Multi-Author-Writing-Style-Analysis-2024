Not a side step. A legit criticism of the prior comment. I don’t think 3D printing is any harder that working material by hand. Working material by hand requires a fair about of skill. That skill is native to many of us. Computer skills required for 3D printing are native skills to younger generations while hand tool work is not native to them.
While 3D printing isn't terribly insurmountable, it is still a way, way higher bar than a hand drill and some files. In the case of a Glock, you still need to purchase or fabricate the metal rails and the rest of the parts, even on a 3D printed frame. After your stuff comes in, you can either 3D print and fuck around with getting the right 3D model, waiting many hours to fuck up the first print, repeating multiple times, and finally maybe getting something that will work, or you can buy the 80% lower and be committing your crime in a little less than an hour. I've done both (well, not the crime part. I legally register any guns I build like my state requires me to do) and to call the two paths equivalent is silly.
3D printing a handgun is currently a lot more involved than mail ordering a Polymer 80 kit and removing a few bits of plastic. Of course this ruling won’t completely prevent illegal possession of handguns, but it will reduce distribution to people who are prohibited from possessing firearms. If 3D printing becomes cheap and easy enough for anybody to do it, then that’s a different issue to address.
As someone who's taught 3d printing, I promise you it's not that simple. Most people can't print a functional door stop after taking a 6 hour course with me holding their hand the entire way.
