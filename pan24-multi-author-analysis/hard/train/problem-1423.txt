I could understand for government employees that work in PR/outreach and legitimately use social media to communicate with constituents and such. People in this thread mentioning other apps may forget that Twitter especially has been historically beneficial for elected officials to have a presence on.
For all those who think that social media should be banned on government devices, you're forgetting that politicians routinely communicate with the public on social media these days.
And despite the horrible outcomes of some of that communication, it's generally considered good that the public has more communication with their representatives.
If you ban all social media from gov't phones, we'll be back to the days of opaque governance, where the only places we can get information is websites and the media.
You’d think all social media would be banned from government devices. Hell all non-essential software should be. I haven’t had a single corporate job where either of those would have been acceptable and they could have easily gotten the attention of the cyber security folks.
