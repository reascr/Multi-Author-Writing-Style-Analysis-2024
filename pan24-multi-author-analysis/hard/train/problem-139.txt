Fuck the railroad and their horseshit. I hope the current companies crumble and new companies take over the existing infrastructure. Fuck em.
Who the fuck wants to put up with that shit? All the money in the world can't buy you more time to be with your friends and family. And considering the difficulty that railway employees have in simply scheduling a fucking doctor's appointment, that money can't even buy you good health!
My dad was a BLET rail engineer, and while he was paid well, I mainly remember how often he'd get called in, and how long he'd have to be at work for. And he retired before they started with their points system bullshit.
We're already seeing a massive exodus from railways. Low staffing issues are part of the issue that the unions are raising. And it isn't surprising, either.
This shouldn’t surprise anyone. You can think Biden is based for owning the right-wing loons, but the truth is that Joe has been a Renfield for corporate power his entire career. I need to underline this: he isn’t doing any of what he does for you. He is doing it because dysfunction is bad for business. If he could take us all back to the 1990s, he would. Would that be a good outcome for you?
