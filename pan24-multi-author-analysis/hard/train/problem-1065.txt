I heard Poland is yet to submit the request to Germany in the first place, which would be extremely ridiculous to say the least. Don't give the Russians the time to regroup and resupply! This war is catastrophic to Ukraine and its people, and costly to a world recovering from a global pandemic..
Send enough armor and weapons to Ukraine and let them kick those fuckin Russians back to Moscow so they can topple Putin and get it over with.
I think you're missing the point that Poland isn't submitting an application in the first place, and this is the problem.. not that Germany can't approve it.
Do you honestly think that if Poland had tried to send a request and that request would be ignored by the german government, that PiS would ever let us hear the end of it?
Poland in particular is in the news every day about how Germany isn't forthcoming, while Germany said (when asked) that they never got the necessary formal request to begin with.
If Germany were to actually consider the media report a valid request and approve it, the next time some politician in Poland talks to the media would need to be considered valid as well? Or only for members of the cabinet? What if it's just local press at some evening event with alcohol? Or a demand of Germany twittered by an attendee of the event? Do they need to monitor that and respond to it as well?
