The mental gymnastics ruzzia does to justify this bullshit is amazing. Even if that were true and Ukraine shot down a missile aimed at a military target and it landed on the apartment they are still responsible for firing it! I'm hoping after this is all over Ukraine will be able to bring those responsible for all these war crimes to justice.
It's more sustainable for Russia then it is Ukraine, a decent read with a realistic point of view from both sides.
It's a valid strategy to lie about your own casualty numbers though, and Ukraine is most definitely doing it too. And that's ok. It's just hard to know what to believe in terms of casualties and progress.
Basically the war right now can't be measured easily. And anyone playing up current "movements" in the line is full of shit.
No one on reddit has a clue about how the war is going, because the front isn't moving and neither side is going to broadcast their casualty numbers. Hell I don't even think the Russian command knows their real casualty numbers. Wagner isn't gonna be handing those stats over. However, because "lots of people died for no real gain" is a boring headline, news media really loves to play up tiny movements of the line as if it meant something.
