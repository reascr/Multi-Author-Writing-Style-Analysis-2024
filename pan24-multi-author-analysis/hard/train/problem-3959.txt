I am somewhat happy that they had the bubblegum flavor vapes, because it finally crashed this argument. Menthol is the most common "starter" cigarette, so banning is great for long term reduction.
For any smokers, listen to this talk on nicotine and smoking: The app, Smoke Free, helped get me off cigarettes. It shows all of your health improvements as time goes on. And the book, This Naked Mind: Nicotine, helped. And subscribe to r/stopsmoking.
Outside of the myriad health benefits, I have more time now. Every day was structured around smoking. And I've saved so much money.
I'm sitting here in my car on my break and vaping. My last cigarette was a few months ago. I voted for the ban. Now I'm working on quitting the vape too.
I'm not awfully out of shape, but running up a flight of stairs would leave me out of breath and sweating. I'm amazed now how easier every physical act is. My teeth are whiter than they've been in ages. I didn't know what really taking in a full breath was. I'm still so amazed by it that I'll deeply inhale and exhale, because it's a new sensation.
