Officially it's already a federal crime for the employer to hire undocumented workers, except in the case where they do the whole I-9 thing as required and fake paperwork genuinely fools the employer.

The problem is that neither party wants to totally destroy the restaurant and agricultural industries (among others) which depend on undocumented workers to do jobs Americans won't do under conditions Americans won't accept, that the Democrats don't want to make life even harder for the undocumented workers that would be impacted, and that the Republicans don't want to highlight how many huge Republican-donating big businesses they've been tacitly letting ignore the law while at the same time making it seem like all the blame deserves to be on the worker seeking the same kind of better life to which many of our ancestors had far easier access under far more open immigration regimes.
