Which is why UA should be allowed to attack those launch sites so Russia can't as easily bomb Ukraine's civilization infrastructure in petty retaliatory strikes.
There is no way in hell that Russia dares target any NATO target absent direct NATO involvement in Ukraine.
The idea that Russia will dare attack a NATO country because Ukraine uses NATO supplied weapons is simply laughable chicken little shit. They might be spouting a lot of bullshit propaganda, but they know NATO can curb stomp their military in a matter of days.
And you're fooling yourself if you don't think NATO is providing Ukraine with a ton of logistics and information to help them.
If you are Ukrainian I hope the war ends soon for you, but worrying about the consequences of a direct war between America and Russia isn't out of pocket.
And, no I don't think American missiles flying into Russia decreases the chances of direct confrontation and that much should be obvious to anyone.
So no I don't think there should be a no-fly zone, American boots on the ground, or American-made missiles whizzing over Kovrov.
And even if that happened it would still be doubtful that they would dare hit targets inside actual NATO territory. Putin _might_ be able to sell a withdrawal from Ukraine. He would not survive setting Russia on a suicidal course.
