But, you're not wrong. Our government at times has shown they prefer to heroically let people suffer than accept help or assistance from Germany, on principle. Thankfully this is not the case here (this time).
Those aren't gifted to Poland, they will be simply stationed in Poland instead of Germany for the time being.
No doubt though the Germans are making sure most of "their funds" they pay into there don't get into Polish hands. Cause you guys love us so much ðŸ˜‰.
Yeah thanks for that 20 years ago. How long you gonna keep clutching that. As if the Germans got no money out of that deal right?
Don't feel so bad, most of that money gets back into German hands through all those lovely rebates. If it didn't make pay for Germans to be in the EU they wouldn't be there.
Hey you got your handouts. Time for us to get ours. Sitting here on your perch acting all superior. Remind me how much the Americans helped your grandpappy out? He sure didn't blush stuffing those sweet greenbacks in his pockets. Also you still flying your helicopters exclusively over land since you let your armed forced fall into a rust heep? Again because of those fine American boys you got sitting within your boarders. If you're so great and independent why are they still there?
