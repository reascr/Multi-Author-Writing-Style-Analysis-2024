Turkey claims a lot of things, it's just that they're mostly on their own with their claims. We could lose ourselves in topic of Kurdistan but what matters for this topic right here is that Turkey has no right to meddle with the people of Syria, the same as Russia has no right to meddle with the Ukrainian people. And letting Erdogan get through with one thing while (rightly) not letting Putin get through with the other is a double standard.
We already have been allowing Erdogan to wage his war against the Kurds for like what, 2 years now? We're still allowing him to murder Kurds. And before that we allowed him to in the Syrian war who then . Let's not pretend that NATO is not implicit in this when we conveniently turn a blind eye on turkish fascism.
I'm not talking about the PKK but the YPG. The assaults on them in Syria, on foreign soil, are definitely part of Erdogan's term. And as far as I know is Turkey the only country that considers YPG a terrorist organisation.
Interesting, Turkey claims the YPG is just a rebrand of PKK. Some independent groups have also made the same connection.
Also, take a closer look at the Kurdish protests in sweden or Finland next time. They wave pkk flags and Cary pictures of the leader.
