it's a bit myopic but it's technically correct. the fault really lies with gingrich's abuse of the cameras; but if they weren't there, he wouldn't have been able to ratfuck congress.
Another representative had to be held back from attacking Gaetz, so that’s probably why he wants more cameras. Either way, I agree that C-SPAN should have cameras in there so citizens can actually see and hear what’s happening.
I can see where you’re coming from, we’re going to get a lot more grandstanding and political stunts for the cameras. I’m not sure how to prevent that, so I agree it’s a valid concern lol speaking personally, I’ve never had more of an actual idea of what congresspeople do than I do now after having watched all of the speaker votes. I felt it was informative getting to see them mingling during breaks, and doubly so being able to join the live Reddit chat where people posted clips, articles, etc. during the proceedings. It may not be as authentic as that was, but I’ve never been more engaged in what’s happening and I’m all for others getting to have a similar experience.
I 100% agree, and also that makes those 5 days that much funnier lol “I’m going to keep humiliating you on national tv until you agree to let me keep doing it for the next two years”.
I fully support this, C-span was having the time of their life and I was there for it lol I strongly believe this is an effective way to get more voters interested and involved.
