Maybe perhaps for a single solitary moment we can not be so fucking self-centered as to make this about Republicans and the U.S. when a literal genocide is taking place on the other side of the world...?
One is committing literal genocide and conquering the neighbors and threaten global nuclear war. The other is a political party you disagree with. Yeah, Republicans are shit. But so are you. Get your fucking head out of your ass and start worrying more about the actual atrocities we're watching happen in real time than finding a way to bash the right in a Reddit thread. Please grow up. There's a time and a place, and this ain't it.
Yeah, and that's fine, but perhaps keep your opinion that nobody asked for to yourself when we're in a thread about Russian soldiers kidnapping Ukrainian children from hospitals and commiting genocide.
And it's not just children but they deport anyone they can deep into Russia as far from Ukraine as they can with the aim to replace the people that left Russia and the Russian soldiers who died in the war.
Abduct Ukrainian children while sending drug addict prisoners, poor and ethnic region population to death in Ukraine.
Russians did what Ukranians should of done and evacuated orphans from the war zones and not use children as human shields. As for the claim by the Ukrainian doctor it's pretty typical for Ukrainian propaganda.
