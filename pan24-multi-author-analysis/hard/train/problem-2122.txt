Businesses are quite literally designed so that you can walk away if it fails and not be ruined yourself. This applies to any incorporated business and is why even if you just sell $5 toys on Etsy, you need to make an LLC go cover your own assets.
The person I commented on said that Twitter cannot go bankrupt until he runs out of money because he is personally liable for any and all expenses and costs. My entire comment was that he can only be liable for what he leveraged in the deal, they cannnot go after his personal finances or assets if he decides to walk away or file bankruptcy as the company, which is filing bankruptcy there’s no guarantee they get all of the leveraged assets depending in the title of bankruptcy filed which is also something the comment I replied to said he cannot file for anymore to protect assets.
It absolutely can. Private companies can still file for bankruptcy without him personally doing so. He would end up forfeiting most if not all assets he leveraged to purchase Twitter but they don’t have free reign to go after all of his money and assets.
But to put it succinctly, he can't loose more than the total value of his stake in the now non-public Twitter corporation unless he decides to pump more money.
It's more so that you can't hide your profits with buying licenses from your daughter / parent / sister company, throw it all back into new projects or buy back stock and act like you don't have money.
