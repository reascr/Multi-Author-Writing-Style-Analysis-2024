Wasn't there a leak a little while back about how Russia was trying to decide between war with Japan over the contested island or Ukraine, and they ultimately chose Ukraine. I mean this makes a lot of since.
I’m sure it was meant recently. The Japanese haven’t had a standing army since WW2, initially because of the occupation, but more recently by choice.
Also, as an American.. I’m pretty up to date on Imperial Japanese atrocities in WW2. However, we created deliberate Firestorms during our strategic bombings of the Japanese mainland.
You can examine the voting history of the last couple of decades and see the Japanese population staunchly against supporting anything other than their Defense Force.
Japan has been tolerating a strong Chinese presence for decades, and continue to tolerate it regardless of their own impending buildup. No one in the region can do anything but tolerate it, as fighting a large overseas war in this age is impossible for anyone to win with the one exception being the US. Every country has a violent history, and any anger over Japan’s buildup should be directed at regional players who talk and act aggressively, forcing their peers to buildup or risk invasion. China and Russia had a pacifist nation on their eastern doorstep, but due to their aggressive rhetoric and expansionist plans, they’ll have a neighbour who will hit them back.
While the government might realise they need to build up a better fighting force to combat both Russia and China, the sentiment is not shared with the population.
