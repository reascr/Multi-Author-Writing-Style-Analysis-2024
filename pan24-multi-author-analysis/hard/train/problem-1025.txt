The problem is that, by the numbers, Texas is significantly less Republican than it projects. The split is somewhere between 60-40 or 55-45 % red versus blue, which is within striking distance of flipping.
However Republicans consistently hold majorities-even supermajorities (2/3) of the seats. The reason is that Texas has some of the worst Gerrymandering in the country and is barely a democracy at this point.
The Texas Democratic Party has nobody to blame but themselves for losing elections. And it's not even that Republicans are all that popular. NOBODY in Texas actually likes Abbott, Cruz or Paxton. Not many people actually liked Perry either. It's that the Texas Democratic Party is so poorly run, that a lot of Texans don't even know who the Democratic candidate is, let alone want to vote for them. If they can't beat fucking Abbott, Cruz Paxton, or Perry, then they're absolutely incompetent.
That might sound harsh, but when you haven't won a meaningful election in almost 30 years, keep bringing out a candidate who has lost twice already and thinks saying "Hell yes, we're coming for your AR-15s" in TEXAS, that's incompetence. When you lose by double digits to a governor who caused Texans to freeze to death and responded to an elementary school shooting with "It could have been worse", AS WELL AS an attorney general who's under indictment, despite all of them having sub-50% approval ratings AND more than half of Texans saying the state is headed in the wrong direction, that's the definition of incompetent.
