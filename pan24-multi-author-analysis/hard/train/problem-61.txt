Trump himself is expected to face criminal referrals, reportedly for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, and insurrection. Referrals are also expected for other Trump allies, including Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has suggested referrals for ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations may also be issued. However, the Committee's referrals are non-binding and it will be up to federal prosecutors to bring charges.
BREAKING: RASKIN: CRIMINAL REFERRALS: You tasked us to form a subcommittee to determine whether criminal referrals should be made.
The referral will have no actual basis for either Garland or Smith because they're already doing the investigation the Committee is asking for.
The Committee did A LOT of work and they got a lot of information out over the last couple of months. If they feel that these are the appropriate charges (there could be more), then I can only imagine that DOJ will find something similar.
What it does do, I think, is give us some insight into what DOJ may end up finding / charging Trump (and others) with.
