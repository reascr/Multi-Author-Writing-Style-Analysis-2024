Genocide is the deliberate attempt at driving a race, ethnicity, nation, or culture to extinction. It doesn't matter how you go about it, the end result is the same. It's genocide.
This is genocide, the destruction of a people and culture. We are going to end up with the same result regardless if Putin ordered Ukrainians killed by gas chambers en masse or children kidnapped.
Either way, we agree that what Russia is doing is despicable and the fact that they are genocidal in more than one way makes the situation even more horrific.
Apologies for being pedantic here, I agree with this statement of yours, which is why I am refering to the definition determined by the United Nations and not a colloquial understanding of the word. Taking away children of a group in order to prevent them from being raised into their initial culture is an act of genocide. Killing members of a specific group is of course also an act of genocide.
Exactly! This is no place for Euphemisms, Russia is straight up commiting genocide. it's also what Ottomans/Turks did when they enslaved Greece. Kidnapped children and brainwashed them to be Genitsaroi, soldiers made to hunt down and fight their own kind.
The boy children will be trained for war and the girl children will be put through forced pregnancies when they all come of age.
Their population growth is stagnant for over over 30 years. The war is killing off their able bodied men.
