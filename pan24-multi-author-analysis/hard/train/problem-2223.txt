Yea and I’d agree in most other cases it’s obviously not direct extortion but it’s using personal information as leverage for financial gain. “Oh you want privacy you previously could opt in or out of? Well jk pay me 8$ a month to keep that”.
But it’s still stupid to pay the same amount I pay for Spotify and STILL have ads. Imagine listening to an album and every like 10 songs it’s just “thanks for paying the bills, we think you’ll love Febreeze!”.
For instance, the best way to use twitter (imo) is to follow funny accounts you like and enjoy engaging with. Then use pinned lists for other things. So I have pinned lists for news, politics, instead eating stuff etc. that way the algorithm is keeping me amused but I have the option of diving into another group if I want. So much humour you find elsewhere on stems from twitter (and now TikTok).
There’s just so much odd dialogue around Twitter in general that I’m kinda burned out in it. Personally I feel like the platform is dead and folks who are holding on are just grasping at straws - but I understand their frustration, there really isn’t a similar platform to jump to.
