Underwater drones need to be spotted by sonar or similar and these method don't provide a firing solution so your defense options are more limited.
There are no underwater drones in this conflict, you just made that up, second I wasn't expecting a boats can't attack tanks reponse, and third I would guess the drone boats can carry magnitudes more explosives equivalent to a U.S. Predator drone which can sink massive ships, would be my guess.
Ok, I apologize for my first statement. But I wouldn't trust anything that starts with "Russia says", its usually 180 reverse. And lastly these are the water drones I've only heard about by reading and seeing their POV attack videos First time hearing there are submarine drones in the works.
Note however that you cannot use a water drone to hit a land vehicle. Wheeled drones have their own set of guidance problems, while not many of the water drones benefits.
A couple of sources have referred to the drones as semi submersible. Probably the most accurate description.
Think about it like this. These drones don't need air. Battery operated propulsion, no crew. So the lower it goes the harder it is to detect. However diving deep below the surface interferes with remote control, radio doesn't work underwater. Also requires depth control systems, unnecessary cost and complexity.
