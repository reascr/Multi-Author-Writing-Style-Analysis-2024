Plus, this bill will singlehandedly make the Democrats lose midterms and paralyze Congress for the last two years of Biden's presidency. It's unfortunate, but the Federal Reserve's monetary policy has failed to clamp down on inflation and the IRA Act will be seen by Democrats as "too little" (decreasing turnout) and by Republicans as "focusing on the wrong problem" (increasing turnout).
And I mean fine, honest mistake, but at least own up to it. Biden initially promised 550 billion, and I think we all wish it was actually 740 billion.
Maybe if the US actually helped with renewable technologies manufacturing instead of, y'know, freezing out semiconductors?
I mean, if America wants to send a consistent message, maybe they'd start manufacturing renewable technologies instead of relying on supply from Asian manufacturers?
To clarify your comment, the pledge is that western powers and latin american countries have to switch to renewable sources starting now while India and China dont have to start or reduce emissions until 2030.
