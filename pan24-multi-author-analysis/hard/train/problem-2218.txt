No, that is not the populism were talking about. The relevant populism is dividing the population into a pure and idealized regular "people" vs an evil and scheming "elite". Hence right wing populists like the Trump movement hating "the elite " who they believe use minorities as a weapon to destroy our culture, and left wing populists who believe everything is the fault of "the powers that be" and "the corporations". Communism and fascism are both populist.
Democracy at it's core is populism. Majority rules based on what the majority finds popular. Self governance at it's core is populism. Governing yourself is more popular to you than having someone govern you.
No, it's standard corporate propaganda. Don't look right, don't look left, just stay exactly where you are and the problems will just magically go away.
It's just scaring the audience into standing still in the middle. If the right is crazy, the left must be too otherwise you might have to actually cede the left's point that the right is crazy.
Some grifters want to make the left more griftable rather than move to the right, but when that fails they just move to the right anyway.
These people are grifters, and grifters generally tend to discover that the right is far more griftable than the left.
