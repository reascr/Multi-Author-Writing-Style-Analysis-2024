GA has Brad Raffensburger, while he was part of preventing the trump crime, he instituted the “can’t offer water to voters in line”. Ya know, the ones who have to stand in line for 8+ hours.
They also include questions that are worded with double negatives and extraneous words to confuse whether you are voting for or against something. It’s bizarre and incredibly sad.
Which is just insane to me. In my Canadian city of 80,000 ppl I’ve never waited longer than 10 mins to vote (often much less) in the 25 years I’ve been voting.
In the burbs the voting experience is way easier / shorter waits compared to urban polling places...
i mean, they could theoretically still win elections, they would just have to like, do some work and develop some sound policy that works for voters to want to vote for them cuz that whiny scared of brown/non-binary people shit is kinda tired.
it seems more of a problem in southern states where state legislatures are mostly repubican, and actively trying to make it harder to vote in urban centers.
when i lived in queens there were a few times where it took about an hour to vote, because of the number of voters mainly, but voting in the jersey burbs is pretty much instant..the longest part is waiting for the senior citizen poll volunteer to figure out how to get the form back up on the tablet, cuz technology.
