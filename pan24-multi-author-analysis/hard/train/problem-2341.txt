I demand to speak to the manager of Twitter because I don't understand that I agreed to their terms of service and I also don't understand what the 1st amendment to the constitution means.
How does she still not understand that Twitter is not a government service and therefore not bound by constitutional proclivities?
The fact that she can voice her opinion, and express concern about whatever Twitter did, suggests she is not in fact limited in her freedom of speech.
This is criticism of lack of free speech from the perspective of a bias moron who wants the audience exposure Twitter offers and the right to spew incorrect or knowingly egregious disinformation.
Number of users does not equate to it automatically being subject to free speech or being villainized for someone else's perception of the platform violating what they feel are their free speech rights.
You can find another platform to spew your nonsense. You are just pissy because you want access to the number of people on Twitter and because it's popularized.
Twitter tomorrow could post dinosaurs roam the earth again or that aliens are harvesting human brains for China or some shit. Doesn't matter its a private platform.
