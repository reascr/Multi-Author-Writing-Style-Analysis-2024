Back when I taught college ESL, I had a young Saudi student who tried to bribe his way into a better grade by offering to buy me a building on the campus.
I was pretty skeptical; I said, "Abdullah, this is level 3 English writing. You have to write me a page. Save the building for the freshman comp teacher who is going to make you write a research paper.".
Sort of. Our primary adversary has explicitly stated they intend to at least match our military by 2050. They are almost certainly spending more than what it seems on paper and they’re getting more for their money than we do, so on paper spending is misleading. They’ve been undergoing modernization for decades now.
Whether or not they will be able to catch us as they intend to though is an open question… There is an excellent hour long video on this by Perun if you want to watch it.
I’m not trying to fearmonger or anything, I’m only saying the competition with this particular country is in all aspects you can name. It’s not like they’re particularly shy about that desire.
