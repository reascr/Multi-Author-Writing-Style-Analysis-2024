Some of the land was given to us by the rulers of it (British). Other parts were won in wars the Arab population declared on us, trying to destroy our country. Calling it "Stolen" is a complete lie.
About the WB, I agree the settlements need to stop. But it would never happen when Palestinians don't even acknowledge Israel's right to exist and only operate with violence against innocent men, women and children.
Based on your rudeness, I would be very surprised to find out you know more about the Islamic revolution in Iran than I do (Not that I'm an expert by any means). Whatever man, you do you.
Everything that can be realistically done should be done. Even making 100% sure the violent regime won't get it's hands on nuclear bombs will go a very long way into giving the people a chance.
Yes, and Iran knows this, which is why they've structured their nuclear weapons program to make it impossible to wipe it out with a one-off strike like this.
That's a good point, the Saudis couldn't accept nuclear blackmail from Iran so they would get the bomb very quickly as well. Talk about making the middle east even more unstable.
