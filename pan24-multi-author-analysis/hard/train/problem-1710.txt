That's because the majority of them don't even know what or who they are actually voting for. They have 1 hot button issue like gun control that they hold near and dear and that's the extent of their political knowledge. They know Republicans "allegedly" would never take their precious guns away and they know Democrats have talked about doing it. That is literally enough for them to forever vote Republican regardless of anything else.
Most Republicans are 100% supporting the ruling class (some are just massive grifters looking out for themselves only). Anything they propose or any vote they make is to screw over most so that it can give just a tiny bit more power to the few that they represent.
Farm subsidies have been weaponized against actual farmers and used to help massive corporations make silly profits.
So rather than farmers stripping the land bare to make a few extra bucks, we subsidize them - paying them as if they grew crops, but without the ecological damage. It's not the best solution, but it the one that works with this type of people in this type of system.
