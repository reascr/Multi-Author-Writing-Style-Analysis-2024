I don't think it has as much influence as it used to. I believe at this point plain old streaming movies and tv shows is driving innovation. And blu ray was more of a Sony PS3 thing than what was available for porn on that format.
I will have to go back and look at blu ray v hd dvd. I remember at the time reading articles about how porn wasn't really a player in the decision and it was more ps3 sales with a blu ray player and other industry choices that led to blu ray winning. And was porn even a factor in the 4k standard? I would think that was driven mainly by tv and movie content distribution and not so much porn.
Interesting to think it could be a cultural myth that porn decided vhs v. beta when it might just be simple market quirks that can decide these things. My dad was an early adopter and got vhs while my cousins family got beta. Not sure why they chose those formats but it's safe to say porn wasn't a deciding factor for them.
But porn wasn't the deciding factor in blu ray v. hd dvd. And like I said, there's enough non porn streaming content now that porn doesn't have the same influence it used to.
