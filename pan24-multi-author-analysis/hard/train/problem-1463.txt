I don't think people realize just how crazy this could get. If they have a 2 person majority a BoBo the Clown, MTG, etc could keep McCarthy out of the speaker spot. But it's a general vote by Congress so Dems could nominate someone, literally anyone, and vote for them as speaker...with just 2 Republican votes. Oh and anyone who hasn't been sworn in due to recount? They don't get to vote. This is going to be good.
There needs to be a majority of votes for a Speaker or the session of Congress can't begin. Longest it's ever gone is 2 months. Literally nothing gets done until they pick a speaker. It's further complicated by recounts where they can't swear in until the recount is done. I doubt it would be Pelosi but if there are a handful of hold outs someone like Kitzinger could be a compromise where maybe moderates of both parties vote for him.
Pelosi can hold together the Democratic coalition, no one on the Right will be able to keep them together....there's too much batshittery on the right.
Honestly, I hope Dem votes come through, HOWEVER... the GOP only having a vote or two majority trying to hold that putrid coalition together would be really fun to watch.
Can you imagine so many factions and none with a majority so that a potential speaker has to get dem votes? You could negotiate some nice trade-offs, like chair of some committees.
