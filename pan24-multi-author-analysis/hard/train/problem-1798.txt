You can deny Climate Change (tm) and still think that pollution and abuse of the environment is a grave matter. Climate change to me means crush the middle class and purposefully make energy expensive so businesses can continue to not innovate or shift their operations. Climate change also signifies the strategy companies took in the 70s by saying itâ€™s the average citizen that needs to bear the burden of fixing things and not companies.
There's a scenario where society spends so much time/money repairing the damage from climate-related disasters, that we have no time/money left to build out sustainable infrastructure.
The issue is, current consumption isn't sustainable because it's powered almost entirely by fossil fuels.
Unsustainable consumption is an issue, because it terminates itself often in ways that are irreversibly destructive (e.g. extinction of species). The other issue is external costs of production, e.g. pollutants which cause climate change, among other issues.
We need to take care of the planet and climate change is real. We don't need to panic and definitely don't give more money and power to billionaire prophets prognosticators.
