Christmas is just a stolen pagan holiday, which is why it's in December and has nothing to do with Jesus' birth. A lot of people will say that they made a Jesus version of the pagan party to be more inclusive, but the opposite is true. The Church (as an arm of political power) was pressured into a December 25th celebration because people were abandoning the church as it was forbidden to celebrate the pagan holiday even though it was so popular.
My understanding is that using December 25 was Christian’s appropriating a pagan celebration (I wanna say winter solstice) to make it more enticing for pagans to join in.
Christians just co-opted Saturnalia from the Romans, including lightning candles and the practice of gift giving, to give Christians a holiday to celebrate while the rest of the Roman Empire was celebrating a “pagan” holiday.
The existing Saturnalia festival which occurred over several days, featured exchanging of gifts, and was a rare time when Rome was lit at night by candlelight.
