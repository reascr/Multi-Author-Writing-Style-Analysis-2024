Heinrich XIII, 71, belongs to the House of Reuss, an ancient royal lineage that ruled parts of what is now Thuringia in central Germany for hundreds of years until 1918. It is now one of Germanyâ€™s 16 federal states.
So even before 1918, he would not have been Kaiser. That would be the Hohenzollern family, who came to rule Brandenburg, became kings of Prussia and then Kaisers of Germany - from Wilhelm 1 (1871) to Wilhelm II (abdicated in 1918). There are living descendants of the family too.
Kings rule by divine right . Your ascent to the throne might see folks suggest that is heaven smiling upon you (Chinese have ) But you will find plenty of people willing to dispute the same. Until your power cows and winnows enough. Some other pedigree of legitimacy is usually found in the west. With enough power, often the documentation will follow. Or marriage alliances.
Reuss is just one of the many branches of German royalty, many of which have familial links across the rest of Europe, some of them to the British royal family.
They were not even at the same level of middling German family like the Wittlesbach of Bavaria, let alone the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasty.
There are a handful of German royal families that could make a semi legitimate claim to the throne if the throne was restored. His is not one of them by a long long ways.
