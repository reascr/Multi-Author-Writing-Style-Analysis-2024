It... really isn't bullet-proof except on the federal level. Many states still ban gay marriage and would likely dissolve marriages done since gay marriage was legalized.
A law doesn't have to be perfect, just functional, and this protects LGBT marriages today. It is a major step forward for us to make sure we don't slide backward. Not to mention it repeals the existing law defining marriage as between a man and a woman, a major legislative roadblock in the past. Yes, there is still progress to be made, but you're letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.
The obvious answer is that they made it easy to swallow and bulletproof. We're not trying to end homophobia with this law, we're trying to protect LGBT and interracial marriages today so that the Supreme Court can't take the right away as they have signalled they will.
This protects every existing gay and interracial marriage in the US as well as protects every gay and interracial marriage in the future. Yes, there is still work to be done to get those other states to allow gay and interracial marriages, but that will either require a social change to vote in better politicians, or a constitutional change to eliminate any gray area with the first amendment.
Nah, itâ€™s because it allows (if Obergefell is rolled back) states like Utah and North Carolina to openly ban gay marriage again, as long as they recognize them when their residents elope to Hawaii.
