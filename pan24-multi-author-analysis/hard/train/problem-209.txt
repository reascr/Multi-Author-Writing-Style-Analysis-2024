I have an obsession with remote, cold city/town/villages and I’ve been looking at towns throughout Siberia on google earth lately. I am kind of convinced that the Russian government has put a lot of money into these extreme locations, both infrastructure and creating jobs there. Siberia seems to have a pretty significant amount of these extremely hostile cities whereas Canada and Alaska do not seem to have as many. All these cities and towns have a couple of massive residential buildings whereas in Canada and Alaska it’s more just cabins or houses.
I want to visit places like that, but I think I would hate the lifestyle very quickly living in places like Yakutsk, Svalbard or any other extreme remote area. Especially the darkness of winter (I think I would like the cold, however). But yea I love exploring google earth.
Is your obsession that you want to live there, or just that you like exploring them on Google Earth? Because if it's the latter, same. But not cold ones, just any remote, desolate town in America. I can spend hours skimming over the remote areas of Oregon or Arizona, following the highways in and out, imagining life there.
