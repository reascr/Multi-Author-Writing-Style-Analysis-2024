I forget what documentary I was watching specifically, but they were interviewing a Bradley commander from the first gulf war. A pair of Bradleys caught a number of entrenched T-72s off-guard and annihilated them with TOWs. The 25mm Cannon is more or less useless against the armor, but it'll still scare the piss out of a tank crew when they're being pounded repeatedly in the turret by it.
They would get shredded by a tank round, but the optics, AT missiles, and stabilization allow them to avoid being in the enemy tank's range. They were very effective against Iraqi T72s.
Actually M2 Bradleys using TOW missiles destroyed more Iraqi T-72 tanks in the Gulf War than the Abrams MBTs did.
Bradleys were the top ground tank killer of Desert Storm, F-111s were the top aerial tank killer of it. Neither get anywhere near the credit they deserve for how damn good and effective they were.
Yup! fast and good sensors means you can identify the target from far out, hit it once you're there, and be gone before air defenses even get a chance to start shooting. A-10s are comparatively as slow as the plane flying the banners at the beach in the summer lol.
Essentially, a baby B-1 bomber used for high speed tactical bombing missions. In Desert Storm it used its ground scanning radar to find targets way out ahead of it, its laser designator to paint at targeting beam on them, and dropped laser guided bombs to destroy roughly 28% of all Iraqi armor lost in the war.
