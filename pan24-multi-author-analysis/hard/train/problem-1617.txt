From what I know about the iron dome(which isn’t much granted), it’s primarily meant to stop low altitude, low velocity projectiles like mortars, artillery, RPG, etc.
It is “impossible” in the sense that it wouldn’t protect against the high velocity of Russian missiles or the large number of artillery.
Only for a short time, until Russia runs so low on rocket ammo that they can’t fire more than they can produce.
Interceptors are valuable. Ukrainian lives are more valuable. And all those Russia rockets will sooner or later be fired into one or into the other.
The only thing you get to control is whether you use iron dome to intercept some of those that do get fired.
Also, I’d rather their remaining ammo get fired into an iron dome than into a Ukrainian civilian flesh dome.
Which, considering the size of the Ukraine battlespace, would also be present and not plugged by the Iron Dome.
Keep in mind, contextually I was speaking on an iron dome system for Ukraine. The cost, supply chain, and land mass talking points were all to say western nations need their advanced arms, can’t produce them at scale for other non NATO allies, and fear them getting into enemy hands.
