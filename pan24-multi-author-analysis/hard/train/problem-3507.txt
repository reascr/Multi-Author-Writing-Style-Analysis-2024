Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu announced the formation of the most far-right government in the country’s history Wednesday night, marking the return of its longest-serving leader and granting an unprecedented portion of power to his far-right and ultra-Orthodox allies who have vowed to make sweeping changes in the country.
Netanyahu’s ultranationalist, ultra Orthodox political allies have announced plans to change the Law of Return, a 1950 law that guarantees citizenship for all Jews, from any country in the world, who can prove to have at least one Jewish grandparent and which is widely seen as a fundamental legislative framework through which Israel supports the diversity of the world Jewish community.
Other radical far-right coalition members have called to legitimize Israeli settlements in the West Bank in a way that operationally, if not legally, sets the stage for Israeli annexation of that disputed territory, and would signal the end of any prospects for a two-state solution, in which a Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel.
Should clarify though, and im not saying this is your stance specifically, but “fuck the Israeli government” (which I agree with) is not the same as “Israel was a mistake and should cease to exist”- which most Jews disagree with, and is often expressed on threads about actions of whatever Israeli government is in power.
It was a bit of a joke - I have been criticizing the Israeli government for years, and almost always get called anti-Semitic for it despite very clearly making my statements about the government.
If someone criticizes segregation and apartheid carried on by the Israeli government - - then no antisemitism.
\- compare Israel to Nazi Germany (if you feel strongly enough that Israel is authoritarian, there is a wide range of other, better comparisons to choose from, that do not weaponize Jewish history).
Yeah I’m with this - Israeli fascist government doesn’t erase actual anti-semitism and the resurgence of far right nazi-like ideologies - even if the names change.
