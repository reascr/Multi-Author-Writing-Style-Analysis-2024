I don't care. It is all hearsay. So what the laptop belongs to Hunter. So what it isn't "tampered". Who cares.

That isn't your source article. The NY Post is a rag and generally they mix BS with sprinkles of truth. The NY Post has a good sports section and horoscope as well as Page Six gossip. That is it.
Yeah. I have my disagreements with Nate silver but he is absolutely right when he says people are freaking out about a sample size of two. He rightly pointed out that the 2018 polls actually underestimated Democrats. Polling errors do not always favor one party or the other. Pulling errors have gotten greater since the prevalence of spam calls and the reduction in landlines has made polling more difficult. However, we now see that the polling error can swing one way or the other, just as it always has.
