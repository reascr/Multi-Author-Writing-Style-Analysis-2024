And any "charitable" donations his foundation actually does make will be to right-wing think tanks, not organizations people truly consider charities. His refusal to name any organizations that are actually receiving donations from his foundation makes it clear that's what his "giving to charities" actually is.
The charitable Foundation lets you donate the money to charity right now and get the tax break and the money can only be used for charitable purposes from that point forward. Then you have time to figure out how and when you want to donate that money to charity. It can be invested in the meantime, and you've effectively created an endowment where you and your successors can continue to make big charitable donations for a long time.
That doesn't mean it can't be abused. You can donate money to your friend's charity. You can hire your kids to run the charity and pay them salaries etc. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have a legitimate purpose.
Yes, it is. But you can't necessarily just walk to your local Humane Society and write them a check for 30 million dollars. If you're writing them that big of a check you reasonably want to know what they're going to do with it.
So you create a nonprofit company. And you call that non-profit company a charitable foundation. It's just like any other charity except it's main purpose is writing checks to other Charities rather than doing work itself.
Now capital gains taxes add another layer of complexity and potential for fraud because stock can be donated straight to the charity without paying capital gains taxes.
