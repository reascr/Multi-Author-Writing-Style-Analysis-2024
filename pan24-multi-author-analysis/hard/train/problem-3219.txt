Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York delivered an impassioned speech defending Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota as Republicans seek to remove Ms Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
House Republicans have sought to remove Ms Omar for comments they consider antisemitic, for which Ms Omar apologised. But Democrats say that Republicans are engaging in Islamophobia.
Do you honestly believe the Republican party is the party of antisemitism?! If yes, .... why? If no, please go be disingenuous alone somewhere rather than polluting the waters here.
Who do you look up to in comparison? If no one (believing that people suck in general is a fair point of view lol), that's fine. But really curious who you support.
Why does not supporting Israel automatically make you an anti-Semite? And how does supporting Israel automatically make you NOT an anti-Semite? And AIPAC DOES fund politicians. Like all lobbyists, they expect something to come from their money, and their stated purpose is a close American-Israeli relationship. Israel has an unusually strong hold over America compared to any of our other foreign relationships. Even if the whole relationship is above board, shouldn't we be carefully scrutinizing such a critical relationship? Also, Hamas isn't a country. Where and how did she support it?
