In Russia, if they take down an oligarch or celeb, it’s because Putin wanted to, to make an example, to eliminate an enemy, or just because he cannot be trusted. Ordinarily they just kill the people that can actually damage the Putin autocracy.
Nothing says that they can’t continue looking at the more serious crimes as he’s facing prosecution for the ones they have him dead to rights on. The J6 investigation goes onwards as well, although that won’t see him facing any charges. He also was caught red handed doing tax fraud, no other investigation is needed to prove that. He’s dead to rights on that as well. Same thing with Raffensbugers taped order to commit election fraud, another blatant crime he’s guilty of, yet not charged for.
Indicting a former President for crimes he committed while in office has never been done. And although Trump had been in literally thousands of lawsuits in his life, he’s acquired an army of lawyers and ‘friends’ to protect him. His handpicked merry billionaire Cabinet Secretaries was no accident. They perfected the ideal tax bill. Behind closed doors with not an economist or Democrat in the room. Guided only by phone calls from wealthy donors and not pesky debates, hearings or investigations. Done in 51 days. The loopholes are substantial and they just get wealthier and wealthier. And they protect him. I trust Merrick Garland. He’s being very very careful. It IS so frustrating! But if you look at Trump snd watch him. He’s running scared. Being a candidate doesn’t protect him.
