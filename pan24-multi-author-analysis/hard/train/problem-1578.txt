I think that all people everywhere want the same basic things, to be comfortable and happy and to be able to provide for and protect the people they love. I have nothing but empathy for the average Russian person who had no say in this. It’s the ultra rich and entitled like Putin that don’t care about anyone.
I think it’s a mix of those who have likely been run over by the hyper nationalistic and state controlled media, actual hardliners, and people afraid of saying the wrong thing. Props to those who have spoken out knowing the consequences.

Their long-held hatred for certain people had been validated so they dropped the facade. Trump didn't turn these people into what they are. He only told them that there's nothing wrong with them with feeling their bigotry and hatred. It's the world that's wrong.

Trump just blew the lid open and spilled all the putrid cesspool all in the open.
