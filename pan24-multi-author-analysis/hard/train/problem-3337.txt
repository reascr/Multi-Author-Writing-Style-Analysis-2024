Do you know what's really funny? The West underestimating a new and untested naval technology developed by the East and then getting their asses handed to them for their hubris. That surely hasn't happened before, especially with something like an aircraft carrier.
Pride. They're also probably not going to use it like the US does, at least not with traditional aircraft. I think they're going the way of China and see carriers as massive drone motherships instead of landing areas for piloted aircraft. If you're using drones you might not even need a runway, saving lots of space that you can use for even more drones. Iran has shown they're developing drone technology. For what it's worth, I think that's their plan.
Honestly, I think this could actually be a good idea. I have no doubt that they will fuck something up in the execution/operation of it, but given the constraints on Iran as as well as the drone based future of arial warfare, I think its a solid concept.
Iran has been using drones for quite a while now and considering all these benefits it’s a no brained they’d try and increase that capability.
