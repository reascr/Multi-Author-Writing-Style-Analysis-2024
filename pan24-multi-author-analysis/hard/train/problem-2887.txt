??? "Intrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts, images, impulses, or urges that can occur spontaneously or that can be cued by external/internal stimuli" how is 'i get those irrational bad thoughts when I see couples like this because of awful stories like this" not the exact definition of unwanted intrusive thoughts. Do YOU know what it means bc evidently not??
Wait WHAT woah ok that came out of left field. No that's not - that's not even remotely the same I - ok, I see theres actually 0 interest in what I am actually saying and these comments are being emotionally driven now. I'm peacing out lol I wasn't even fucking agreeing with op at all but I guess I get to be the scapegoat for just pointing out that they did in fact acknowledge it wasn't fair.quick edit actually, just to clarify dude i literally keep saying over and over i agree with you that one can work on their thoughts idk why you keep going.
Edit: apparently reddit doesn't know the difference between intrusive thoughts and active belief systems smh. I get to be the scapegoat for people that got mad at op . hi downvoters.
