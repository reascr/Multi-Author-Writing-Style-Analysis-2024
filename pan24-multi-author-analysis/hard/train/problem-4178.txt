Those balloons fly at 20km. Lowest satellite ever was stabilized at 164km high, but most spy satellites are twice that height. This x16 difference means you can skip on high end camera, and use something much cheaper. And the cost of launch (balloon vs rocket) is night and day as well. Not to mention if you can land it in international water, you can actually salvage it back. This could be cost effective over satellite, or an alternative to satellite.
There is also radio wave that bounce at 100km on the ionosphere. Flying under it might make it easier to pick up certain signal, but who knows what they had on that balloons.
Balloons don't have that problem and can loiter long times over a location. They also can intercept radio communication (for example cell phones) that wouldn't reach high enough to be reasonably picked up by satellites.
They fly much higher, so it's far more difficult to get good pictures. Also the closer they get, the faster they move on their orbit. So you can't stay in good position to observe one location for more than minutes.
