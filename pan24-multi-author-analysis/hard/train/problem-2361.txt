Impossible to swap electronics between machines (so if you have a busted-out transmission in one machine, and a failing computer in the other you have two PzH2000 out of action), autoloader works great until you fight Russians in the eastern front for months and once it breaks impossible to fix in the field and impossible to manually load the gun (PzH2000 out of action again). So in summary, it works great when it works, but when it fails, you need to pull the thing out of the combat for a damn long time. You can look it up if you don't believe me.
Doubt it. I bet there's a lot of pressure not to "escalate" with more modern weapons. And while yes, there are himars, etc there, I'm betting that sending modern tanks would be used by Russia to say nato has "joined", and would escalate them to use nukes... They're already chomping at that bit, and the more they lose, the more cornered they are. So I highly doubt you'll see any of these, or leopards, being sent there.... Not to mention the logistical issues this would create.
That being said, it's also a great time to modernize and spend, as public support is really high (see what I said above) , so there's not going to be a better time than now... With the added bonus of also propping up your own industry and add with that thetechnology transfer etc. It's kind of a no brainer.
Russia occupied Poland for 50 years. Everyone there remembers that, and wants no part to bringing that filth back! Also, the last time Poland relied on its allies to come to our rescue... Well... Go read about that yourself, it's called "the western betrayal". So Poland is well aware, historically, that it can only really rely on itself.
