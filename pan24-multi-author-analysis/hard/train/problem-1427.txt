I wonder if it goes all the way back to his childhood and teen years in apartheid-era South Africa. You wonder if his dad supported the racist policies of that time. Surely a lot of the white people he grew up around probably did and he might have absorbed those attitudes to an extent -- almost by 'osmosis'.
If Covid had had the very high mortality rates of something like the bubonic/pneumonic plague that wiped out about a third of the population of Europe in the 1300s and readily killed young adults and children like the Spanish flu, I suspect that even some of these right-wing 'Q' kooks would have absolutely embraced lockdowns, masks and vaccines. A lot of people shrugged the pandemic off because the vast majority of deaths were among 'old people who were about ready to die anyways'.
All throughout the pandemic, they wouldn't shut up about how covid deaths were being exaggerated and that there were no actual excess deaths and so on.
Even better is that if you accept the number of deaths attributed to covid, which right-wing nutjobs insist are grossly overinflated, the total death count is still only 1.09 million, not multiple millions.
"The millions of people is alluding to the QAnon conspiracy theory that the vaccines will cause millions".
The millions of people is alluding to the QAnon conspiracy theory that the vaccines will cause millions upon millions of deaths. Quite a few of your alt of alt right types believe that it is already happening despite evidence that the vaccines are extremely safe. Like you said we’ve seen over 1 million surplus deaths in the US since the start of the pandemic and there’s no other significant contributor to those deaths. There is a sizable subset of Americans who are just waiting and or even hopeful for millions upon millions of vaccinated people to die because they don’t want to be wrong.
