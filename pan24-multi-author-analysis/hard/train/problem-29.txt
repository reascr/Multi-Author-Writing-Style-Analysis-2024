I'd guess not too long if illnesses were sort of common. Making fire may have been a little difficult when they first figured out cooking food.
I would guess it's very likely they did, but the primary motivation was that it tasted better and smelled better.
It could be that it was safer, so we did it, and then developed the appreciation for the aroma, but I'm not sure there was enough time for that. So, I think somehow cooked food was naturally more appealing.
Which is kind of odd. The other way would kind of make better sense. However, other animals I think also really appreciate the smell of cooked food.
It would be likely that people found animals in an area that had burned and tried to eat them and liked them. It would not be a stretch to assume they would then look to try to duplicate that.
That’s a bit of a stretch. Some of his stuff is a little bit out there. But, the more we learn and find the more right he seems to be. He’s not perfect but I’ll never understand all the hate the guy gets.
