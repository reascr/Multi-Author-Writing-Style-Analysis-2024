I'd bet the timing of all this was driven by the Biden admin thinking it's very likely that Trump gets charges over the docs, saying 'we know classified docs in general is a messy, imperfect process so we should get our own ducks in a row.'.
So I'd say, the one real issue is if Biden's camp knew about them and did nothing in like 2021. People crying that Biden and/or the DOJ didn't disclose this just days before the midterms are grasping at straws.
Was thinking earlier today how funny it would be if Obama issued a statement saying "I declassified the Biden docs with my mind in 2016.".
Yup. Also, let's not forget Trump sued to try to get the documents returned, claimed they were his property, said he can declassify documents just by thinking about it, etc.
Maybe if Trump hadn’t willfully kept them, lied about the having them, and fucked the National Archives around for 18 months, he wouldn’t have got raided by the FBI. Biden finds document, hands it in within a day. Seems pretty different to me.
