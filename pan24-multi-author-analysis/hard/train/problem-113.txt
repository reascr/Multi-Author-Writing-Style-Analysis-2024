Which part of your comment or the one you’re responding to is factually wrong, though? High employment and raises will lead to more inflation. This is basically the Fed’s dual mandate.
Okay, you’re a company and you raise your prices 20%, purely out of greed. Oh shit, prices have gone up because of greed.
It's greed. During the pandemic everyone rose their prices citing 101 reason. Many services went up by 50% and more and don't get me started on groceries.
Seriously! When banks give interest free loans (creating money from thin air) to the Rich so they can buy more stocks and a new Yacht It's ok, but It's bad if workers get some of that money.
It’s defo a ‘goody people will be desperate to work for less and our profits will go up because we don’t have to pay those pesky wages’ short term thinking and then long term people stop spending and lose their houses and bank loans don’t get paid and the economy tanks. But then disaster capitalists buy it all up cheap.
When corporations are in trouble in stock market they fire a bunch of employees and to see a spike and not scare their investors. Yet they never cut ceo bonus’s or pay. They found a way to make money at the expense of people trying to work to survive and pay for their private yacht still.
