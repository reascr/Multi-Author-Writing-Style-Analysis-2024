Not 100% sure if the reports of people wanting to leave and not being allowed to are verified, but that’s become a common theme in his rallies: people get bored and want to leave. And who could blame them? He’s been giving essentially the exact same speech since early 2015 for God’s sake — it’s old and it’s boring even for many Republicans. Stranger things have happened, and I never say never, but I gotta agree with you about Independents: I cannot see those voters watching another 2 years of the Trump show and opting for it en masse, particularly if the midterms are any indication.
My point: I think Trump has proven that he cannot win another election because he has solidified his voter base (the crazies) and the barrier to entry to become a new trump-advocate is a line few voters would cross. No regular Joe’s (independents, centralists) realistically want insanity in geopolitics, stock markets, oppression over individual rights, or more blatant corporate greed. Trump offers people nothing. He has no plans to progress the US forward. He offers no assurance around improving healthcare, his Covid response did more harm than good, and he led an insurrection against our capitol just to name a few!
Republicans, if you’re reading this, please put up DeSantis if you want to stand a reasonable chance of winning the 2024 presidential election. Otherwise Biden will overwhelmingly win over Trump or any other MAGA-associated advocate (rightfully so!).
Yup. It's Trump's cult. I don't think they understand what that means. Cult leaders don't admit fault, they assign blame. Those who attempt to abandon the cult are threatened. Cult leaders don't surrender power peacefully, they go scorched earth and take their devout followers with them.
