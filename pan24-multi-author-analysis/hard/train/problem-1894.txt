Not even taking into account the US. It would be pointless. All China has is the perception they COULD invade.
There is nothing to be gained from invading Taiwain. Taiwan can render their own resources useless and China has to cross that pesky water to invade.
Also Taiwan‘s geographic position makes it pretty hard for China to control shipping lanes or enter open ocean if war ever breaks out. China doesn't have the luxuries the US does in terms of geography. Long term if China wants security it needs a China aligned Taiwan or a puppet state.
China will bode its time on Taiwan. It will be cheaper to buy them off in the future than to storm the island and draw international condemnation.
They don’t particularly like the greater cohesion in the west and the opportunity to wargame against a numerous but less capable enemy. What Russia is doing would be Chinas military approach to any landed neighbors so the world is seeing in real time how to fight these rigid, large armies.
China is absolutely supporting Nk selling to Russia. It pulls some of the arms off their borders, they get shipping money and less cost to prop up, and they get to sell replacements!
