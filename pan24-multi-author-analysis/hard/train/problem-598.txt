Yeah, really? And what were the Dutch Indies doing? Who was it ruled by? You know the one that ended just less than 60 years back?
That was 150 - 160 years ago. That’s like 7 or 8 generations after the fact. Maybe we need to stop dredging up the past and instead focus on what can be done today to eliminate systemic poverty, regardless of race.
Context is extremely necessary/important in order to solve the issues of systemic poverty etc issues that affect the black community to this day.
Our Grandparents today experienced the systemic racism of Jim Crow. So yes it’s important for people to understand the full context.
150 years is just a blink of an eye there are people alive today who have grandparents who were enslaved.
To add onto that the Dutch created canals to specifically to displace native Indonesians from clean water and this system is still set in places in the infrastructure to this day.
Even with context provided, a lot of people say the reason why black people are in this economic situation today is because they are “thugs, moochers, lazy uneducated individuals” u see where I’m coming from.
