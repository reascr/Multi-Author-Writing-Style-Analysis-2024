You're spot on. In recent years, the US sold out their Kurdish allies and left its NATO and Afghan allies in chaos with the manner of its withdrawal in Afghanistan.
Transactional military actions have been a staple of American politics since the Korean War, lofty rhetoric and public diplomacy notwithstanding.
Part of the reason why the Afghan War wasn't able to be painted as a war against Islam is because Turkey was a critical partner in Afghanistan even if they didn't take part in combat operations.
The US was never expecting the rough terrains of Afghanistan, or Vietnam for that matter, and Korea didn't really have a winner regardless so that one is irrelevant. Look at Finland, however, who literally only trains their military to defeat Russia in the event of invasion. Their past proves they aren't easy to take them down.
I mean, I never said it wasn't better that they are or aren't in NATO, what I'm saying is that Russia in their current status wouldn't be able to stand a chance against the Finns.
If Russia can't succeed in their 3 day "operation" on Ukraine, they're definitely not gonna take down a military specifically designed to counter them. (Finland).
