You should probably use your best stuff so that you can win rather than plan for an unexpected offensive in the second year of the war.
For Russia, we do see that they are not really using much of their best/most expensive airplanes and helicopters but that is probably because losing them would hurt too much.
My take is, Russia killed a lot of UA early in the war before the funding and then UA with drones and actual gear and attrition decimated the Russian army. Which is very impressive because everyone thought russia would just roll them over.
Syria and the second Chechen war are examples of Russian wars of attrition in modern time. In both these conflicts the enemy had collaborators within to help Russians win. What they lack right now is a significant 5th column in Ukrainian upper command. The people Russia paid off to be collaborators in the government have been either snuffed out or ran away. But If UA armed forces fracture this will be the biggest win for Russia because they could come to an agreement with one side and eliminate the other. Thus Legitimizing the win and winning over the population by saying “see it was Ukrainians who ousted their illegitimate leader”.
Russia has a new general. Hes much more competent than the previous one and hes more defensive minded and his plan seems to be to drag this into a long one. This war needs to end soon for Ukraine to have a stable future(Thats why U.S was/is publicly urging for Ukraine to broker a peace with the invaders) but the longer this drags on the better it is for Russia for numerous reasons.
