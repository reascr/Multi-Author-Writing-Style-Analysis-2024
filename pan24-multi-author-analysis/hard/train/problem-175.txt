I think it extends to a lot of high level politicians. As overblown as the Clinton Email scandal was, there was an element of truth to the claim that it was mishandled classified information that should have been more properly handled. Obviously this should never be equated to the willful hiding and possible sale of classified information, but eventually if high level politicians keep mishandling info, something important will leak.
Maybe, but the entire history of conviction for mishandling sensitive information is basically only people who found out they had sensitive info when/where they shouldn’t have and trying to cover it up. That’s not excusing Biden having these documents, but it is a very real distinction between the two situations.
Or… it was a political stunt and presidents and ex presidents frequently are in possession of classified documents as displayed very clearly by Biden having them.
Obviously our presidents and vice presidents are not handling top secret documents carefully enough. Both of the situations with Trump and Biden exposed TS documents to risks that should not be acceptable.
Some sort of investigation needs to take place and something needs to be done to tighten up control of documents.
