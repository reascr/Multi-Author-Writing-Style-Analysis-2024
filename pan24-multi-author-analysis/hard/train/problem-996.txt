Not counting any days off I take for PTO and Mandatory Saturdays in my manufacturing environment I’m lucky to have 3 days off a month.
If the job was THAT horrible people wouldn’t sign up to do it, but alas “working” only half the year is pretty appealing until you see the paycheck?
Frankly, saying that we should pay them shit because they aren't doing a good job is a feedback loop of idiocy perpetrated by the idiots who would suggest such a thing.
If the pay is shit, the only people doing the job are people who aren't good enough at other things.
Competitive pay means competitive applicants. If you want good teachers, you gotta make it an attractive job.
I’m in my third year of teaching and I don’t think the pay is too bad. However I’m still striking because the workload is fucking horrendous. I start working at around 6am and I’m still at it by 9pm, too many non-teaching staff not doing their job makes my job 20% teaching and 80% split between counselling, parenting, and sometimes security-guarding 30+ kids at a time. I don’t know what’ll fix it but something has to change. I’ve had countless mental breakdowns and I know I’m not alone.
