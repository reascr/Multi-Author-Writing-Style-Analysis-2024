So tell me, how can Ukraine or the West unilaterally declare peace when Russia doesn't want peace and has annexed 5 sizeable regions of Ukraine as its own?
It wants to rebuild the Russian empire and Ukraine is one of many countries in its path of military annihilation towards that. The only way towards peace is physically stopping Russia.
More importantly, you can't act like the invasion is the only obstacle to a lasting peace in Ukraine. How about the majority ethnic Russian Crimea on one hand, and Ukraine aiming to be an ethnostate, suppressing other languages and cultures? What if many Crimeans don't want to be part of Ukraine?
And it seems like many people want him to "promote peace" by arming Ukraine. No, that's not how you promote peace.
So what you're saying makes sense only if you make any trade with Russia as intentional support for everything Russia is doing but don't apply this to the US for some reason. This angle surely didn't arise during America's wars. And it's largely the American empire that's behind the sanctions on the Russian economy in the first place. So they don't amount to "neutrality".
Neutrality is not the enlightened position you all think it is. Shams on Brazil for blaming Ukraine.
