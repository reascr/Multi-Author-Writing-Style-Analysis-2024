Guy was just looking for an excuse to reinstate Trump, so he "conducted a poll", exactly how many Russians responded yes to that poll?
I don't know what's worse, this or the fact that Elon Musk thinks Twitter polls are representative of reality.
Attention seeking people like Musk and Trump have been promoting themselves on Twitter for years, nothing really changes with Musk owning it.
Musk wants to make money from twitter. Trump is an outage our voice that drives participation in twitter. As long as people continue to glorify trump… both through admiration and hate…. Twitter will let trump, and people like trump, rule the platform.
The cold shoulder Donald Trump gave Elon Musk regarding his Twitter account was epic, though. Yet Elon Musk decided to ignore restoring Alex Jones. I'm not really considering whether he's trying to appeal to a new fan base anymore, it just seems more and more obvious that he's just wants to use Twitter as an extension of his ego and a way to get authority. He's like the ultimate form of a power mod.
