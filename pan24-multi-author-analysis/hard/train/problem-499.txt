Really? So when the government tells a hospital that, for example, a surgeon is required by law to wear a surgical gown and mask at all times when they are in the OR with a patient, you fully oppose that?
Are you seriously comparing requiring surgeons to wear surgical equipment to the government deciding that everyone should be required to wear suits or they get fired?
No, it's the US. Indian employees who returned back home or were never in the US to begin with had to present vaccination certificates or get suspended. Vaccines weren't available for the most part, so most either came back to get vaccinated and then went back or risked getting suspended (which quite a few did).
I had colleagues who lived abroad (specifically India) get suspended because they weren't vaccinated. There were no fucking vaccines in their countries for their age group, and even if there were, why the hell were remote workers required to be vaccinated?
youre the one whos comparing getting vaccinated to wearing suits, and now you play dumb as if the other dude is the one doing an unfair comparison, please stop.
