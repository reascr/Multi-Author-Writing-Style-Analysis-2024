Like 1 post from the democratic party would go in depth about a policy and then the other party (red) would have a fkin picture of bidens face edited with horns or something.
I remember studying political communication and analyzing DNC and RNC social media channels for part of my master’s degree and tbh the way the GOP/RNC or whoever the f makes their terrible ads or posts to communicate to their base is simply egregious and irresponsible.
I got a similar solicitation at some point, ostensibly from the DCCC or some Democratic group, and I decided to rip into them and basically say “what idiot decided to use this messaging? this is the shit Republicans send to scare boomers into giving them money”.
So, I'm sure all the goppers sending out these sorts of "give me money or we're all dooooomed Doomed, I say" pitches probably think they're super smart experts at politics. The sad thing is that they will find people, GOP die hards, brains addled by years of Trumpism, who are willing to send them money.
