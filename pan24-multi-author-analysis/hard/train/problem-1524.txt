They actually do. They need to aquire the guns through legal means first. And as a reichsbürger, the law has their eyes on them.
Just go to all the marksmen guilds and you find half of them. Most reichsbürger are just members, so they can aquire a gun in case they have "to go to war against the country" or until terrorists are taking over while germany denies them their right to defend themselves or something like that.
The German government does not want armed domestic terrorists taking over the place/ attempting a coup (afraid is a very polarizing word in this context, please refrain from using it)? Something that armed citizens would not be able to defend against? Fear is the wrong word, it’s caution, since they have proof of a planned coup from a far-right extremist group using legally acquired weapons. Why shouldn’t they make it more difficult to acquire a gun, especially for extremists that are likely to misuse them?
Acquiring illegal guns is always a possibility, but that doesn't mean it's not useful to prevent them from acquiring them legally as well.
Lots of people in the far-right or Reichsbürger scene have access to weapons due to being part of shooting clubs. Increase the vetting of people with suspected extremist ties who want to acquire (or hold) a license, even if they aren't considered Gefährder (people capable and likely to carry out attacks). Impacts only a minuscule part of the population (gun ownership is already extremely rare and of that's only a small part), but can help save lives. Acquiring guns on the black market always has a high risk of being scammed or falling for a honeypot.
