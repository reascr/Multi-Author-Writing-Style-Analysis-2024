Crowds of people are huddled together for up to hours at a time - any people who are actually infected will obviously spread it.
However, the conditions at these camps are terrible and allegedly people are almost picked at random by local government to fill them up just to satisfy quotas and mandates coming down from the central government.
The problem with the zero Covid policy is that is operates under the idea of a dictated reality: the central government says that Covid isn't endemic in China, therefore it isn't and can't be. The various local governments just don't do testing until they're forced to by case loads that they can't hide, and they blame people coming from other provinces, or , or just . Then they just do a few harsh and indiscriminate lockdowns for a while and juke the stats so it looks like it worked and everything is okay again. Then repeat that same song and dance all over China.
Then you have China. Physically locking people into their homes among other crazy things in a futile effort for zero COVID, especially with the current vaccination and variant situation, is much more about control than it is about health.
