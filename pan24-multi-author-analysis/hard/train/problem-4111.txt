You can't draw an equivalence between the soviet era tanks that have been sitting outside for 40-50 years and the modern, well maintained Leopards.
And it's not like the russians being put in the tanks will get better training than the new Ukranian tankers either.
It's starting to be used to differentiate from Soviet era tanks, and the heavier western tanks, who, it's been argued can/might be able to take a few large rounds to the turret from the front. It's generally believed that any western tank will go through the front of all the soviet era tanks. Also separates them from all the light stuff/Bradley's being sent. Yes, its still MBT's, but if you are committed to maneuver warfare, you should have a spearhead of "heavy" western tanks, nowadays.
It’s not an unfitting descriptor to call an Abrams a heavy tank in comparison to Russian T72s which are also considered an MBT.
They filled the one of the roles that third gen MBTs fill now. The MBTs today weigh more than most heavy tanks and they have better guns.
It also has a lot to do with who you’re fighting. Turkey and Indonesia are basically quelling start up rebellions and tribal conflicts with groups that aren’t fielding tanks. So this thing can take a 30mm round and kill anything that fires it while not sucking down huge sums of fuel.
