Yep. Even Mike Pence (very right-wing) was worried on Jan. 6th that some of the members of his SS detail would abduct him so that the coup could work.
Even Pence didn't trust the secret service on Jan 6 when they were trying to force him in the car so the coup could succeed. Why would they delete and erase all of their phone records from Jan 6 AFTER the logs were requested. Sorry but there's no way that isn't some of the most sketchy sounding shit that absolutely deserves scrutiny and judgement.
the secret service is largely made up of former law enforcement who generally align to the right. Combine that with the mass deletion of secret service texts in regards to Jan 6, the secret service is not exactly the most reliable people.
Mike Pence didn't even trust them on Jan 6 to essentially kidnap him and prevent him from certifying the election results but you think it's nonsense that people are questioning the secret service after they erased all their texts related to Jan 6 AFTER they were requested to hand over that information? No one who is innocent doing nothing wrong intentionally destroys evidence when being investigated.
