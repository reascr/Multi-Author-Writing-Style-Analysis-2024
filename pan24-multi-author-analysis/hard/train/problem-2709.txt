I never got that, but I have met many southerners who are still rock, flag, and eagle. Still have talked to others who have the other opinion and blame the democrats (ironically since Dems where the popular ones there until like the 50s).
Well said, it was a rough campaign to legitimize northern control while hurting the southern economy. Like I feel bad but I also kinda don’t as a means to an ends. Tough spot to find yourself in.
No I get that but they still rebelled against the Union so I have little sympathy for them especially with the south’s willingness to build monuments to those who rebelled against the Union. Their monuments belong in a museum but other than that I don’t support their exoneration on state sponsored land. You lost, get over it and accept your spot in American history. We all have a lot to learn from history, especially the wrong sides of it so we can move forward.
Americans don't know their own history, which is partly why the polarize so hard. There's not an objective look at the good and the bad the country has done in the context of the time it was done in.
What made Patton right wasn't a war plan on the soviets, what made him right was the realization that the soviets were not content with the outcome of yalta and would have driven their army right over west Germany and France the moment the Americans left if not for nukes.
