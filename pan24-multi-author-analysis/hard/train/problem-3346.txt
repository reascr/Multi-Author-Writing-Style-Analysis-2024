Also, what did they do with the federal funding they get for immigration? Lets have a look at where that went shall we.
Yes, they are. They are 'undocumented', the fact that they seek documentation through proper channels does not make them legal immigrants. There exists no special exemption for 'asylum seekers' and transporting them across state lines is, indeed, a federal crime.
This isn't "falling for spin", it's a response to you saying that transporting them across state lines is a crime because they're "illegal aliens". They weren't. They are asylum seekers waiting on a hearing to determine whether they will be granted asylum, and are protected by law from deportation. They get documentation saying that they are in the asylum process and they're allowed to travel freely throughout the United States. I think what DeSantis did was abhorrent and very possibly illegal but calling asylum seekers "illegal aliens" is just factually incorrect. They're not undocumented either, because they literally have documentation from the United States saying "this person is currently in the process of seeking asylum and is allowed to be here".
This is not about my "feelings", it's about understanding the legal difference between someone who is currently officially in the process of seeking asylum, and someone who isn't. Literally, Texas (not the federal government, the Texas state government) buses people who are pending asylum to other states on the regular. How they entered does not matter while their asylum status is pending.
Individuals who have filed a claim for asylum in the U.S. do not have status as an immigrant, but are granted certain rights for the duration of the pendency of their application. These rights do include the freedom of movement within United States, whether on their own accord or facilitated through someone else.
