It’s sort of a natural consequence of how the UN operates in regards to Israel. They spend a lot of time and energy passing resolutions condemning Israel, far more than any other country, and for at least a few years now more than all other countries combined. You can criticize Israel and still think that’s nuts, and still understand why Israel would stop listening to the UN.
This situation is absolutely sick and if Israel truly wanted peace, they'd at the very least halt building settlements but they won't even do that.
Forget what you personally want to see… what realistic outcome could possibly be accepted for peace when the continued sentiment from many surrounding Arabs is “death to Jews and/or Israel”.
Peace will only come with a 2 state settlement that Israel has avoided talking about for decades, while the government allows illegal Israeli nationalist settlements in the forever shrinking Palestinian state.
Resolution 181: Recommending partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, and international status for the City of Jerusalem".
