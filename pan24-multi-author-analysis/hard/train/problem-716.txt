The vote here Saturday morning came at the DNC’s winter meeting, where Biden and Vice President Harris spoke Friday to some of the party’s most active members from across the country. Biden, who has yet to officially announce his reelection plans but has said he intends to run for a second term, was greeted by cheers of “four more years” as he took the stage.
Saturday’s voice vote marked the last formal step in the DNC’s efforts to fundamental overhaul the nominating calendar, as the committee’s members officially approved the new order set by Biden. But the push to reorder the states still faces some hurdles.
The move by members of the Democratic National Committee was long expected, but it does not guarantee the calendar will ultimately be enacted as designed. In December, Biden asked DNC leaders to move up South Carolina, which sealed his comeback victory in the 2020 Democratic primary, to the first slot.

EDIT: you seem to be talking about going into Iowa” as the day of the caucus. You may not be taking into account that the first caucus/primaries are 6-8 months in the making for the candidates. Depending on the cycle and how open the field is, candidates can start showing up in the state up to a year in advance. That takes money, yes, but not nearly as much as it would take to concentrate on 12 states at once. Only the most well-established candidates would have the fundraising available to compete.
