Their reasoning was that to qualify for ballots, state law said that an initiative had to present an equal number of petition signatures from each of the state’s five congressional districts (a requirement meant to ensure that Jackson couldn’t get do a ballot initiative on its own.).
2. Jackson has been systematically neglected by the state government for generations, and have consistently shown they do not have Jackson's best interests at heart.
1. When we look at Mississippi's history, we have a whole lot of white judges intentionally suppressing the rights of black people.
Also, if you look up the history of voting in Mississippi, you’ll undoubtedly find that white people didn’t derive their power from fair voting.
No one is asking for an all black group of people to decide anything, they are saying let the district vote to appoint their own people rather than have a handful of white people decide the fate of a district that's population is predominantly black.
This is literally the only district in the state they are doing this for, removing the ability for the constituents in the district to vote for their own judges and what not, and it just so happens to be the blackest district in the city. This district would have definitely voted in different people. And if you don't realize that white people and black people have different life experiences then you are living in denial.
