Either they end up being dairy cows themselves or are perhaps selected for the meat industry or are selected to be bulls for breeding future dairy cows.
In such cases milk based products don't seem to be so bad at all. Maybe a better goal than forcing everyone down the vegan path would be to back ethical farming procedures and methods.
Ok. Locally-sourced dairy, eggs, and fish; 90% plant based diet; policies to reduce waste; and the inevitable waste they do have is fed to hogs that are raised for a once-a-semester hog roast.
Nothing in the article discussed the morality of animal-based products in and of themselves, only their ecological effect. Whether or not you think it's fundamentally immoral for omnivores to eat animals has no bearing on the policies at hand.
Less than 1% voter turnout is certainly not a good situation, but if it was voluntary on the part of that 99%, it does become a "lie in your own bed" kind of situation. Most "student" decisions like this will always be made by the small minority of students who care enough to attend meetings.
