It's why I've got trouble saying Cheeto Hate-ler doesn't know anything. He's "perfect"-ly good at doing bad things. And under oWn TeH LiBz rules, I guess you've always gotta be looking out for things that might trip up a future corrupt and/or evil Republican monarch.
Heard somewhere that some Republican'ts are grumbling about Democrats not helping them out. My thought is, sure...why not go out of the way to help out a louse like Qevin, who before this nonsense, already gave the worst 9.1% of his caucus a promise that they could totally launch sham investigations and hold show trials for any Democrat in government and any one that simply agrees with them? Let 'em humiliate themselves and cry that nobody bailed them out...which will no doubt wind up sounding a lot like, "Democrats stopped 'the people's' business from being done!".
What would they say? "He's kind of old, and very white. Come on and just vote for him so we can move on to the important business of blaming the Libs for all the problems.".
