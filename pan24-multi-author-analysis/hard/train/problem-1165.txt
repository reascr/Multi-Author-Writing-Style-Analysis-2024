not really. the use of nukes wouldn't be to win a war. it will be to make sure the enemy loses. I'm sure if your nukes wipes out 98+% of the enemy civilian population, the enemy military will probably start questioning whether it was worth the fight.
but nukes almost guarantee you're going to also kill your targets (see: a hypothetical scenario where you need to kill everyone in your enemy's country, or try) unlike gravity bombs or conventional warheads.
just wanted to say that nukes are used instead of conventional warheads - the point of MAD is to never get to the tipping point, however close you may get.
there's that cycle of armament and disarmament of which we've mostly seen one high and one starting low and another low now.
it's to supposedly be good at something you hope you'll never have to do because it's a damn good way of signing your own death certificate.
so it's better from a logistical perspective to use small medium range nukes along with gliders and the like than risk failing by having your planes fail to deliver your bombs.
