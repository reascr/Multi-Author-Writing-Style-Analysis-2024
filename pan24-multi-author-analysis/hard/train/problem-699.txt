1 company even sends a huge generator so they can light the christmas tree in Kyiv so they don't have to use local electricity.
Aleksandr Lukashenko, the self-proclaimed president of the Republic of Belarus, has said that the idea that the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) might dissolve if Russia loses the war in Ukraine is growing increasingly popular.
Sucks! you and your family had to experience this. I just watched the news here and they spend about 20 minutes on Ukraine, companies here (and tons of donations from Poland) are sending so many generators to Ukraine the next week it's insane (talking high end stuff).
This really gives me the vibes of those posts from ASWmilitary news or whatever they were with shit like "1 hour, 48 minutes, the entirety of the Ukrainian military is destroyed" and other nonsense.
This is Russia were talking about, their military forces are so shit what Ukraine is fighting might as well be ISIS with an airforce. There's no negotiating with stupidity of this calibre these bastards only learn by being beaten into the ground enough times that they'll fuck off for good or get buried in said ground to make more sunflowers.
