I don’t accept the idea that there’s no way the U.S. military couldn’t intercept it and bring it down without it risking hitting people below. It’s a slow moving weather balloon. If we can pit people on the moon I’m sure there’s a way to engineer this problem.
It’s very likely not. Most likely this was just taunting America and the fact they let it hang around for a few days projects weakness that we know a nation like China would not reciprocate if the same thing happened on their soil.
If it's only purpose was to taunt the US, then not shooting it down but still acknowledging its existence is America saying "oh, that's cute China, be sure to try harder next time".
Let's say we did shoot it out of the sky? That would give away tracking methods and response time. Plus the Chinese government would have ammo to say that the USA is scared of an obvious weather balloon.
It also shows how weak China is because it tells the world that they are relying on a balloon to do their spy work.
In the age of advanced satellite imaging and classified technologies for spying purposes, it’s laughable that everyone is making a big deal out of a Chinese balloon.
You'd think with all the republicans believing the China released covid on purpose, that they would be wary of an overly obvious balloon that's begging to be shot down. Great way to make your enemy release a bioweapon in their own country.
