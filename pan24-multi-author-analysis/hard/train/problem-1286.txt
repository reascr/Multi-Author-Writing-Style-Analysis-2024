In places like vancouver and Toronto they absolutely do rent them. There’s that thing called property managers, they’re not doing it themselves. Vancouver has an empty home tax as well.
So right now, Canada is not paying people enough to afford to buy homes and in many cases to even rent homes. For instance, I lucked out buying this condo in 2016 and if i had to buy it as it is valued today at today's rate the mortgage would go from $765 a month to $3600/month. Do you have an extra $3000 laying around? I sure as shit don't. I consider myself VERY fortunate.
Simultaneously, they're suppressing wages by inviting half a million immigrants a year because 'noone wants to work' because they literally cannot afford to move to the cities to take up jobs. That's 1.3% of Canada's current population a year.
EDIT: For my math, my mortgage is for $150K at the moment, down from $205K at close. It's at 1.64%. The value of the property according to BC Assessment is now around $525,000 and I can't even dispute that because last year a lesser unit sold for more. The current mortgage rate is 6.3%. Of course I have equity now in this place, but if i had been renting since 2016 I never would have been able to make this work buying this place now. I wouldn't even qualify for this mortgage.
