We need all of the states to join the lawsuit against them. There is a term for that, I just don't remember it. But anyway, fuck these piece of shit pharmaceutical companies, especially when the guy who CREATED INSULIN decided to give it away for free so that MANKIND COULD BENEFIT FROM IT.
THESE FUCKING ELITE GREEDY PIECES OF SHIT have destroyed and killed thousands of people and it should be illegal, with jail time and fines.
HOWEVER, just like the energy companies, just like wall street, the healthcare industry is "ToO bIg To JaIl" so, probably won't happen.
I hope it isnâ€™t going to result in these companies exiting the market, which is also possible. The State of California could create dispensaries to eliminate the pharmacy benefit manager middlemen like how Walmart did it with their ReliOn Insulin. Their ReliOn Novolog is about 75% less than branded Novolog while being biosimilar. It is still likely profitable for Walmart but the state can potentially charge less to only markup to cover overhead.
