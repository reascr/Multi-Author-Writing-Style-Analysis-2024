Well they didn’t have too deal with that before. I have a friend who has lived in the UK for 20+ years and never got her citizenship until Brexit happened. Why deal with the process as an EU citizen you didn’t need to.
But they didn't because "hey, we are in the EU, I don't need to become a citizen of this country". Not very smart.
Edit: Imagine if all those living in the UK for so many years had been able to vote in the Brexit referendum, or in the following general elections.
If you voted remain, the obvious first step after the referendum is looking into gaining permanent residence in the EU, because you'd likely be hyper aware of that particular downside to Brexit. And you'd continue to pay attention to politics to find out when you'd have to apply, because you couldn't really apply for permanent residency as a UK citizen when the UK was still an EU member.
I think it works for EU offshore oilrig workers as well. There are some oddities with offshore oilrigs as the workers lives on the rigs while they are working.
