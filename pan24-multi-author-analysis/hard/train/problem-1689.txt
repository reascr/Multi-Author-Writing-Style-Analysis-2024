Ukraine is taking significant loses. They are taking the same amount of military loses as Russia plus civilian according to US estimates. Our news is only highlighting Russian loses as a morale booster and because that is what people want to hear. This has been pretty 50/50 though.
Oh it’s nowhere close to 50/50. It’s not 99/1 like Reddit makes it seem but it’s nowhere close to 50/50. The reason Ukraine isn’t advancing is not because they’re taking super heavy casualties. It’s because Russia is successfully throwing meat shields in their way and Ukraine is unwilling to show a similar disregard for their soldier’s lives in order to advance.
Where have you seen confirmed killed higher? BTW confirmed killed is always lower than the actual number killed because confirming deaths and reporting them takes time and resources.
You’re including wounded in the “casualty” number. Russia has seen more than 20,000 soldiers confirmed killed. Ukraine has seen about 10,000. And the trend for Ukraine is stable. The trend for Russia is ever increasing.
