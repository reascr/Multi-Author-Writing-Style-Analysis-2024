>The Grand Jury heard extensive testimony on the subject of alleged election fraud from poll workers, investigators, technical experts, and State of Georgia employees and officials, as well as from persons still claiming that such fraud took place. We find by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.
This report is from a grand jury on a massive racketeering investigation into Trump and crew for their attempts to influence/overturn the election in Georgia. It includes the "find me 11,780 votes" phone call, other similar phone calls, false statements made to the Georgia legislature, intimidation of election workers, and the fake elector scheme.
Even more than perjury, I’m thinking recorded conversations amongst officials and the fake electors and stuff, especially if they cut a deal with any of the fake electors to flip.
I’m guessing a lot of the perjury charges are going to go to the people on the witness stand for Trump who keep insisting that the election was stolen in order to aid and abet the 2020 coup attempt.
The fact that the grand jury so unequivocally asserts there was no election fraud is a pretty strong signal that they have likely recommended indictment of Trump. It means they have established, through a thorough review of the evidence, that everything he and his cronies did in Georgia was based on a lie.
