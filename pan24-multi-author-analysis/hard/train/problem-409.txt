it's incredibly easy to get, yes. your ssn is probably floating around for sale by half a dozen data brokers. and that's only the semi-legitimate data brokers.
i'm not in georgia, but we should probably go vote by mail as the standard. too bad republicans are idiots.
You are using the same logic as Republicans are using with voter fraud. You’ve got a feeling that’s it true. It must be true. Just because we can’t find any doesn’t make it not true.
Show me proof that the more people vote the more democrats win. That’s another myth everyone says is true but can’t point to any evidence. I like how you put legal in parentheses because I can point to half the population that would disagree with that.
True but the only disadvantage is longer lines. That is a disadvantage but it’s not changing elections if they can’t find a single person who was unable to vote.
Then why is it that the less strict voting laws/regulations are, the more people (legally) vote? And is it just a coincidence that the more people that vote, the more Democrats win? How do you explain those two things without voter suppression?
Voter fraud on the right and voter suppression, not voter inconvenience, on the left are both myths. Both sides say it’s massive, pervasive, and a threat to democracy but neither can actual find any evidence.
