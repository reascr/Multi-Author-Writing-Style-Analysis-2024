No, not exactly, but they still can’t cancel student loans and this applies to everyone in the country. They’ll have to appeal it to the 5 circuit, and if the 5th circuit rules in favor of the plaintiffs then it can be appealed to SCOTUS. It’ll only be dead if SCOTUS rules in favor of the plaintiffs, that’s what makes this whole scenario worrying.
That seems pretty likely, unless either the 5th Circuit or SCOTUS throw out the ruling because its analysis was highly flawed...
Agreed, it will take longer, but the ruling is nonsense and even the fith circuit is unlikely to support the ruling, sense the cancellation is authorized in statute.
Hopefully it's overturned on appeal, his ruling is nonsense, Congress authorized the program through the heroes act, it would be different if they used a loophole, by having the Treasury cancel the debt.
And since the payment pause is universal it's harder to justify politically, plenty of 6 figure folks benefit from the pause.
I think the bigger problem with a extended pause is the revenue hit, I would expect a GOP house to cut funding to social services until payment are restarted.
