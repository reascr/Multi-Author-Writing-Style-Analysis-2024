I think the Republican house won’t have enough votes to impeach Biden, luckily. The moderates who won their elections in Dem areas aren’t about to do something that stupid, and the Republican only have a 4 seat majority.
You have to give financial disclosures (not amounts, just who pays you) when you speak at a scientific conference. The fact that a president shouldn’t have to do the same is just crazy.
Bush Jr was pretty quiet all things considered. Should have been investigated for many different things, but did not happen.
A lot of Republican actions can be seen as seeking revenge for Nixon. They had to get back at the Dems and have the Dems be soiled by having a President resign or be removed from office.
Anyways, now the Repubs have a twice impeached President, and a President that’s been forced to resign, they still need to get back at the Dems. They will try everything and anything to impeach Biden or the next Dem President. The Hunter Biden “story” is just a cover to get Biden impeached.
Every time I hear a Hunter Biden story, number go up. This week is heard “Hunter made literally hundred of millions in illegal money, with 10% for the big guy!”.
