The mental gymnastics needed to believe that are astonishing, and then gaslighting us all by pretending we’re the ones who interpreted his statement the wrong way.
The justification I’m seeing from Trump supporters is that he “meant” to say that the fraud is what is terminating the constitution, not that he wants to.
He is literally saying that this “fraud” doesn’t immediately terminate the clauses of the constitution but rather that it justifies doing so.
Edit: Even if we were to give the benefit of the doubt and believe that he was misunderstood (saying that allowing the "fraud" essentially terminates the constitution) the rest of his post/defense shows he has no respect for the Constitution.
The Constitution is clear, there are no constitutionally valid "steps" that can be taken to "right the wrong". Holding a new election or declaring the "rightful winner" (which we can all assume he means himself) would be examples of terminating the rules, regulations, and articles of the Constitution (specifically Article 2 Clauses 2,3, and 4).
