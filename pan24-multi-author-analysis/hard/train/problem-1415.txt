As I understand it, the past week Russia has been stepping up it's offensives on Ukraine's defensive lines with their expendable new recruits. The goal seems to be to make one or more breakthroughs to force Ukraine to have to commit its reserves to stabilise their front line. Russia would then start their major offensive further north while much of the Ukrainian reserves are tied up and unable to respond effectively. So far it doesn't seem to be working as Ukrainian defensive lines have held, or they are being smart and withdrawing to more effective defensive positions.
If Ukraine sets good defensive positions, fallback lines, and detailed plans don't think this russian offensive will manage a full breakthrough. The most important thing is anti tank weaponry. Javelins, NLAWs, Stugnas, RPGs, etc. Losing 15 tanks a days sums up 1800 tanks in 4 months. And it may well be a conservative number for a big offensive.
It's the expected outcome. Ukraine had time to lay down mines, and stock anti tank weapons in the region. I really hope russia fully commits to this offensive and gets utterly defeated so Ukraine can counterattack later with way weaker defenses.
Probably what we are going to see over the next month or two is Russia continuing to make small gains with massively lopsided casualty rates and then Ukraine smashing them back when Russian forces are depleted.
This suggests that Russian losses were exactly as devastating as the battlefield videos showed, and that the vaunted "elite" Naval Infantry was completely destroyed within just a few short days.
[Edit] Inexplicably Russians have released a video of their Naval Infantry staging for their final attack. Many of the vehicles in the video are the exact ones later seen destroyed in the Ukrainian video:
