Dogs, cats, rabbits, and monkeys are cool and all, but seriously, human lives are far more important. I don't condone the mistreatment of animals during testing, but the vast majority is done in a humane way.
No, because most people don’t give a shit about medical ethics - they care about puppies. I ain’t saying they’re right, but you won’t win people over with that argument. Anyone who cares about that already agrees with you!
I agree with you, but a lot of people have a very strong emotional attachment to dogs. Appealing to logic is all well and good, but appeals to emotion are just a more effective political tool for swaying opinion.
Sure, but ignoring the effectiveness of appeals to emotion results in the rise of populists like Trump, who \do\ appeal to the emotions of their supporters. How many times have you heard Dems called "elitist", or "out of touch"? This is in large part because they often choose to appeal to common sense and logic, rather than emotion. It's a dirty trick, and has risks like you say, but we can't ignore it as a tool.
