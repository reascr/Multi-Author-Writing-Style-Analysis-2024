On the other hand, if you want to make a deterrent against Putin trying anything, put the US president in Kyiv by surprise before Putin can whine about it, and dare him to have a go. Putin’s struggling to handle NATO hand-me-downs handed to Ukraine, he’s in no position to start a war with NATO proper by risking blowing up a US president.
It's bold, it's risky, but if Putin does nothing it shows he is still very very afraid of the US and solidifies the US's strenh.
Biden going into Kyiv is a pretty big thing; it not only demonstrates that Kyiv is safe enough for a US presidential visit but him being there literally will create an operational wall that Russia won't exactly want to engage in for fear Biden might get injured or killed.
Biden visiting is bigger I think, because the US is not only showing solidarity but swinging its diplomatic weight around knowing Russia can't or won't do anything about it.
In fact, I can totally see Russia temporarily stops any attack around where Biden is just to make sure they don't accidentally end up being in a total war with the U.S.
Edit 2: Some people have asked what would happen if Putin went full batshit insane and the unimaginable happens. The following assumes that Russia intentionally assassinates Biden.
And all of that is before a single shot is fired by the U.S. military. Whatever happens after bullets start flying is something I cannot, and do not want to speculate. I know I'll be in my makeshift bunker.
