The VP is supposed to have like 3 jobs, and one of them is just being the first in line in case the President dies.
Biden didn’t do much as VP either except make Obama look more tolerable to…certain people. That’s how it should be. Why are you comparing Kamala to the last two Republican VPs?
Compared to what the vice presidency has become she is useless. Dick Cheney & Mike Pence ran the government with Bush and Trump being the person to sign the bills.
She should be Vice President right now but the democrats were afraid she would be vulnerable to birthed attacks, instead we’re stuck with useless Kamala Harris.
And that’s the problem. The midterms have democrats feeling big for their britches thinking people will vote for Kamala no matter what but the reality is she will get creamed by Trump or Desantis. She is a zero charisma candidate like Gore Kerry and Clinton and we know what happened to them.
What does it say that I’ve nearly forgotten that she was the Democratic candidate already? That’s the charisma you’re talking about.
