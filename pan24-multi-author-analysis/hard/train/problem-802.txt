This is really the issue. The rest is just more culture war. You're either for "law and order" or you aren't. If you aren't (by virtue of your actions), then expect the law to take its course the same way it should for any American who breaks the law. It would be interesting to see conservatives being directly challenged on this more frequently, to explain why they should get a free pass when it comes to criminal behavior.
Edit: Note that these are the same people who just voted to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics.
