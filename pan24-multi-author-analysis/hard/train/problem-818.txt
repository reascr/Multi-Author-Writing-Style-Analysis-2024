Also it's not like we force the US to invest that much into the military or is the US now a German puppet state?
Honestly, pumping too much money into the army now seems like a knee jerk reaction. There is no real threat to Germany or NATO, so we should keep the spending at a reasonable level.
AFAIK, a bunch of things that are funded from Germany's defense budget are funded from other sources in France. In total they spent more on their military. I agree they make better use of their money, but an aircraft carrier tends to be costly no matter what. And both navy and air force are like 30% larger than Germany's. Add to that constant foreign engagements in Western Africa.
Seriously though, Germans are indebted to the US for protecting us from the Commies for 40 years, for making reunification possible against French and British resistance and for letting us even be a country again after WW2. Also Biden said at a recent G7 summit "he couldn't think of a closer friend and ally of the United States than Germany" - which didn't go so well with the British but put a rare smile on many faces in Berlin.
