People pair alcohol with music or sports events because it loosens them up, its paired culturally and drinking together is seen as a bonding exercise.
I don’t feel people going for coffee with their friends at 2pm really “get deep” or have much experiences together. Its all very literal conversation. Drinking in the pub with your friends at 10pm? You loosen up and have all sorts of conversations you would never dream of having with co-workers or family. I’ve yet to see this replicated in sober people.
I don’t drink 28 days out of the month, but the two days I go to the pub for a few hours I do. Would be funny if someone said to me “oh what you can’t go a few hours on a Saturday night without drinking?” like I haven’t just done it for 28 days.
I’m not into either football or drinking enough for it to affect me but it’s not really fair to say “if you can’t go a few hours without drinking”.
Tbh I'm not against banning alcohol in football grounds if the actual reason was to improve the experience for everyone, but obviously that's not what's going on here.
