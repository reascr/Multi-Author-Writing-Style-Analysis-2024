Check the median salaries, that's about 1 year's salary. If you can only pay off 2-3K a month, then that's a lifestyle choice. Country clubs aren't cheap.
Healthcare in the US costs a lot. Way more than it should. But that's not solely because of corporate profit. It's the cost structure all the way down. It's the labor. Healthcare workers in the US get paid way more than anywhere else. 9 out of the 10 top paying jobs in the US are healthcare jobs. That 1 that isn't, is the corporate CEO. That CEO job isn't on the top of that top 10 list. It's actually near the bottom.
That's a rationalization. Or more so, an excuse. Since the amount of student debt the indebted doctors had was much less than what they make in a year. So that debt should have been paid off in short order. Then what's the excuse for these debt free doctors to continue to have such extravagant salaries?
they have to pay doctors that much because of their loans, that is the only reason. again, an external factor causing economic turmoil being construed in a way that makes workers seem greedy. overall, its a no from me dawg.
