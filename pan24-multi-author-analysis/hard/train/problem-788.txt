Aeroflot's is, and there are a lot of reasons for that; Russia produces very few long-haul airliners, and the ones it does produce don't have EASA/FAA/CAA certification for passenger flights. Both of those become less of an issue in an isolated Russia.
Ultimately the Russian domestic market is dominated by regional carriers though, and while those fleets are still majority western aircraft, Sukhoi has a huge presence there, other Russian companies are starting to make an entrance to that market as well.
That's true, and I'm not saying they won't need them to some extent. But without daily flights to the major US cities and EU capitals, they can squeek by with a smaller fleet, gradually cannibalising some of their stock.
It's also worth noting that "russifying" of Russian commercial aircraft began years ago, in reaction to concern over how sanctions would effect aircraft imports, as well as joint ventures like the Superjet.
Not only are they unable to fly in countries where Russian airlines have been banned, but they're also at increased risk- and a risk that's possibly not worth it- if they fly to any country where it's theoretically possible that the Western owners could have the planes seized and repossessed by legal means.
What's interesting is that, for any planes they haven't bought from the leasing companies and where the companies want- and have the right to- demand their planes back under the original agreement, Russia is potentially even more restricted in what they can do with them.
Let's say, hypothetically, that some or all of the aircraft leased to the russia were actually returned to their proper owners. Those that have not been tempered with would still have a small chance to continue flying in proper airspace. But the ones that have been touched by the russians might as well be scrapped right now. Nobody would want to take the risk of flying aircraft with unknown modifications and put themselves underspotlight should any incidents happen.
