It's ironic since the GQP already subverted the IRS during the Trump era with the current IRS head, but I guess any form of accountability is too much.
Given that they are looking at my poverty tax bracket ass this hard while letting shit stains like trump get away with shit, I think I'm justified in saying fuck the IRS.
Typical republican: IRS cuts mean theyâ€™ll ignore me and I can shave a couple thousand off my taxes by being sneaky.
The Republicans have been butchering up the tax code for decades in order to benefit their corporate overlords so they don't have to pay much or any taxes.
And spare me the "a flat tax doesn't tax everyone fairly". Yes, it does. 10% is 10%. How much you pay is relative to how much you make. $3000 from a $30,000 salary is a lot less than $10,000 from a $100,000 salary. If they lower the tax rate to 10%, everyone will take home more money so they'll have more to spend on food, clothing, etc if they are low income earners.
We need either a consumption tax or a flat tax (somewhere around 10%), that everyone pays, no ifs ands or buts, except those under an established poverty line.
