China as a collective is getting too old to work. We've already seen the effects that has had on Japan as their birth rates plummeted. China is buckling at the seams and is going to collapse in the next decade.
What evidence do we have that China is buckling at the seams? Their economy and GDP continues to grow, inflation is extremely low. I’m not sure how the ccp is crushing the youth, I actually go to China three times a year in partnership with some of their universities and majority of the youth loves Xi, to my surprise.
The next decade is actually going to be a harsh reality for the middle and lower class in the west. The last few years of inflation and cost increases is just a precursor. Why do you think we are trying so hard to slow China down? Not sure if you are old enough to know about Japan and Americas relationship in the 70s and early 80s, this is a repeat except China won’t be dumb enough to sign the plaza accords.
Continue to cut China out of trade? Boy you are in for a surprise and dose of reality. Trade continues to increase year over year between us and China.
Trade volume between the West and China will continue to grow over the next decade. Your hope of trade being cut is wishful thinking and frankly speaking against the economic interests of the West.
The part about the West cutting China out of high tech chip production is correct. You don't have to convince me of that.
