To be clear here, McCarthy is one of the four republicans who would be a target of those ethics probes, and the investigation would have been for his refusal to cooperate with the January 6th committee.
What it means if everyone else in the GOP goes along with it and vote McCarthy for Speaker of the House while under an ethics investigation seems like he's part of the coverup.
I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for a GOP-led House to investigate an ethics violation of one of their own. They're too busy prepping the endless investigations into Hunter Biden revenge porn to care about actual ethics. Over half of the new committee chairs literally voted not to certify Biden's election win. Jim Jordan just got the chair position for the House judiciary committee. Yes, the same Jim Jordan that flagrantly refused to cooperate with the requests of another House committee. The same Jim Jordan that said the American public is tired of endless House investigations yet is prepping to open dozens once he gets his gavel. The same Jim Jordan that accused Democrats of unethically using committees as political cudgels is...you guessed it...about to do the same. Such unabashed hypocrites, the House GOP is completely amoral.
There's also misrepresentations in the House, yet again due to the discrepancy in state populations. In a perfect distribution, each member of the House would represent about 760k people. But the state populations don't neatly divide by that number. So you get situations like Delaware which has almost double the population Wyoming but both states only get 1 representative, or how Rhode Island gets 2 representatives despite only having a 7% larger population than Delaware.
The Senate is skewed by design, where Wyoming and Cali have equal representation despite one having almost 70x the population of the other.
