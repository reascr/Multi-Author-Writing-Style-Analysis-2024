Although I didn't vote for her, you have to point out that that party was the one that transformed an autocratic party into a democratic one and that helped the formation of the current republic that has always condemned dictatorial regimes. Biden's party is that of the KKK but no one says it's in their DNA.
Because fascism is a dictatorial regime in which a person came to power illegally, obtained full powers and has a monopoly on the press and the media. There is therefore only one party and it is illegal to have political opposition and a thought that is opposed to those of the dictator. There is the exaltation of war, violence and race. Although it is a far-right government, if you call it a fascist government you should open some history books.
But you have a definition of Fascism that is really far from what fascism is. In the USA you have had Trump who has been absolutely closer to Mussolini than any previous or Italian prime minister since 1946.
It is not a normal thing to say in 2023, if someone says "mussolini came to power legally" his opinion should not even be questioned in areas concerning history.
Edit: I feel the need to be clear that when I say "Mussolini took power legally" that is not a moral judgement. He and his party used violent intimidation to "persuade" voters to vote a certain way, wrote terribly biased legislation that strenhened his hold on the government, staged a coup which is obviously anti-democratic, and the list goes on. However, if all Mussolini had was a couple thousand armed followers, it is unlikely he would ever have taken power. He had the support of the majority of conservative politicians who twisted the existing law or wrote new ones to legally transfer power to Mussolini.
Mussolini took power in 1924 due to forming a coalition with several conservative parties who wrote legislation that allowed him to take power. It was not a free or fair election, but Mussolini did have national support which is how he became a dictator.
