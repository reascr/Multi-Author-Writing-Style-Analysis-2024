Don’t forget the years of negotiations the State Department invested in trying to bring Whelan home prior to this swap.
Whelan’s own brother is on record saying the following: "make the deal that was possible, rather than waiting for one that wasn’t going to happen.".
More than that... If Griner is to stand tall for a CBD vape pen, Whelan literally had Russian sensitive information on a flash drive, and admitted to it, and then blamed the wedding party he was attending.
Good question. His explanations for having it seem adhoc to me, but I can also see it being shenanigans considering how many of our former military love to do dumb shit in other countries.
I think Whelan should be home, but if consistency is a thing I would say that he deserves exactly what the hardliners say Griner deserves. Also, Griner never intentionally defrauded US service members while Whelan did. He isn't a Marine. He is a dishonorably discharged former Marine.
He got demoted, and kicked out for stealing from both the Marine Corps and fellow Marines, and even his family agrees with decisions that have been made.
Its funny because if you go to the USMC reddit there is a thread of actual Marines saying this guy is an ass clown and deserves to stay where he is.
Yep, and you have to take into account that Marines are assholes by nature. It’s a requirement and it is screened for at MEPS. So to be discharged on bad conduct means you have to be a whole other level of asshole. Not the usual “ha, this asshole is hilarious. I should buy him a drink,” but “holy shit what is wrong with this asshole?”.
