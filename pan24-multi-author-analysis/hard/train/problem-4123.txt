Isn't it more akin to outlawing racism. Of course someone who is BORN into a high caste wouldn't want caste discrimination outlawed but for someone who is BORN untouchable wouldn't want to be treated like trash.
I don't know why you would assume caste discrimination is already illegal. It's not obviously racial or ethnic as those terms are understood in the United States and I don't know what else it could possibly fall under as far as protected classes.
I wouldn't say that it's exempted, but it's so poorly understood by Americans that it really needs its own definition. Just because _you_ might understand doesn't mean the HR lawyer at Microsoft who is trying to deal with a caste discrimination case understands it or knows of legal precedent.
While I understand the sentiment and wish it could be the case, unfortunately it has been proven time and time again that people are unable to _agree not to be assholes_.
We have a very large Indian population and caste is very poorly understood by anyone who is not a part of the culture. Human resources, in specifically tech companies, often dismiss caste discrimination because they don't understand it or feel they cannot prove it in a court of law. Hopefully this law brings awareness and gives companies the confidence they can win a court case if they need to fire someone for caste discrimination.
It's not like banning dog meat or committing crimes in another language, that's a pretty ridiculous comparison. This is about further defining forms of discrimination. Those don't define discrimination, they are discrimination.
