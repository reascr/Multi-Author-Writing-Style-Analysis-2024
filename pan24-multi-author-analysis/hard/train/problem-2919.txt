to be fair it is about disentangling your economy so it gets damaged less than the guy you want to hurt with those embargoes. So alot of the song and dance makes sense to not end in a self made economic crisis that will fuck with your ability to stay the course.
Well, "give" is too strong a word. Germany repeatedly renounced any demands of the lands east of the Oder river, I think first East Germany as part of the communist block, then in 1990 West Germany with the 4+2 treaty to make reunification possible.
It was Stalin that gave those lands though, in exchange of keeping most of what he had claimed and annexed from Poland with the Molotov Ribbentropp pact already.
Also, as others mentioned here, Polandâ€™s acquisition of formerly German lands was an action that Stalin took.
On top of that, the lands were given to poland much more than poland actively taking it. It was more or less stalin's way of justifying taking a lot of former eastern Poland away from Poland.
But nothing is stopping Poland from going further on their own, they're just deflecting blame. Germany got oil from the same pipeline Poland gets this 10% from and reduced it to 0% at the start of the year, which Poland originally also said they'd do.
There is a partial embargo. No imports via sea transport, which is the bulk of imports. However there's an exception made for imports via pipeline, which was the only way to get Hungary to agree.
