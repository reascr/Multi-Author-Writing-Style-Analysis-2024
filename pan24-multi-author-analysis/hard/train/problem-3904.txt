The hotter the water going into a hydrogen electrolysis plant, the more efficient it is. For example, colocating a hydrogen generation plant with a nuclear power station allows the plant to produce power when required, and use the water/steam in the secondary cooling loop as the input to a much more efficient electrolysis process.
And as green hydrogen is only going to be produced from renewable energy, it will be produced only from excess renewable energy which would otherwise be permanently lost. So the efficiencies of the process are largely irrelevant. Basically all plans for renewables require considerable overbuilding and interconnects, and in that model there will frequently be times when we have excess power. During those times, hydrogen will be created. During times of indufficient energy, hydrogen will be consumed.
Hydrogen is a fuel that can be produced through renewable energy. Producing it like this is effectively storing energy, as you're taking excess production from renewable and making a gas that can be burned later, and the waste of burning it is water.
We already have ways of getting clean energy in the first place, and since you want to use the cheapest energy you'd naturally go for renewable when they are overproduction energy relative to the demand. There's also rules being set up for projects like this to specifically be green hydrogen, as part of the EUs energy projects.
Yeah, the "problem" is that hydrogen in this sense is acting as a battery, but it is ultimately a fuel (or replacing a fuel).
So yes; you're right that it is a battery (or rather the process of making and storing hydrogenis a battery), but I'm not sure you can't call it a fuel when it's used as a fuel to generate electricity (and it substitutes other fuels). Totally right that its not an energy source, unless you're being very pedantic and even I think that's stretching the meaning of the word.
