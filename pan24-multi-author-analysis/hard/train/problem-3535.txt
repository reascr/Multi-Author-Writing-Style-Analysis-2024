Taiwan is protecting its self by continuing to dominate the industry. America would definitely show up, and even if they didn’t other western and Asian nations are not gonna be chill with their major supplier being wiped out.
Taiwan and the company wouldn’t have signed off on this unless they had another card up their sleeve. People are also assuming the United States will be able to produce the quantities that Taiwan can and that is 100% wrong. It’ll take a long time before they are as efficient. Taiwan will continue to be relevant for a long time to not just westerners but asia as well.
Many nations want China to stay within the first island chain. They're aggressive in term of territory claims.
To be fair, Taiwan would want USA to be stronger and also the majority of their customers are USA companies.
It's a gimmick not the real size. Anything 5nm and beyond is now just a marketing term for the technology generation like 2.0 and stuff.
They started to stack transistors (3d) and stuff now so they can fit more. It's not like they shrunk it even further yet.
