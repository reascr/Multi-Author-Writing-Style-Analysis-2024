Entirely true. The Democratic party needs new leadership. Rural America doesn't even know they exist except at the national level because they don't exist out here. The ones that do run are left to fund their own campaigns with little attention given to them from the national party. Meanwhile republicans support every election little chance or not.
Except they shouldn't have 'easily won' them, the Republicans don't stand for anything positive for their voters and should have lost much worse than they did.
So they often run unopposed, or the Democrats who do run stand no real chance of winning, which depresses Democratic voter turnout, so you can't really look at aggregate partisan turnout and take any meaningful conclusions from it.
But that doesn't account for the fact there are many districts that, either through gerrymandering or just normal demographics/district drawing, that are heavily Republican.
That's why I said running unopposed, or where the Democrat doesn't really stand much chance of winning.
Democrats just will not try for any race that don't see as already in the bag, and republicans don't give a shit and they try to go for anything. In my local elections the democratic party is near extinct.
The Democratic party is in the business of staying in power with minimal effort, not winning mass elections.
The Democratic Party wins mass elections. The Democratic Party also loses with a TON more votes than Republicans. See how many more votes Hillary got than Trump. The Democratic Party is not hurting for votes, and they put in a lot more than a minimal effort. I'm sorry you feel left out.
