They won't be sending their secret stuff obviously. Something as simple as a few hundred thousand meal kits would be a massive help to Russia, not to mention rifles and artillery shells.
However I see no reason why they would not supply Russia with rockets and artillery. Russia's problem will be supplying people capable of using them. More mobilization and more conscription I suppose.
It would be a massive game changer if China starts supplying arms to Russia. Its stockpiles are effectively limitless compared to Russia's reserves. NATO are clearly supplying Ukraine so there is no ethical reason why China cold not supply their long time ally. The only issue they would have is how the West's sanctions may effect their economy. Realistically they have the West over a barrel as they supply so much of our every day goods so I don't see sanctions against China hitting any time soon or being very effective. I think they would help Russia if they fear Russia was about to be crushed but Russia has, and will not be attacked so that reason won't be valid.
If Russia want to keep turning up the heat rather than admit defeat then we're going to come to blows.
There will more than likely be a conventional war before nuclear war.. stop pretending like you're the only one who understands the implications.
Any nuclear exchange would probably only come if one side got too close to winning the conventional war first. Neither China or the US would want to fire the first shot unless their theoretical backs were up against the wall and it was the last choice.
