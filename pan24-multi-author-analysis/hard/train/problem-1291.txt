Okay but shouldn't we be doing better than that? "But Donald Trump blah blah blah" is not a good response.
He didn’t need to win Georgia to win the presidency though. And why would she have deserved the VP nomination for something that didn’t happen until after that?
I don't think a politician whose highest office held was minority leader of a state house would be a good choice to be the Vice President of the United States.
That's an incredible thing to say when someone who hasn't been elected to any office won the presidency in the 2016 election.
And I note that you said "held" instead of elected; because it's clear to everyone that Abrams rightly won the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, which back then was a solid red state and is now a crucial purplish state thanks to Stacy Abrams' effort.
Stacy Abrams was a better VP choice if Biden wanted to court the female POC vote. Democrats would have never won the Senate and the White House if it wasn't for Stacy Abrams.
There are those people in congress and the senate, Harris just wasn't one of them. Biden has a much bigger profile than a lot of them and the field was honestly way too big (without ranked choice voting). None of the choices they announced or that were speculated for VP would've been the next "one" but someone like Karen Bass would've been 100% better than Harris. Personally hoping Ro Khana puts his hat in the ring for the 2024 primary (if there is one).
