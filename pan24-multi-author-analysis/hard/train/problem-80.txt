The genocide story was never about millions dead. It was claimed that millions were detained and subjected to various types of abuse including torture. It was always about a cultural genocide, not something like the Holocaust.
In case you were referencing the Uyghur genocide, no one is talking about mass extermination of people there. The claim is rather that China detained more than a million people there to systematically erase Uyghur culture, which is sufficient to match the definition of genocide.
The story is over a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps to be re-educated, not that they were all killed. The allegation is cultural genocide and forced sterilization in some cases. When your efforts are targeted against specific groups then it's possible for everyone to ignore it. The camps are also located far away from population centres out of public view.
Most of the people currently protesting are Han Chinese and the majority of Urumqi are Han Chinese, many fairly recent migrants. This is something that effects everyone equally and happened in the middle of a city of 4 million. Also, people all over China are tired of these restrictions and resistance has started happening in places like Guangzhou even without a tragedy like the fire. People are running out of food and can't work under lockdown.
