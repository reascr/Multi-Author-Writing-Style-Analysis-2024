Just like Elon - it's only censorship when other people do it, when I do it it's just the right thing to do. No one is more hypocritical about free speech than conservatives.
No, slander is a crime; and he’s advocating for free speech. Hitler took over the media first which is exactly what the left is doing; they already have dominance in tech and social media, along with established media. Add to that coordination between government and big tech and the “private business “ argument goes out the window. Rationality is gone. The hypocrisy is embarrassingly blatant. Facts are.
Education is the source of the problem. You fix that and most of the rest takes care of itself. Trying to monitor speech has historically always lead to conflict or tyranny.
We have certain laws that protect speech and businesses and there is an enormous amount of hypocrisy when it comes to how they’re interpreted. But it’s more complicated than that because businesses like twitter and Facebook have incredible influence and appear to be working with government to predominately silence conservative voices. Now with musk, we may be getting the same thing in the other direction; too early to tell.
