Of course it is. Its not about him being a welder specifically, but more that he feels confident enough in his foreign policy knowledge as a laymen to shit on a lifelong diplomat. Bet he couldnt point Taiwan out on a map.
The the other side of the strait is Taiwan. If America and its allies control the strait, they can choke China. No shipping means, effectively, that the CCP’s hold on power is not longer acceptable internally.
But do we really think that Americans will forever care enough about an island of 23 million people that’s 7,600 miles from America? And only 100 miles from China? Is it worth going to war with the only other superpower over Taiwan? No way Americans are going to buy that.
China makes stuff and sells it to everyone else. The CCP gets to stay in power because they make sure everyone is employed and fed. The only real way out of China is the ocean. The shipping lanes out of China pass between Okinawa and Taiwan, sometimes very narrowly.
China is going to have Taiwan eventually. But I don’t think the United States has to make it easy for them. Soft power matters.
