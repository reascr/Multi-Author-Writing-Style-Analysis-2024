You mean it served its purpose when he escaped 20 years after his first murder, only to murder the mother of two young children, or this time around, when he used his last words to espouse some narcissistic whataboutism?
Meanwhile, this sub is cheering for the guy who fatally stabbed the mother of two young children during a prison escape, where he was already serving life for killing someone else.
Death row guy stabbed a woman to death after escaping prison, and he was in prison for murdering a sheriff’s deputy.
According to the article, he was sentenced to death for the 1990 stabbing of a woman during a carjacking while he was on the run after escaping from prison where he was serving a life sentence for a 1979 killing of a sheriff’s deputy.
"Donald David Dillbeck (May 24, 1963 – February 23, 2023) was an American convicted murderer executed by the state of Florida for stabbing a woman \[to death\] in a Tallahassee mall parking lot in 1990 after escaping from prison, where he was serving a life sentence for killing a sheriff's deputy in 1979.".
No. Getting fired is not at all comparable to getting killed. An argument could be made DeSantis has caused more harm because his actions have negatively impacted such a large amount of people, but you shouldn't trivialize the actions of Dillbeck. He is a murderer.
I see. Thanks for the clarification. I agree with you that politicians not taking COVID seriously has caused great bodily harm (and death) to tons of people.
