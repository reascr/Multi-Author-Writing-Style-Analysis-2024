That's essentially what one of my older, Trump-adoring neighbors always argues. "If Trump is as guilty as liberals say, why hasn't he been convicted or arrested for anything??".
At least that's my take. I know some idiot will come at me with some bs about how I'm "BoTh SiDeS"ing it.... but I'm not. I'm well aware of h√≤w different both parties are. Just reread what is written and understand the difference before telling me I'm just a libertarian or conservative troll or some other such bullshit.
This isn't about republican vs democrat and who is worse... though I am well aware of how much more republicans suck and I've never voted for one.
My point is that Dems can say to Republican voters - we told you all along he was lying to you, and look, here's the proof.
It'd be a good way for Democrats to show that lies have consequences; and that Republicans aren't the only ones who can work the political outrage machine.
I don't know the answer exactly, but relying on the same old democratic doublespeak that allows for them to sound like they want changes only for them to point at the republicans and shrug and say, "Well, we tried but they wouldn't let us do it... oh well. Gotta go to a fundraiser now. See ya." seems to be what we're doing... again.
