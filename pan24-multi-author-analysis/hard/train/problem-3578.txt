If the country is to be fixed, it needs a massive infrastructure overhaul with a government installed not by the UN and not seeking handouts from them either. What that looks like, I don't know.
EDIT: Back in the day, I wrote the wiki article on the 2004 coup (when Wikipedia was still a new thing), and I'm impressed today to read that Aristide's entry ascribes responsibility to "right-wing paramilitary groups entering from the DR," and cites a single source - a political polemic - from 2012 as the evidentiary foundation for this. Which mostly goes to show that interest groups (namely, one in San Francisco that is largely clueless on Caribbean matters but find them to be a convenient political cudgel) can wrest a conversation - and thus the opinions of some - in absolutely wrong directions.
Like anything else, it's pretty complicated. The Bush administration did nothing in 2004 to prevent Aristide's ouster, the UN did nothing in 91 to prevent Aristide's first ouster, the US cut deals with some genuinely awful people to restore Aristide to power in 94. Anyone who views the issues in Haiti from the very ethnocentric Western right/left axis is going to be in for a hard time understanding what is actually going on, because failed nations do not neatly fall into our ideological boxes.
This decision is pretty unpopular with a lot of Haitians on the ground despite political support, but Canada's hands are kind of tied as the only alternative - which would be (and look) much worse - is doing nothing.
