Did they really care about the Taiwan visit? I only remember that one random guy saying china would retaliate, which Reddit took as “XI JINPING PROMISES WAR IF PLANE LANDS IN TAIWAN”.
Any talk of war with China would be in China's back yard in the Taiwan Strait for Taiwan, and probably with the UK/Australia/Japan involved.
A Chiniese war with Taiwan would probably be catastrophic for the world. Saying Biden or any president should demand Taiwans independence is foolish and doesn't understand the consequences of what would potentially happen. Or saying Biden is weak for taking to China. No, he is trying to prevent the world from economic ruin and from the US getting drawn into a proxy war with China that would make Russia/Ukraine look tiny and insignificant. And may very well pull the US into war itself with China.
If China were stupid enough to engage mainland US on US soil, then lord help them, because they don't stand much or a chance. Whether you're pro, anti or controlled 2A, I'd wager most gun nuts and hoarders would hand a weapon to their non armed next door neighbour to defend against an invasion.
As a Brit, we know that what ever war US is in, we'll like be in too. Now, I don't doubt the might of our respective countries, but do not underestimate an opponent. Besides the huge amount of military spending, one of the US militarys biggest boons is in sheer numbers. Its, from my understanding, one of the big tactics the US uses, overwhelming numbers. Should the US get pulled into a war with China, it must be remembered that China has almost twice the amount of personel. They also have a larger amount of naval ships than the US. Their budget however is smaller (2nd to the US).
I feel like a seige would be China's most likely route. A war without bullets. Control the waters, control an island.
