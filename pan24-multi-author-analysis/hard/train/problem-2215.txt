Yeah, do we really think a guy like Putin is going with "well, our military is woefully undersupplied and has underperformed as a result of rampant embezzlement and corruption leaving me in a humiliating no-win position, but that's on me because I encouraged, enabled, and profited from that culture"?
It's impossible for us peons to know for sure, but it really looks like Putin misjudged the war readiness of his armed forces, which leads me to believe that he didn't realize the depth or degree of the corruption. And you're probably right, he probably also does know about some corruption and turns a blind eye in order to have dirt on his people, and also as a reward for supporting him. I think that both can be true.
I bet both are true. It's all made worse by the fact that on paper the corruption doesn't exist. And everything is perfect. To bridge this gap between reality and expectations everyone lies about everything when talking to their higher ups, and their higher ups know it's a lie but roll with it because the success of everyone involved including them is dependent on this lie being accepted. So the lies spiral up through the ranks until they hit Putin, who is in the worst position to understand that everyone is lying to him, so badly misunderstands his own troop readiness.
