But like now is it... Real cannibalism, or the fear of it, so a (providing modern economic activity) and gets to tell their friends they totes almost got eaten.
cannibalism as practiced by John 'Liver eating' Johnson, Daniel Rakowitz, Richard Chase has been part of American culture for hundreds of years; true. Does that mean its not a slander to allege all American communities and families engage in it? So is your comment racist, have a second guess.
That was pity foul but 1969 is NOT the crux, the crux of betrayal and violation of international law began in 1962 when our governments were blackmailed to authorise the UN invasion/disarming of West New Guinea (General Assembly resolution 1752) ; it is ILLEGAL to then conceal resolution 1752 & the 'New York Aggreement' it was authorising from the Trusteeship Council whose job it is to prepare yearly UN reports about UN trust territories such as West Papua (West New Guinea).
Michael Rockefeller was poking his nose into Asmat territory which at the time included the river coming down from Ertsberg in which their Freeport mining company wanted to build a port for exporting Papua's gold, silver and copper to the US and other markets.
Freeport WAS owned by the Rockefellers and members of Robert Lovett's bonesman network, the first open pit site Ertsberg was depleted twenty years ago and the second larger Grasberg depleted several years ago since when they have been digging under the base of the mountain to reach more of the gold, silver and copper. Because the extreme high profitbility era (open-pit) is over the US shareholders have been selling their holdings to the Indonesian government that shares their interest to keep their looting of Papua secret.
