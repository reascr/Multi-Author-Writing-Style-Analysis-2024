This isn't what Christians do. Christians are literally taught from pre-school forward that it is their responsibility to save the souls of the masses by converting them to follow Jesus.
You aren't protected though. Your state might allow abortions but without the medications covered in this particular state this will also effectively outlaw abortions in blue states by making them functionally impossible within a reasonable time span. These two drugs are responsible for 75% of abortions, without them abortion clinics will have to pick up even more slack to do physical in person abortions. Waiting lists for abortion providers are already several weeks long for the physical procedure. If the SC agrees with the premise of this group you will be looking at women that have to wait so long to get an abortion they will most likely have given birth by the time they can see a physical provider. There are not enough providers to cover the loss of this medication, this would functionally ban abortion for the vast majority of women.
Abortion should be legal nationwide, as well as abortion pills, but this is a bad analogy. They want abortion banned because they think abortion is murder (even though Jesus had no children, never condemned abortion, and said let he who is without sin cast the the first stone). “If you don’t like murder then don’t do it” is not a reasonable thing to say, because it implies murder should be legal for people who like it, but murder is a crime for anyone, it’s not just a personal preference. If a moral code doesn’t apply to everyone then it’s useless.
I think abortion and abortion pills should be legal nationwide, because there is no right to live inside someone else’s body without consent. But I don’t think “If you don’t want something then don’t do it” is valid moral reasoning.
