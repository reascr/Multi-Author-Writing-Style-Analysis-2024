I think people forget that Mueller was constrained by DOJ policy in general and Barr in particular. Further that a criminal investigation into Trump's relationship with Russia would need to produce a crime. Collusion is not a crime. Unless Mueller could uncover a written or spoken agreement between Trump and Putin, the investigation was always going fall short of expectations - despite Trump having worked with Russia in general, and Putin in particular, for decades.
Maybe it's just me. I like Mueller, respect him, and read this as about as dry comedy gold as it gets.
"His deceit, which is a fundamental component of the crimes of conviction and relevant conduct, extended to tax preparers, bookkeepers, banks, the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice National Security Division, the FBI, the Special Counselâ€™s Office, the grand jury, his own legal counsel, Members of Congress, and members of the executive branch of the United States government. ".
Yeah. I had spent months getting beat down because I didn't trust Mueller. I was also able to read between the lines Barrs memo and knew what the report said before it came out.
