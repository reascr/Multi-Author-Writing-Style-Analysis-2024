They can always stop being a clown and join the audience by surrendering to the nearest Ukrainian UAV.
Sending clowns seems reasonable when you look at the state of the russian army equipement. They can make the soldiers maybe laugh about their 70's Kalaschnikow which has no bullets and doesn't work.
I'm surprised that they even need to send any clowns when there's an entire Russian army to laugh at.
There's an old Russian proverb: "Кто в армии служил - тот в цирке не смеётся"/"The one who has served in the army, laughs not in the circus".
The jokes write themselves, but every military sends performers to entertain troops, the USO is famous for it. It seems to be a significant morale boost. I would love to see Russian circus performers, but the USO is more likely to inflict pop-country music like Toby Keith on the troops, which surely violates some element of the Geneva Convention.
I knew a guy who claimed to have accidentally called in an airstrike on Toby Keith in Baghdad. Possibly one of those stories that gets passed around and everyone who tells it is the guy who did it, but it was still a good story.
