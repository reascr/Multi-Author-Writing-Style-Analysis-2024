OH and Trump broke other laws including obstruction. He demonstrated intent to take them without national need and he obstructed the DOJ on the return. Trump took an off ramp from the above points. Lock him up.
I am sure I'll get responses, but it is just looking at how to proceed in a manner which makes it better going forward and not bogs us down in the past.
- They need to create separate classifications to those documents which are office bound and those that are transportable to be returned. The ability of our senior leaders to do their jobs has to be considered too.
- maybe we need an amnesty period for other senior leaders to self report now and turn over everything they accumulated without intent to steal.
Iâ€™m thinking there needs to be a general amnesty declared for former and current federally elected folks with access to look for and turn in anything they find. Say 6 months from now. After that, we get to assume you are keeping the documents for nefarious purposes and bring the hammer down.
