The drones are Ukrainian made so not US weapons bombing Russia though at this point, US frankly doesn't give a damn what Putin thinks.
It is very clear that Ukraine is attacking Russia with drones and this will increase after Zelensky appeared before US Congress and got the political support along with the military supplies.
Oil prices, run up by and the Ukraine war were propping up Russian economy. Now that Trump/GOP have lost the 2022 election, that price manipulation is falling apart and prices have dropped 25% and are going down. Russian economy is crumbling and the Ukraine war very expensive.
Surprised there have not been Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian gas, water and electric facilities to match the attacks on those in Ukraine. Cut off all Russian exports of gas and oil.
EU companies still buy Russian gas. But the situation got worse when Russian gas companies in EU were forcefully nationalized as Gazprom in Germany.
And Gazprom has been nationalized because they own large gas reservoirs which are now owned by the state.
