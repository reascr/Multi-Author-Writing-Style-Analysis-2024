That depends entirely upon the school. Around here, the public schools don't while the private schools do. And usually the punishment for violating the dress code here isn't getting arrested.
The federal government didn't go around killing protesters and/or sentencing them to death like what Iran is doing. The George Floyd protests also prompted social reform on various government levels (as an example, the federal government passed an anti-lynching bill). And no, Derek Chauvin is serving time in prison for what he did to George Floyd. Contrast that with Iran again, where Mahsa Amini's killers are unaccounted for and the regime has no intention of altering the rules in response to social unrest.
Protests and demonstrations happen every day in the US. That tends to happen when its people are guaranteed the rights of free speech and free assembly. And quite often they take place without incident. That's the way it should be.
And how many times has a dress code violation led to an offender's death in the West? Just because Western society isn't perfect doesn't mean it can't call out outrageous offenses elsewhere? This is just one big whataboutism.
This comment is almost gibberish, holy shit. The guy who killed George Floyd is serving 22 years in prison, you have literally no idea what you are talking about.
