You can find people to believe anything. We had this confirmed over the past few years with COVID. There are plenty of people in Russia who will latch onto this BS to buttress their support of the war.
Note the wonderful overlap between Russia supporters in the West, COVID deniers, anti-vaxxers, and QAnon types (spoiler: they are the same picture).
In short, Putin is trying to make the Holy War happen, and it ain't happening, because the postmodernist apathy of his regime's ideology makes people not care about that, just like they don't care about how much Putin steals.
At the start I thought if Russia would struggle Putin would be replaced but by now it seems as if the whole country really is ok with being completely wrecked just so they don't have to accept a loss.
...unless they make people rise up for a Holy War, which is the futile bet Putin is currently making (based on the rhetoric in Russian media). Yes, it won't work. But Putin is still making this bet because that's the only one he can still make.
That, however, includes Putin himself. He didn't get the memo that the times have changed. And now he's not getting the memo that the war is already lost. We'll see a lot of tragic things happen because of that.
