For me and my young family, it was the first year to celebrate on Dec 25 since we are not religious but our grandparents were (passed).
As Ukrainian, I can say that my family and almost all my friends are celebrating Christmas on December 25th now. And we are from the Orthodox region of Ukraine.
The Eastern Orthodox church does not originate from Russia nor is this a Russian tradition. The difference in dates has to do with calander systems. Julian dating systems were kept by the Orthodox church while the Catholics moved dates to account for the time difference of the, at the time, newer Gregorian calender system. Some orthodox countries like Greece have moved to the new date but many have not.

Ignore the real integration of Pre-Orthodox Christianity in Ukraine in 988 AD with the Kyivan Rus lead by Volodymyr I establishing these ties with the Patriarchate of Constantinople and building the first church in Kyiv (who later followed the later during the schism and became part of the eastern church). Ignore the fact that the basis for Orthodoxy in Russia (and infact the Russian Orthodox Church) actually originated in Ukraine hundreds of years before Russian Imperialism, and you can arrive at your answer if you take a few more leaps in logic.
Like it or not, Orthodoxy would not have become a mainstream Christian church without the Russian empire, and the use of the Julian calendar by the Orthodox church went hand in hand with the Russian empire using Julian calendar in secular context too until 1917 - you can argue what came first, of course, but the fact remains that celebrating Christmas on Jan 6th/7th in Ukraine is associated with Russian colonial rule and (strangely) not Ethiopian orthodoxy. And there's very little appetite for that at the moment.
