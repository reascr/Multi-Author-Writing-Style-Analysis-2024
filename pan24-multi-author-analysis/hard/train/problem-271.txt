Really should have said terrorist attacks or attempted assassinations. The more obvious assumption based on the headline is it politicians shooting at people.
Does it seem damn likely these shootings were related and politically motivated? Absolutely. The reporter might even hold that opinion too, but they can’t state it as fact.
Yes, seriously. I’m talking about investigators in a legal sense. Maybe you don’t realize this, but investigative reporters and police/FBI investigators are extremely different from each other in both a professional and legal sense.
Investigative reporters are not cops without badges. They do not have the same role and cannot operate the same way legally. They work under the same constraints and ethics as any other reporter.
you know there are people out there who's job title is literally "Investigative Reporter". The do in fact investigate things, compile evidence then report on the facts they uncovered. There are many cases where reporters are the ones that uncovered evidence that authorities missed and even cases where official investigations were not even started until after a story was broke by a reporter.
