Keep an eye on Marianne Williamson. As of right now, she’s the only one who’s pledged to influence the democratic platform for the better. I really hope we get a real candidate, but the best we can do in the run-up to the primaries is support her.
We’ve known the candidates and outcome for years now. In the next year we’ll all forget and get excited about the new candidates and shakeups, but Biden was always going to win a close race against Trump in ‘24.
I'm cautiously optimistic that voters, whether in Arizona or elsewhere, will start to reap what Biden has been sowing, or at least have a clear path to doing so, and of course, that Trump's standing in the public eye will only worsen in the next 20 months.
For the record, although I'm optimistic this will happen, and it absolutely would in a perfect world, we don't live in a perfect world. Unless you're Reagan in 1984, no race is boring enough to be worth ignoring or slacking off on. (That is how we got President Trump!).
But things change. We've seen the midterms -- and that taking Biden's approval ratings into account. Trumpism and extreme election denialism are simply that unpalatable, perhaps independent of any other policy.
