Except in this case the guy donated millions publicly to the Democrats, and millions secretly / anonymously to the Republicans.
because his parents are highly invested in the Democratic Party and it was a very bad story for them when this guy was stealing people's money and donating it to the Dems? obviously, that's a bad look, and it's very easy for him to come out and counter that with "oh yeah, donated to the republicans too just can't tell you or show you where or how lol".
if you can't see why this is a suspicious statement by him without any further evidence/proof, then you're pretty hard into the koolaid. i'm not saying it's impossible, i'm just saying it's convenient, and it doesn't make much sense.
him publicly donating to dems shows that he at least thinks the public sees them as "the good guys" .. combine with his family history, and without proof it is very fishy that he suddenly comes out to admit to more fraud with the only positive outcome being that the Dem party looks less sketchy, if only by the Republican party looking equally sketch on this specific issue.
If you actually listen to his interview he says he donated equally to both parties, but had to make his republican donations dark because if he did not, the media would have picked it up and ran with it, not mentioning that he also gave equally to the dems as well.
