I have a Chinese doctor who gladly admits that China reverse engineers American products but he says China actually makes them better. He’s towing the party line I think.
You maybe on to something. He acts ignorant when I bring up the Xi looks like Winnie the Poo. He claims he’s never heard of this meme?!? I find that practically impossible . Probably just playing dumb.
This is beyond dumb. If they did that, they would have lost all the data they collected. There was always a very high chance the balloon would never return.
The balloon obviously had communications. Different frequencies use different power levels over long distance. It would be ridiculously inept for them to be unable to support long range communication, especially at that altitude.
They're almost certainly using a derivation of open-source encryption technology just like absolutely everyone else. RSA et. al. is never going to be the weak point. It's not the 1940's anymore, with people competing against each other to encrypt messages securely. It's now down to math, and the most thoroughly vetted methods are the most secure. There would be no need to use other technologies across other parts of the military.
Beyond that, I'd expect anything military to use FHSS. You can modulo unixticks and use that to roll the frequency every couple seconds like an RSA key or TOTP. Use two transceivers and have the last frequency's transceiver "hunt forward" at the half-interval point and you never lose signal.
FHSS dwell periods are configurable(change the modulo) and it depends on the radio, but you're right that SINCGARS hops extremely quickly. Extreme frequency agility costs money, CPU/DSP time, and power consumption though.
