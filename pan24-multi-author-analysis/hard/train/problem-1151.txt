Paul Ryan is not running for anything, so he's in that legion of "brave" retired GOP politicians who once kissed Trump's ass but now criticize him. In fact, he's in that elite squadron of high profile GOP politicians who quit elected office rather than deal with Trump and the fucked up GOP antics anymore.
Are we supposed to forget that any evil Trump committed in office was not only allowed by Republicans but celebrated?
Even if you liked Trumps first run, you should understand that he shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near the office in 2024, and I think that’s what Ryan is getting at here.
Also- if Trump wins the nomination again for 2024 Paul Ryan will again prostrate himself and grovel at the feet of Trump again just like every other Republican will again.
So.......Paul Ryan isn't now and has never been someone with their "finger on the pulse" of the American People lol.
Paul Ryan also said something along the lines of "The American people will probably find Entitlement Reform (Read that as Slashing Medicare/Aid and Social Security Benefits) more palatable now".
