They got the Bosphorus that ain’t happening, and Erdogan aside Turkey’s been fighting alongside the US in our shitty wars in one way or another for over 70 years now.
So, this really boils down to NATO since they're the ones that have the international clout to make Erdogan stop clowning around.
Swede here: While on one hand it's great if Finland could join, it'll unfortunately mean that Sweden will withdraw from the whole thing once you join since our politicians are all fucking cowards. So it's really in NATO's best interest to ensure that Finland doesn't join first, because once you do, we have absolutely zero reason to care about NATO since we're protected on every side. The reason our PM is saying this is because he's covering his ass for when he'll later explain why we're not joining. (We warned them, etc etc).
Even if we were to somehow have our politicians continue the process, the reality is that even if they continue, Erdogan won't stop fucking around and demanding that we extradite people that haven't done fuck all except to piss him off. And while our politicians might do a lot of things in the interest of diplomatic relations, they know fully well that trying to get the innocent people on Erdogan's list extradited would be VERY illegal in terms of justice proceedings. Not to mention political suicide. So, for them, the safest way to get rid of this whole hot potato would be to simply "wait and see" and let you guys do all the hard work.
It was controversial as hell when it was decided that we would abandon our old neutrality, for a politician, it might be considered a conservative win if they were to nix the process.
