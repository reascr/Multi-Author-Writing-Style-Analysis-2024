Slaves were lucrative property for most slaveowners and were expensive to purchase in the first place. Then they had to feed, house and clothe them (though they usually did the bare minimum in those respects). This is why only the wealthy owned slaves generally speaking.
I guess my thing is, the descendants of slaves are still dealing with the effects centuries later. If I knew my family had owned slaves, I can't afford to give actual money, but I would like to say I'm sorry.
If the slavery was far in the past and wasn't directly used to catapult the family into wealth, then no.
Either way, the point is that people whose families were enslaved are worse off for it, while the slavers are better off for it.
Not defending the practice of paying slaveowners reparations back in the day, just explaining the reasoning for it back then.
None of this is an excuse for the abhorrent practice of slavery, or makes it any less terrible. One person owned by another was ONE TOO MANY. It was an ugly business that we shouldn't white wash but we also need to stop painting all pre-war southerners as evil and complicit.
