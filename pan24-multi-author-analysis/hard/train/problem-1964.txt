Yeah, that’s a brilliant idea. Start an official world war by directly attacking a western country when you’re having enough trouble with the one you illegally invaded a year ago. That’ll go over well.
Yeah, pretty much. UAVs would permanently exist over the major cities of Western Russia and assassinate oligarch after oligarch, and UK sending in SAS personnel to kidnap the others. They would probably do a catch and release and basically show them, "that's your mansion. You have 48hrs to eliminate Putin, or we will steal your compound and all your money. We will send you to an American prison, broke and convicted of sex with children. Good luck".
Do you think this stuff doesn't happen? FWIW, the oligarchs are probably guilty of that kind of stuff anyway. Also, they're guilty of propping up a murderous psychopath, so there's that.
The money would dry up instantly, and no one will answer Putin's calls, effectively ending the war. Putin will probably remain in his bunker dying an irrelevant death.
