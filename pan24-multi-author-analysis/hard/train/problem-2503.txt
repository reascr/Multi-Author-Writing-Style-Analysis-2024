Right, and plenty of research shows race regularly puts non-white people at a disadvantage. Diversity initiatives try to level the playing field due to pervasive pro-white bias.
Did it ever once occur to you the reason we have quotas is to confront the opposite problem; qualified minorities not getting hired because of racism?
This is a huge problem and if you hire based on race then it has a huge detriment to the work force as diversity hires arenâ€™t there because of skill but because they satisfy a race quota.
If there's no qualified diverse candidates, it's not illegal to hire the white dude. That's fine. But if there's no legal incentive not to? Odds are that we'll be the first picks most of the time...
So who does the hiring manager pick? Typically whoever they like the most, which is gonna be either who they're most sexually attracted to if they're that kinda person, or the person most similar to them... and if they're most likely some 30 or 40 something white dude? They'll be hiring the white dude applicants.
I'm saying this as a white dude too. Having diversity goals and such mostly just minimizes racism and nepotism. Even non racists are typically most likely to hire someone more similar to themselves subconsciously.
