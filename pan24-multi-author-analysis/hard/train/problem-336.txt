Did you bother to read the article because that’s not what it’s talking about. Also the only people able to afford a house were those given 100k by their parents? Myopic and off topic.
You realize that not what this piece is about right? It’s about people virtue signaling they want to help disenfranchised or homeless and then not wanting low income housing built in their neighborhood.
A modest proposal: do nothing about housing and let homeless people simply die of exposure, overdose, or starvation, thereby solving the problem of people being homeless. /s.
Affordable housing programs aren’t “missing the point.” They’re simply insufficiently funded. You might as well point out that western medicine is “flawed” when the problem is that there’s no hospitals in an area. The solution is to simply build a damn hospital, just like the solution to housing affordability isn’t to raise wages, it’s to simply build more affordable housing.
They don't really want affordable housing, they just pay the concept the necessary lip service because they know current society views affordable housing as morally good. But in practice they still look down on "those dirty poors" and don't want them "lesser folk" to be visible and threaten their property values.
Affordable housing requires sacrificing a bit of your ivory towers. Grow the fuck up already; that selfishness is part of what's fueling the housing crisis.
