Also, French is an official language on the federal level, but most provinces only have English as an official language, just like Québec only has French. And don't worry, the federal govt. functions 95% in English and the francophones who work there constantly have to switch to English in their daily lives, unlike their anglophone colleagues.
Tell me, what privilege do we have in Canada exactly? The privilege of knowing our culture can disappear, that part of our population is colonized and having to learn another language to function in our own home? Give me a break.
Removal of minority language speakers? Sorry but what are you talking about? Also if by discrimination you mean preferably choosing immigrants who speak French, sure we do that. I don't see what's wrong with it. People around the world don't have a right to live in Québec and we are allowed to choose people according to our interests.
There are even French speaking people in northern Quebec who don’t know that Quebec isn’t a country. I’ve met them. They don’t have passports and couldn’t be bothered with them anyways for there’s no desire for them to leave.
