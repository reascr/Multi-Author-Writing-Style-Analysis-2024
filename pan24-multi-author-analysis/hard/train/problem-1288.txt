He went into this because he absolutely needed to win in order for his regime to continue anyways. Russia’s entire society has been on the precipice of collapse, Vlad has managed to destroy pretty much all industry in Russia and bilk its populous dry. It’s already cashed in on or used up its major natural resources.
Super risky, but he tested the waters in Crimea first and no one came to Ukraines defense. The house of cards was coming down either way. A last stand if you will.
Imo, in Vlads eyes his options were annex the resource-rich territories of Ukraine to keep his country afloat or let the carcass of the Russian Federation come collapsing down and be exposed in the history books as a massive failure.
His claim more than two months ago that the annexed regions belonged to Russia came after the Russian military lost ground to a Ukrainian counteroffensive and followed hastily staged “referendums” that were rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies as a sham.
Putin, who has repeatedly said that Russia was ready to use “all available means” to protect its territory, including the annexed areas of Ukraine, rejected Western criticism that those statements amounted to nuclear saber-rattling.
Asked by a member of the Human Rights Council to pledge that Russia would not be the first to use nuclear weapons, Putin demurred, saying Russia would not be able to use nuclear weapons at all if it agreed not to use them first and then came under a nuclear strike.
The Russian leader said reminders of his country’s nuclear arsenal were “not a factor provoking an escalation of conflicts, but a factor of deterrence.”.
“If it doesn’t use it first under any circumstances, it means that it won’t be the second to use it either, because the possibility of using it in case of a nuclear strike on our territory will be sharply limited,” Putin said.
