Is this about the Su35 deal with Russia, Russia doesn't seem to be in a state to mass produce their own jet, i doubt they'll be able to produce in russia and sell it to Iran.
...but, like, I have a hard time believing that Russia is providing anything meaningful/new to Iran right now, more like they're paying back with equipment they can't really use in Ukraine because it'd get shot down anyway.
There might be an existing relationship between Iran and Russia, but Russia wasn't giving Iran modern fighter jets. Iran newest fighter jets are 50 years old F-4s. If Iran is now getting modern fighter jets and it's a big change in threat level of Iran toward country like Saudi Arabia.
The message is meant for Arab countries like Saudi Arabia who are helping Russia or staying on the sideline. This is telling them, hey Russia is helping your enemy get advance weapons, so why are you helping Russia.
That is so ridiculous when person from another country knows everything in details what Russian Army can do or cannot to do.You said, that “The are mobilizing army to the fullest…”.
Reserve of Russian Army only in Moscow is like 1million of people or more, what are you talking about?
