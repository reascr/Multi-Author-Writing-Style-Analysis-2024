No shit? It's rather well known at this point, that there's a fairly large and organised paedophile ring within the church, hiding behind the power and influence the church provides, and very clearly goes to the tippy top.
Pretty sure the Catholic church with the amount of known abusers and number of victims in the last 50 years puts the church as the largest pedophile protection ring in modern history.
Why does it surprise anyone that this pope (and probably most if not all before) endorses the molestation of children, come on people this is the Catholic Church we're talking about.
Not to defend the pieces of shit who are actively covering paedophiles in the catholic church, but the fact that there are more paedophiles in the church than in any other field working along children doesn't seem proven at all.
What I wonder is, is there anything else than isolated cases of paedophiles covered by a corrupted or afraid by the scandals hierarchy, or is it something bigger ?
Still, people covering such facts are also monsters and deserve the harsher punishements, and the catholic church definitely had been involved in covering such scandals, I'm just surprised to hear about a large paedophile ring, is it documented ?
We are talking covering up of crimes on a global scale, with hundreds to thousands of examples of just their failures to cover it up despite the reach and power the church has, never mind the current ongoing active priests abusing children, and ones we never heard about.
