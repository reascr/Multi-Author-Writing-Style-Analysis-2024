Sadly, until she’s back where she belongs, she will be a member of the U.S. House of Representatives with the ear of the probably speaker, and way more influence than she should have. I would like to see her hateful rhetoric implode the current GOP, but so far, the only people suffering are the ones they are focusing their hatred upon.
Get ten people even more centrists and the "middle" scared of Republicans and encourage each of them to terrify ten more and on and on.
So the far right wing of the party winning control, will likely result in just more people following suit.
I think the right, if mtg truly does win… will go far right and make the party even smaller. Which means more crazy ass gerrymandering and voting suppression laws… because that’s the only way the gop gets elected as is.
If I know they follow politics and do research and still vote for the gop they can get fucked. I’ve cut off so many friends living in purple pa. The country I want for my kids in the future is not controlled by racist disgusting fake religious zealots.
I can have respect for someone who doesn’t follow politics that still votes for the gop due to preconceived notions. Education and propaganda in the country is terrible.
