They were supposed to seize the airfield but they were never intended to strong point and take anything bigger than the outskirts of the airfield. Maybe that’s what you mean but since you’d said ‘secure the city’ I thought I’d mention these guys wouldn’t take Kyiv. Call in air and artillery assets, take villages, bridges and supply routes, defend a fix position with ATGMs etc etc, but they really failed because the column didn’t move at nearly the rate needed to relieve them.
Of course the Russians structure their units into battle groups that are very different that Western formations and I’m sure VDV has armor in their inventory but they are primarily airmobile, light vehicles like BMDd and BMPs etc. They just can’t assault a position like shock troops do.
Armies aren't giving guys specially fit rifles nor do they need to. That isn't how markmenship works.
AKs don't have cheek risers or adjustable stocks so that's irrelevant. AK iron sights also cannot be configured for that.
The AK platform has adjustable sights for range. If you don’t know the rifle, those sights are worthless.
