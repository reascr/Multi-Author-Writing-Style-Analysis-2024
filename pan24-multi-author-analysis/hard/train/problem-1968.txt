To any Spanish person here, wasn't that already the case before? In Germany I can take paid sick days for virtually any reason and certainly debilitating pain, even if it's in my toe.
Huh! I assume normal sick days are paid for by the company (that's how it is in Germany), so only in this specific case does the social security system jump in? That seems counterintuitive, but could stop employers from not hiring women for fear that they may have to pay them for three sick days every months.
If you think a handful of days a year is going to stop employers hiring women, you're going to be absolutely baffled when you find out about pregnancy leave.
Also when maternity leaves were extended in European countries americans were fear mongering that less women will be hired, never happened.
Not all countries have this kind of mentality dude. Heck I am in a 3rd world country and women's maternity was extended to 6 months and there was never such issues of hiring going down.
Eg, i am in a third world country, yet my company gives 6 months of paternity as well as maternity for employees.
Having said that, countries which implement longer maternity leaves also eventually move to extend paternity leave as well.
And yes, the current "anti-male" government really outplayed their conservative counterparts by extending paternity leave to match maternity leave.
