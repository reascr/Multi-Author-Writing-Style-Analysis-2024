You are correct. The soviets actually put out memos telling troops that they shouldn't worry about conserving ammo, and by the end of the second world war they had assaults with enough artillery to have one gun for every eight meters on the front.
Russia really going for the WW2 Germany strategy here, except if they knew anything at all they'd know the Germans stopped doing this shit because while you get a hopped up maniac soldier in the short term, the long term effects make them less effective overall. Of course, that's assuming the Russians even consider these troops as being able to last for more than one engagement; I suppose sending waves of drugged up prisoners intended to be disposable is likely the idea here.
It's important to remember that what we see of the war from any side may be propaganda, so it's true we can't know for certain how Ukrainian soldiers generally react to surrendering Russians. But I do want to mention that I i saw several videos of Ukrainian soldiers clearing out Russian trenches and putting their lives in extra risk by giving the Russian soldiers an opportunity to surrender instead of killing them on sight (in this particular situation). So while charging at your enemy is a bad idea in an attempt to surrender, I still believe these Russian men had the chance to surrender in other ways and chose not to.
