Even better, the committee should remind House Republicans that how they choose to respond to the subpoenas sets precedent for how others will respond to theirs.
Do subpoenas have an expiry date? Because there's hilarious hypocrisy and hijinks that Democrats and Cheney could get up to with this. A very simple "I will honor your subpoena when you honor mine.".
. Based on my reading, Democrats control the committee calendars, and deadlocked committee votes on legislation and Executive Calendar items can make their way from subcommittee to committee, then up to Schumer or McConnell if the deadlock remains. Either of them can then schedule a full senate vote, which can then be tiebroken by VP.
Moving the Jan 6. investigation to the Senate would be ideal, but for that we need to hold Warnock's seat in Georgia.
Senate committees require a majority vote to subpoena. Right now, due to how power is shared with the 50-50 split, committees need at least one Republican vote for that.
Nope. Stuff on the committee level is down to whatever can be hashed out in the power sharing agreement. Right now, every Senate committee has equal numbers Republicans and Democrats. With one more vote, though, Democrats will be able to appoint a majority to each committee.
