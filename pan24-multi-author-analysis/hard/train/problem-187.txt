Only if the donor was vaccinated very recently, couple weeks tops. In this case, the blood might have some of the immunological response inducers of the vaccine. Otherwise, the blood would only contain antibodies, which could fight the disease if it was present at the body at the time, but do not induce immunological memory and wouldn't serve as a vaccine.
If someone who is unvaccinated get a transfusion of vaccinated blood, would that be similar to the person getting a vaccination?
While I wish the parents would just take whatever blood they can get, would it not make more sense to just try to get unvaccinated blood in this scenario?
"Sure, we'd like our baby to live, but not at the cost of having some antibodies against another disease. If that's the case, fuck it, we'll just try and have a healthy one next time.".
Nothing in the article says anything about what their motives are for rejecting vaccinated blood, whether religious or otherwise.
Furthermore, there were, the last time I checked earlier during the pandemic, hardly any religions (I can't actually remember a single one, but just in case), that reject vaccination, let alone threaten their adherents with eternal hell if they should get vaccinated.
So really, it just comes done to psychopaths being willing to sacrifice their baby's life for no reason.
