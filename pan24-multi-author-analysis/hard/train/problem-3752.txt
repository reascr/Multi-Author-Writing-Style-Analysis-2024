So is the so called “conspiracies” about Donald Trump debunked or are they substantiated or grounded in some facts but not completely verified.
There is a real problem with part of this article. It says the Steele Dossier was largely debunked yet when looking at the cite which is to another Newsweek article which states.
In the article, "largely debunked Steeles Dossier" has a link to another Newsweek article that goes through 7 of its "biggest accusations". 3 are listed as "verified". 4 are listed as "Not proven". None are listed as "disproven" or "debunked" or anything remotely like that. From which Newsweek concludes that the Dossier is "largely debunked".
I am unaware of any issues presented in the dossier that have been proven untrue. I understand that many details are unconfirmed and that there have been massive character assassination campaigns against people who worked on or gave intel for the dossier, but not proven falsities.
If anyone can prove that the dossier at large, or even specific details included in it, are false, please present your evidence.
