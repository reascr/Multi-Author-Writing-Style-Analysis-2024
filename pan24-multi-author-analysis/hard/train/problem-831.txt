Ah, this shit again. I'm a 53 year old Swiss man and I have never seen or heard of people eating cats or dogs, beyond tales of poor mountain farmers resorting to eating things like pets, shoe leather and so on when trapped in the high alps or facing starvation from crop failures. Think Donner party type scenarios.
I guess Newsweek reporters will believe the stories of fringe animal rights groups told to a BBC reporter, without any independent verification of that information. In this case a German woman who sees Swiss pet eaters hiding everywhere, but only can produce whispers and anonymous personal communications as evidence. I recall Newsweek was once a reputable publication.
“Unlike most large American magazines, Newsweek has not used fact-checkers since 1996. In 1997, the magazine was forced to recall several hundred thousand copies of a special issue called Your Child, which advised that infants as young as five months old could safely feed themselves zwieback toasts and chunks of raw carrot (to the contrary, both represent a choking hazard in children this young). The error was later attributed to a copy editor who was working on two stories at the same time.”.
