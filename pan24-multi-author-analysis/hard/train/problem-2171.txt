Just because those are the cases that are easier to prove wrong doesn’t mean they are the only ones. If they’ve been able to show that just 20% can be easily shown as wrongful convictions, there are undoubtedly others that are just more difficult to prove.
I was asking for sources to your comment that 20% of 17 people on death row will historically be overturned/proven innocent.
So statistically it's been proven that 3.4 people out of every 17 are wrongfully sentenced to death?
On what basis is the death penalty "flagrantly unjust"? It is absolutely utilized in our criminal justice system. For instance, literally thousands of murder cases have been closed as plea deals for took the death penalty off the table for murders. Should we deprive aggrieved families of closure the death penalty can bring in both the death of the murderer or his further confessions to solve unsolved crimes? All so we can preserve the lives of those very murderers? Why is this even an issue when we have so many more systemic problems than extending the lives of criminals who whose crimes were deemed so heinous as to warrant death?
Someone who is found guilty of violent crime poses danger to society and must be kept away from society, but executing them is simply amoral.
