In this specific case, if a warship wants a plane to know, they'll know. By some rumors, modern shipboard radars may be powerful enough to damage equipment at close range.
However, modern radar based weapons can also be guided in TWS (track while scan). In this mode, the search radar is still scanning the sky for other targets, so the targeted aircraft won't see a change in behaviour and doesn't know it's been locked. The aircraft's RWR will know that there's a radar searching in the area which it will relay to the pilot, but the pilot will have to make a judgement call as to whether they're under attack or not. They'll only get a warning when the inbound missile goes 'pitbull' - which means it's turned on its own radar for terminal guidance. That only happens when the missile is close to its target, so the defending pilot won't get much warning.
There is, but it doesn’t automatically mean the other side is about to fling a missile at you or fill the air around you with steel. It just means they have that option if they decide to.
Also IIRC the radar signals from missiles are distinctly different from stationary systems. Because they’re accelerating hard the signals are blueshifted, so you can tell if you’re being hunted by a freshly launched missile that’s locked onto you.
