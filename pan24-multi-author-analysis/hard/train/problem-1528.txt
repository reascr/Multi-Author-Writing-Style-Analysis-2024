Not all pollution breaks down ozone like CFCs did. These are two totally separate issues in that regard.
1. We know the rate at which we are currently warming is 10x faster than anything previously recorded in the history of this planet. We know this from fossil and geological data. Every year we warm faster than the previous year. This has been measured independently by people all over the world. It’s a measured fact.
Nothing I’ve listed here is opinion or political view points. We are noticing abnormal warming, we have data to show why that warming is happening, and we have historical records that back up that data. This has been measured, remeasured, and verified by people all over the world who don’t care about any one country’s politics. These are hard facts that plainly can’t be refuted without willful ignorance. There is a pretty clear line between the gases we’ve been putting out there for a long time and the dangerous warming trends we are seeing.
Now it is all climate change because we've identified it as a problem but we aren't doing anything about it. It's not a conspiracy or some made up shit to "scare the populace" it's a serious problem but the solution is to stop releasing greenhouse gases including carbon and sulphur emissions but there's rather a lot of industries and countries even that rely heavily on this for income and are naturally reluctant to loose out on that money. They have the incentive to tell you climate change is bs because they have a financial stake in it but unfortunately peiple li yourself buy the whole climate change is bs.
