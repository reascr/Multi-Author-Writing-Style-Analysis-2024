Largely because after the Romans left there was a large scale population migration into England, who brought their language, culture and religion with them. In Roman times the population of what is now England were essentially Welsh. Wales and Cornwall and Scotland were the bits the incoming people didn’t reach.
In essence, the population has been largely non-religious for decades, but a lot of people identify as “Christian” for cultural rather than actual religious reasons. The number of people who self identify as belonging to the Church of England who actually go to Church is less than 10%. The main change is that people who lead non-religious lives are now being more honest about it.
Studys have proven that non religious people have a higher moral standard and are more accepting of minority groups and modern trends.
And in the recent years the pagan Church or whatever its called is growing while other religions are loosing members.
Eh the number of religious is still shrinking. They are just making up for it by ramping up the crazy at an impressive rate.
I don’t know why you call them Christian’s and participate in their game of pretend that it has anything to do with what Jesus talked about.
