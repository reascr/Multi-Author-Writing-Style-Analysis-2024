With that being said, a corporation just tries to make money. The individuals don't matter, you should never trust the institution. Instead, pass and enforce laws to incentivize the behavior you want.
A tight regulatory market basically entrances established players. Which is not inherently bad. Ultimately, I think it's probably a good thing. Yes, our banks are too big to fail, but I prefer a handful of well regulated players vs 1000+ institutions that collapse under systematic risk.
Contrary to what people think, institutions like GS love regulation. Maybe not every rule, but overall a more regulated financial sector plays to big, established banks.
sure, not all but vast majority of the policy-making bank management will be american. they do not necessarily make policies, they just bend them and get loans because they are too big to fail for the problem caused only by them and nobody else, let's instead let ripples kickoff the worst inflation since depression caused by, oh guess who, 80 years ago.
i have nothing to be outraged about, i live off of my own skills and work and do not leech off the other people nor am i in the money-mongering business, unlike bankers. neither i harbor specific national love or hate, it means nothing to me, sorry not sorry for being above that all. come hate on me some more with downvotes . it is the price of freedom i will gladly pay any and every day.
