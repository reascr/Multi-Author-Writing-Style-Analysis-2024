That’s a lot of details. Did you get those… from news stories? Do you have inside information? Are you just speculating?
The unveiling of what might well be a global program of Chinese surveillance balloons is a highly newsworthy development that would always push other stories off the front page.
Covering it up is giving it 1-2 articles that don't get put on any front pages while propping up a more bombastic headline, which in recent days has been alleged spy balloons.
Not sure what news everyone here is consuming but I’ve heard plenty about both the balloon shit and this derailment from multiple outlets. (yes, probably technically more about the ballon stuff, to be fair) The ramifications and implications of both stories are still vague and not fully known at best. Maybe we shouldn’t automatically jizz “cover up!1” over everything all the time. Also, has there ever been a time when the transportation secretary has been called out “for answers” more? Personally, I find that aspect of this possibly the most disturbing.
