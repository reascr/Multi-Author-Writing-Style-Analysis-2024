Depends on the crews, to be honest. If they are crewed well, that is an absolute force to be reckoned with. They are very capable machines. If they're operated poorly, their addition won't mean much aside from soaking up a few Russian munitions, which, still counts for something.
It certainly won't be a cakewalk, but Russia isn't really capable of supporting a massive push of 500,000 soldiers.
They already couldn't handle the logistics for 100,000 soldiers when they were fresh. Another 500,000 can only hope to wear down the Ukrainians through sheer attrition as they throw countless soldiers into the meat grinder, which isn't an ideal strategy in the least.
As Ukraine gets too notch tanks delivered to them and them preparing for that atack for a while now chances are not that bad of untaine wining out the war of nutrition.
Right now, what Ukraine needs is long range munitions, cruise missile defense (patriot) and non-arms support (generators, consumables).
Tanks will take months to arrive, the majority will probably not arrive until fall. Noone has comitted jets yet, but if they do it will take a year or more to get pilots, mechanics and logistics up to speed.
The scuttlebutt is that Putin wants a big symbolic push on 24th of this month, to coincide with some chestbeating celebrations at home.
