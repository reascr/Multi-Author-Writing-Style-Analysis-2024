Watching unionization spread has been wonderful. At will employment states and the other anti-labor practices Republicans have put into place have grossly eroded the average worker's quality of life and purchasing power.
Working class has been getting exploited for a few generations now, coincidentally at the same time union membership has been declining. Huh.
Agreed. Cooperation is a key tool in competition with others and life..all life is in competition. That’s been a key scientific model for well over a century. It’d be pretty big news of TToE was proven wrong.
My original point though was that unions were and are an important tool for people to act against exploitation. To just sit back and take what others deem them worth would eventually lead to pretty harsh conditions and compensation…as history has shows us many times.
I’m not sure what “economic injustice” is, but I think it’s important for people to always remember that it’s human nature for other humans to try and exploit you if they can. You’ll always have to fight against that…and pretty hard at that.
