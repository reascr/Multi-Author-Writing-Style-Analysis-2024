The only troubling part about this is that these sustained and continued attacks on the legitimacy of our elections are probably doing significant damage public perception of government legitimacy.
If that's really the case Democrats shouldn't sue just let them get their own results thrown out, costing the GOP a seat in the house. If that actually happened this would never be an issue again.
This whole nonsense is beyond exceptionally dumb. First of all they're not even claiming there were issues in Cochise County instead they're claiming there were issues in Maricopa County. Additionally, if they do not certify their results (they'll likely be forced to by a judge) all that happens is that the results from Cochise end up excluded which would only serve to increase the margin of victory for Democrats.
If they fail to certify the votes and an entire county loses their vote causing the seat to flip dem they will probably try to sue saying republican votes weren’t counted correctly. Trump will take it to the Supreme Court . Probably, I don’t even understand this timeline anymore.
