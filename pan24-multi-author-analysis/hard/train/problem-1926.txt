So why are you defending this huge piece of shit? Why are you pretending that he's a good person? Where's your argument that he's a good person worth defending?
It's no wonder you defend him tooth and nail even when he's committed so many atrocities. You're not mentally equipped to see the many terrible things he's done.
Well this will be an unpopular comment, but by in large, he's equally bad but just in different ways. Bolsanaro did some good, but a lot of bad, and Lula really is the same...only the topic changes.
And no, I'm not a Bolsanista nor am I far right. I'm a foreigner living here long enough to have seen both sides rule... They're "same same, but different".
