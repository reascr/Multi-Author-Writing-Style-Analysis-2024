Edited to add a reply to the comment below about the spectrum since Reddit won’t let me actually post a reply. Both sides play the game of politics which unfortunately involves lying at some point. One side is predicated on a platform of at least one large fallacy that cuts right to the core of democracy and will eat what used to be it’s own to support it. All despite essentially irrefutable evidence against it. That lies on its own very firmly at one end of the spectrum.
I’m not part of any ‘we’ so I will let the game play out as is. The right declared war against the truth and should face those consequences.
So because the right wing declared war against the truth, we also have to start spewing baseless accusations now?
If it is not okay for the right wing to throw around false flag accusations, why is it okay for us to do it?
Come on man. How is this any different from when a right winger says white supremacist terrorism is a false flag?
The frequency of violence and terror by right wingers versus the frequency of same by leftists. The frequency of claims of “false flag operations” (unsupported and in fact contradicted by the evidence) by right wingers versus the same by leftists. The promotion of violence and terror by right wingers versus decrying the same by leftists.
Rhetorically, the right wing are the ones primed for violence and false flags. The right wing are the ones promoting violence and terror against their “enemies” (implicitly or explicitly denying their opponents humanity). Leftists refer to them as opponents and decry violence (against anyone). Additionally, the right wing constantly makes claims of “false flag operations” in response to right wing violence, which combines well with their penchant for projecting. As a result, the balance of probability is on a false flag by her own organization. If I’m wrong, it’s because of the boy-who-cried-wolf response.
