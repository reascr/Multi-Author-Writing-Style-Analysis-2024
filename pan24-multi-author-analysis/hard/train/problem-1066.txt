Once they all realize that their badge doesn't shield them from consequences we'll see a drastic change in how police act in this country.
The core problem is the police need to make changes AND acknowledge that they need to earn our trust back because their bullshit isn't isolated incidents it's everywhere.
I think you underestimate how hard it is to police a distrusting to down right hostile populous. Which is why they have a history of doing what they do in these situations. Again I'm not defending the police I personally have my own reasons for not trusting the police.
The onus isn't on the people to trust the cops, it's on the cops to act trustworthy. It's not a negotiation. It's not even a dialogue. People trust the cops, or don't, based on how they act.
Cops will get trust when they earn it. I don’t know why you mean about giving them the change; they’re still armed agents of the state right? We don’t need to give them anything, they have the authority. How much would you like to bet that they’ll continue to use that authority in ways that don’t foster trust?
