Please, please, please, let the majority of these votes break in favor of Warnock! He's a wonderful Senator and Walker is... a lot of things, among them, unfit for office.
Sadly, after seeing their platform rebuked, some republicans have decided that the problem isn't that they're out of touch with the people—it's that they need to raise the voting age and further restrict voting rights for women and minorities!
It’s almost as if giving people all these opportunities, like being able to vote when they don’t have to be at work, is an engaging and empowering way to inspire them in their right to vote… strange indeed.
It's smart of Democratic voters to vote early because on the 6th Republicans are going to engineer all kinds of issues in Blue areas, on top of the unconscionably low number of voting machines and places in those areas.
In case that difference isn't clear: If there are 4 voters that vote Republican every single time, 4 voters that vote Democrat every single time, and 1 voter that votes evenly for either of them, then that's pretty close. But if polling shows that that 1 voter is 90% likely to vote Democrat this time, then there's a 90% chance the Democrats will win, even though the final tally will still be close.
The largest demographic group of Republican voters in Georgia are 30-49 and 65+ only makes up 20% of the Republican voters. The distribution is pretty close to Democrats except for the fact that the Democrats have 12% of their voters in the 65+ category. ().
