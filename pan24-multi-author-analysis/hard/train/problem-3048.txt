Sane people: "Oh, no problem, see, we're just gonna teach people about slavery and the Civil War in school.".
Oh yeah. The founders were a bunch of bickering slave owning aristocrats from 200 years ago. But they are seen as demigods from some idealized time. It’s a huge problem in America because we can’t move past them as a result.
There’s also what happened in the decades following the official end of slavery after the civil war. Things like black codes, pig laws, debt peonage, redlining, and of course Jim Crow and segregation.
did a good job explaining a lot of it and the problem with how America generally teaches it’s history.
Which is exactly why you need a program written by minority scholars that teaches their history and concepts.
How about a course covering Latino, Asian-American and African-American history? Kind of a non-Euro centric US history class. Cover most of the bases. I'm not sure why African-American history needs a separate course like this at the high school level. Clearly, college is a different story.
