Guess what? If the GOP tries to gridlock the country so they can look at Hunter Biden's laptop, pass anti-abortion legislation, save Trump or do a hundred other stupid things...
I mean, fuck, you think legislation just pops into existence whenever Nancy waggles her fingers, and they can get unanimous agreement from the Senate by giving a smile? That's not how this shit works and by this point I'm beginning to think anyone ignoring that is doing so willfully!
Democrats haven't had a proper chance to codify Roe since the 1970s. They had a mere 24 in-session days of Senate supermajority in 2009-2010 during which it was known that at least one Dem senator was vehemently anti-abortion and several weren't convinced on that whole universal healthcare thing. This was also before Republicans proved themselves so unceasingly obstructionist that they had to break the filibuster in order to continue the basic functions of government, so everyone was still pretty confident that they needed to keep it around.
Their current 50 majority is so razor thin you might cut yourself looking at it and has an open obstructionist in Sinema whose positions are further right wing than many Republicans and an old school blue dog in Manchin who represents extremely red territory and acts like it.
Again, Nancy cannot waggle her fingers and make legislation appear out of thin air, and getting unanimous agreement from the Dems in the Senate is not so simple.
