Don't be a child. Admit drugs are harmful, people can't moderate their use as they're all addictive, and drugs and drug supply chains fund worldwide suffering.
From my understanding opiates are only dangerous because you could accidentally take a lethal dose. Like if you come back to your use after a break and your tolerance have gone down, or you don't know the strenh of what you are taking. Opiates are very addictive and hard to quit and will produce a physical reaction from the withdrawal. But it's not impossible to get through.
When it comes to the toll on your body then I believe stimulants like amphetamines (meth especially) are much worse. A long term amphetamine addiction is going to wreck your body. Withdrawal on amphetamines isn't as hard as opiates physically but it can be tough mentally, potentially causing a lot of anxiety. They are also likely starved and have a deficiency in various things.
Then you have benzo. Benzo and alcohol are the only drugs that you can die from quiting cold turkey as far as I am aware.
