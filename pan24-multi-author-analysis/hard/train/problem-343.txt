- did you know that at one time you could have used “commuter trains” to get from the midwest to the east coast?
I've been on trains around New York, and I've taken Amtrak once from the Emeryville, CA to Eugene, OR. I didn't care for that trip. Too long not to have gotten a sleeper.
If Chicago to Minneapolis arcing through Wisconsin makes sense economically, and it certainly does topographically, then no good reason not to improve rail travel through there.
Looks like the distance is about 80 miles. About the same as in the San Francisco Bay Area from Fremont to Antioch by BART. My point: 80 miles sound like a job for light rail.
Legitimately curios: how much business travel is there between Chicago and Minneapolis/St Paul? That said, Chicago to Milwaukee to Madison to Minneapolis at 160mph on average would make one helluva lot more sense than California's HSR project. IF RIDERSHIP WERE SUFFICIENT. If it really took only 3 hours by rail from Chicago to Minneapolis or the reverse, compared to a 1 hour 20 minute flight with further travel from airport to downtown (not trivial from O'Hare to anywhere else in the metro area between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM, even if taking the Blue Line), would such rail service be preferable?
