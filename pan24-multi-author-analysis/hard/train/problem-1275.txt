It's not that the crowd was smaller; it's that the ideology was always fundamentally self-focused. The protest songs people point to were written by members of the Silent Generation, not Boomers. The Vietnam war and draft was ongoing for years (Vietnam started in 1955, and ramped up in 1964), but didn't prompt outrage until it was Baby Boomers getting drafted. If you want a look into the era without rose-colored glasses, read by Joan Didion. In retrospect, it's not at all shocking that Madison Avenue had a pathetically easy time turning the privileged among that generation to reject any communitarian values in favor of "this is what I need, and my personal growth is the most important value.".
Good point. Also, imo it was something to do in between college classes. Get their photo in the paper. The original attention whoring. Basically, they couldnâ€™t have given fuck all about Vietnam and civil rights, they were and are the bourgeoisie. It was just an excuse to do a shit ton of drugs and piss off their parents. Like every damn generation before them.
What happened to the older Boomers? I thought they were all from the love and peace generation? All the Buffalo Springfield protest songs? The 80s and cocaine really fucked them up.
