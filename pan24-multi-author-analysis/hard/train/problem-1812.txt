The funniest thing is the parents that think that if their kids never hear about sex, they will never have sex. Sorry but the body knows what to do. The only thing that happens is that they have to learn the hard way, which can be very hard when it comes to sex, involving disease, pregnancy, rape etc. etc.
I mean. There’s a difference right? I don’t agree with my kid being taught creationism because it’s an unproven idea someone had that has no bearing on reality.
They don’t want us to teach that gender is a social construct even though that is solidified by research and testing.
There's plenty of parents that don't want their kids taught about science, and the human body, and sex, etc. But ignoring those things doesn't make them any less factual or real.
But ultimately your comment is a false equivalence. Teaching religious doctrine or the manifesto of a failed, no-longer-existing traitor state is not the same as teaching sex education or the history of slavery.
I'm seeing this a programmer. Most of the kids entering my profession seem to have slept through computer science fundamentals - they're okay albeit inexperienced with things like JavaScript, but when it comes time to learn something like Go or Rust or write an OS they get completely lost.
