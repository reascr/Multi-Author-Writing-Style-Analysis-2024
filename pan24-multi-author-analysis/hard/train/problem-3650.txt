National debt is not like a credit card. It will likely always exist. It is much more important that the US remains a strong and stable power than lowering the debt. As long as that happens, our economy will be fine in the long run.
I'm not sure about that. I remember when the debt hit 1 trillion around 1990 and there were predictions that Social Security and medicare would be backrupt by 2000 and the US in general would be bankrupt by that point. It never happened. I'm not saying our debt is irrelevant, but it is not a priority to eliminate it. It is impirtant to keep an adequate debt to gdp ratio though.
I agree there is good debt and understand that a country’s debt is not the same as a persons. However a large amount of debt is held by borrowing from social security. I would rather them freeze social security rate increases now than doing a more extreme freeze in the future.
I’d rather fix the debt issue now than do the traditional leave it for the next generation to fix. Gen Z and millennials are already fucked. I’d prefer not to make it worse.
