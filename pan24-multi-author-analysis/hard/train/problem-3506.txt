They don’t have to be launched from Russia, very easily could have been from one of the many bases in the Middle East:
Benefit of balloons over spy satellites is they are less “predicable”, satellites rotation is known and can be “timed” to hide things if necessary. Balloons less so.
Balloons, first of all, are fuckin' cool. The Hindenburg incident occured because they were brilliant strategic weapons.
And vice versa. China has always tried to be the "strong, cold, mature man who runs the company at 22 and gets all the ladies". Hell, it's even a trope in their tv dramas. What they're very bad at is being human in front of the camera as a result. This is likely not a lie regarding US balloons, and from a geopolitical perspective it makes sense to remind the US that "hey, this isn't as stupidly bad as you make it out to be because your balloons are STILL floating around on our front lawn!".
Sure. But if what China says is true then if their radars could find them then I assume at least Russias could as well. If Chinas radars didn’t pick them up then how does China know they were there.
Redditors: ain't no way we would spy on China, that's just not something we do. We respect all the privacy and airspaces and balloons are really uncool too.
Wouldn’t that involve the balloons flying over countries like India or Russia, both of which I assume keep a pretty good eye on what’s in their airspace. I would assume a US balloon flying over multiple countries would have made the news.
