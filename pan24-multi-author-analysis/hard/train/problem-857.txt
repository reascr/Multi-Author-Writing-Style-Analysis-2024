One thing I've noticed while watching Benjam√≠n, the "Bald & Bankrupt" youtuber, is how little Russia outside the main cities has moved on from the Soviet era, while other eastern block nations (My wife is Polish) are showing signs of prosperity even in the most rural places.
We had enough of Russia breaking into small countries in the 50's here in Europe: in fact, most of my country's issues stem from these assholes occupying Eastern Europe for the better half of the last century.
100 years ago Russia could hide a lot of what they are doing right now and also spread a lot of lies about Ukraine that Ukraine would have trouble fighting as a smaller country with less resources.
Russia literally needs to steal land and forcfully abduct millions of people in order to survive with the territory they have now, otherwise they will balkanize in 50 years or less, they are a dying country.
depending on how things go, Russia is looking at a complete social collapse in some cities, literal mad max shit.
Russia: destroys self (they would be struggling even without sanctions, I want to mention this. The sanctions are just absolutely blasting them).
