For 45 years after WW2 the USSR blasted their population with propaganda how they are unbeaten righteous defenders against fascist through their determination and strenh.
And then Russia (USSR successor's) invade Ukraine with savage methods and rhetoric or racial superiority (calling Ukrainians pigs)....
You’re mistaken it’s because of Ukraine wanting to join NATO that started military training episodes, that then had to rid the nazis, to be able to find labs where the US was creating chemical weapons.
But even if I’m wrong, and the Ukranians violated those treaties first, “We had to invade Ukraine because they did not accept our earlier invasion of Ukraine” is only morally compelling to people who really, really want it to be.
In case anyone forgets, the Minsk deals themselves were only a thing because Russia rolled tanks into Crimea to illegally seize Ukrainian territory, and Ukraine did not have the means, and the West did not have the will, to stop it.
Are we just going to pretend that both former president of Ukraine and former chancellor of Germany have never publically said that Minsk agreements were just a way to buy time so that Ukraine can strenhen their army?
But this is also one of a smaller countries that I just use to back up my 'conspiracy theories'. So, according to this one conspiracy theory, Russia fires 20 000 shells a day, Ukraine (read: USA + the entirety of NATO alliance donated) fires some 4k-7k, which is 3 times less, but how? When GDP and military budget and other useless data used to impress no one?
