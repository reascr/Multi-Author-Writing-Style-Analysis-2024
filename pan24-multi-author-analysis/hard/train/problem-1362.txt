Just yesterday it was looking like Michigan. I could get behind Nevada, with my hesitation being how concentrated the voters are for Democrats in that state. Other than the payoff to Clyburn, I'm not sure I understand South Carolina as a good choice.
South Carolina doesn't feel like a strictly worse choice than Iowa, at least, but either Michigan or Nevada would have been much superior choices. Both states are still diverse and both states represent the kinds of environments the Democratic party is becoming, and needs to continue to be, competitive in.
If I were cynical I'd say that these are picked because they're all states that reliably vote for Third Way candidates because they can't have a repeat of 2020 where a progressive almost won.
Allowing states that will never swing for Democrats in a general election to have an outsized influence over the candidate that Democrats select for that election is political malpractice.
Reality is that SC is not breaking for Dems in the general whereas there are a number of states that have an even broader demographic cross section and that are actually competitive.
