Of course they can. Anybody with enough resources and support can do just about anything, including defeating the US military. Reference Vietnam and Afghanistan. Security is about making things more difficult to do to protect innocent people. You know it was ridiculously easy for the terrorists on 9/11 to do what they did right?
No idea what a LPR Is but if passports are being automated, that’s great. The Same level of security is being applied then as if they had obtained a passport. A drivers license and federal ID are different things. Drivers licenses can be Real ID compliant or not. There are 2 versions.
If you think so. However, terrorists are constantly looking for ways to attack America. There is a balance between freedom and security. What’s the harm in requiring people to meet certain requirements to get a federal ID when that ID is used for federally controlled forms of mass transportation when mass transportation has been used for successful terrorist attacks in the past? It’s already required to have a passport for international travel. Why is that required? A passport is really all about security.
How is that different from a passport? I don’t have a drivers license anymore because I’ve been overseas for twelve years and it expired. Oops. I don’t have to drive anymore lol. I’m thinking as long as I have a passport I’m good, but this is making me think not.
