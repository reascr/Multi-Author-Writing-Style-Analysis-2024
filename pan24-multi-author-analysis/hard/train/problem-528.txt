Calling yourself a libertarian is equivalent to saying you have the personal ethics and emotional development of a three year old and ignore your responsibilities to the community and country. In my book that is an idiot.
Libertarianism is the reason PA's roads look like shit because of the idiots that took that no new taxes pledge and the gas tax did not get raised for over ten years while the infrastructure was falling apart. There is no magic paving fairy.
Libertarianism is the magic thinking lie Reagan told that government is the problem because rich people hate paying taxes.
Libertarianism is not about rich people hating paying taxes. It is about freedom, and about the right for all people to live their lives according to their own ideals.
Libertarianism believes that all people should be free to live their lives according to their conscience, so long as they do not intrude with the rights of others.
Perhaps you have had bad experiences with some people who claim to be Libertarians, but that does not mean that you should judge them all in the same way. There are many kinds of people who call themselves Libertarians, and they all have different views.
