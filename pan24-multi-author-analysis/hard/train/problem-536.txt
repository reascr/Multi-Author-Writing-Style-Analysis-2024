Both things are true at the same time. The social factors that drive mass shootings and that drive more “normal” gun crime are entirely different, and require different prescriptions.
Note also that there are different definitions of mass shootings. ProPublica seems to use a very restrictive one, as they only counted 19 mass shootings in 60 years in Texas. What fraction of all homicides over the last 60 years is that?
From Pew Research, Handguns were used in 59% of the gun homicides in 2020. Weapons that would be categorized as "assault weapons" were used in 3% of gun homicides. Shotguns were used in 1%. The other 36% was classified as "type not stated".
Do you disagree? Statistics from Gun Violence Archive, a non profit that tracks gun violence in the US, show that about 705 people died from mass shootings in the US in 2021. This compares to a total of about 14,000 total gun homicides.
And there’s not that many mass shootings read the fbi statistics. They lump in gang activities in blue run states which blows the bell curve. This article is Gun grabber non sense.
