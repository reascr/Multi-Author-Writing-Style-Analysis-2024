Pfft, I’ve assembled an IKEA wardrobe on my own, send me out with a supply of Madonna CDs, I’ve got this!
Case in point, ask anyone who knows how to drive if they’ve ever read the driver’s manual to their car cover to cover. You would be amazed how many people would turn out to have skimmed it at most and couldn’t accurately tell you how many pages their car’s manual has to the nearest 100 pages.
(I joke with that last bit, but I genuinely have had to assemble an IKEA wardrobe on my own. 0/10, do not recommend unless you have a spare football field.).
Yup. We've got one potential enemy and that's Russia, we're going to be safer with these guns blowing up Russian T72s and protecting Europe then we would be with them in storage here.
Presumably the really clever part (that doesn't make the news) is the system that tracks incoming shells, works out where they came from, and sends the coordinates to the gunners faster than the Russians can move their gun. That's the bit I'd like to know about.
They don't always go for simultaneous impact. It's just something they can do sometimes, when the target isn't too far away.
