They have a proud history of rushing technology for the propaganda points. Not properly testing the technology. And it spectacularly failing. (But scapegoating the failures 'cos propaganda).
Russia always spread propaganda about their greatness and often overstretched themselves to failure. It's like there are cycles in Russia about bullshitting other countries into thinking they are all powerful until they believe it themselves and they try to invade a neighbor and then get their asses handed to them and they have to start over again. Also, those events usually coincide with revolution/regime change. Had Tsar Alexander and the war with Japan and the Soviets and their war in Afghanistan.
That would never happen in modern Russia, and it never happened in the USSR. It also doesn't happen in China. Authoritarian governments don't allow for that kind of open criticism of their mistakes.
Why the whataboutism though? The entire US space program has fewer killed than just one Russian accident. China has no published figures on losses, despite frequently dropping empty rockets on their own people. We know a single Long March test may have killed as many as 100 Chinese people. Is there a Wikipedia article detailing every failure of a single Chinese space flight/program?
The N1 rocket program, their Moon rocket for manned missions, was an abject failure. 4 launches, 4 failures, one of which blew up on the bad and caused massive delays for the next launch attempt.
