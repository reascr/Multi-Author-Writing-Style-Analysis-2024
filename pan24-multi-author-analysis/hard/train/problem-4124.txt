I’m so sorry this is happening to your country. You’ve all been through way too much shit. My close friend is second generation to a mother who immigrated from Lebanon. My friend works hard and always thinks of others, because fortune from hard work brings a humble and kind attitude. I wish the people who’ve been betrayed by oligarchs can get their moral back. I know it happened to America in the 1920’s, and my grandmother recanted stories about when she was a child. Long story short, it was horrible. We need to get the UN to bring aid to Lebanon.
I'm talking about Lebanon. They had massive power outages but technology did not collapse. Grocery stores did not go out of business. Life still continued. And paper dollars are still used.
I don't know why you'd want to store millions in cash. It's always better to invest it in something. People who have millions in Lebanon most likely keep it in a Swiss bank or some other EU/US/Emirates bank.
You can also trade currency with a bank account that is not in Lebanon. Buying euros or dollars with that account would be much more stable than bitcoins.
There are Bitcoin services that automatically convert to fiat for you, when you pay. They don't have to accept Bitcoin.
