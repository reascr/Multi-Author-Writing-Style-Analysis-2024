They're actually not blaming Ukraine (as much) this time around - the anger seems to be more directed at their own commanders, and their incompetence.
Well, not quite - they're not questioning what they were doing in Ukraine, moreso what they were doing in that specific building, which was a terrible tactical move.
We are pissed that, after our relentlessly bombing their infrastructure and their civilian centers, the Ukranians are killing our soldiers How inhumane of them.
Having your army act as "separatist forces," hiding them amongst civilians, and then screaming about "atrocities" committed against Russians by the defending army is not legitimate. Maybe if we didn't see Russian army AA guns shoot down a passenger jet we might have ... no, no we wouldn't. Everyone sees what Russia did. No one wants this "move your army in and pretend they're local volunteers" to become a legitimate way to seize territory. No one but your own population buys this "self-defense" garbage, and I bet most of them don't even buy it around the kitchen table. There it's "our country, right or wrong," and "for the love of God, keep your head down.".
When is Russia going to understand that the world doesn't buy this bullshit? Moving your army into a internationally recognized borders is not legitimate, even if you take the insignia off of their uniforms. Especially if you initially claim that you had nothing to do with those soldiers, and then a couple months later gleefully take credit for them.
