Minsk has nothing to do with Russia, it's Ukraine's internal affair. And russia's bullshit propaganda about it is no excuse for invasion. None of that changes that russia is a terrorist state.
Russia is a terrorist state because they are targeting civilians in the war russia started, and Minsk was a result of russia starting wars in Eastern Ukraine.
Minsk 1 and 2 was an attempt to get the Ukrainian government and army to stop shelling it's own civilians in Donbas, and as you correctly pointed out killing civilians is terrorism. Russia maybe a terrorist state, but not for the reasons you give.
Like, even if this war was going well for Russia, this would still be disastrous on the world stage, even for their “allies.”.
What nation, what investor is going to go to Russia when they can and have backtracked on their statements in as little as a handful of hours?
They’ve agreed and then reneged on their national promises more times than I can count immediately after making said promise. I’m talking about the corridors, peace talks, grain deal, hell, I’ll throw this whole war in as well considering how moronic it is that this is even happening, and that’s just off the top of my head.
