Weren't there tons of stipulations on nations accepting the Marhshall Plan aid regarding their defense capabilities? That would appeal mainly to nations that were truly obliterated. While Russia appears to be losing this thing, domestically they may be fucked, but not post WWII Japan/Germany levels of fucked.
We keep reading that Russia has suffered Strategic defeat, but they are still fighting and no end in sight. Strategic is nonsense, there needs to be tactical defeats, so Russians realise they can't continue. This is where NATO urgently must to step up to the plate and either join or give Ukraine all of the advanced support it needs. Russia will not suffer, but will just retire to its legitimate borders, Ukraine and the West can then get on with fixing our world.
Given the issues they face... blaming Putin, withdrawing, and showing willingness to work with the West is the smartest course of action.
The real issue is that Russia is supressing a lot of discord within and without its borders. We're going to have flare-ups of regional issues so old, people will not even be familiar with them.
When Putin goes, there's going to be some other figure that steps up and replaces him. Putin failing will not be seen so much as a failure of the system, as Putin having run his course and needing to be replaced.
I've heard the Russian system described well as that you're allowed to have total power, but instead you have to show that you will protect the nation.
The wider issue is those in power in Moscow that cling to the notion Russia is entitled to be a superpower.... & deserves to take, by force, whatever resources necessary to bring about USSR 2.0.
