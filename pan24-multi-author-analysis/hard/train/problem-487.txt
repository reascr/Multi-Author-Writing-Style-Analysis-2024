There was never an Indian empire. It was always muslims ruling the subcontinent. The Mughals ruled it for 1000 years after that the British took over. So there was only the muslim and British empire in subcontinent no Indian empire of any sort.
What is modern day Tamil Nadu and Kerala was never part of the Mughal empire - either as territory or as vassals. They were only conquered twice by outside forces in their history - by Malik Kafur in the 13th century and by the British.
Extremely ignorant comment. The Mughals were not even the first muslim empire. Northern India and present day Pakistan were under muslim rule for over 300 years before Babur.
You might want to read up on the Guptas, Mauryans etc and the various Southern empires. For over 2000 years there were indigenous empires, some of where were more powerful than the Mughals.
The Marathas were vassals under the Bijapur sultanate - not the Mughals. When Aurangzeb invaded the Deccan, the Marathas used that opportunity to rebel and break free.
Its not that Aurangzeb never conqured them it was that they were once part of the empire but they rebelled . Thats why he fought a long exhausting war against the Marathas and thats true that war went no where.
