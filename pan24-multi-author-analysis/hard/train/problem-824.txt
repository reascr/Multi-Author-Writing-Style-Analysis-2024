Weird claim that Vegas was a one time thing when there are mass shootings literally every year. Just the year before that was Pulse nightclub with 50 deaths. In fact just about every year there's a mass shooting with 15+ killed, and nearly all of them used an AR-15. It's very clearly the weapon of choice for mass murder.
To me, that is still a mass shooting. In most of the rest of the world, 3 people getting shot in any circumstances would be a mass shooting. The only reason Americans think otherwise is because they have been so desensitized to gun violence that "only" 3 people being shot seems insignificant to them.
It's sad that there is so much gun violence in the US that "only" 3 people getting shot doesn't qualify as a mass shooting.
Let's also not forget that there are years like 2017 when 60 people were killed and over 400 wounded in just a single shooting with AR pattern rifles.
36 isnâ€™t bad when you think of the thousands who die every year in the states due to firearms, which includes AR15 deaths.
20 million guns and those guns were responsible for a total of 36 deaths in the year so far in a nation of 330 million people.
I mean it's sad when anyone dies unnecessarily but I feel like 20 million guns that can only be associated with 36 total deaths across 9 months is not that bad all things considered. Still.
