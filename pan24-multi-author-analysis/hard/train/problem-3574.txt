Check out the OP's account. It's an 8 year account with no posts until yesterday, where it already submitted 12 posts (all news articles, 7 from BusinessInsider). The comments started yesterday too.
No dude, that's BusinessInsider. Somebody is paying them to write articles against Meta, and then they're botting to submit it to reddit (where it influences public opinion).
Reddit has a comment section where people can at least call out bullshit (except for flair-restricted rightwing subs).
There's plenty of content on Reddit that is dishonest and meant to shape public opinion, but it's FAR more regulated than the size of the purse you can give zuck.
You can go on reveddit to know who is trying to control narratives. You've described what right-wing misinformation campaigns do, while attributing all actions to democrats.
Then again, it might be that you've addressed something which actually represents a factual blind spot that irritates party loyalists.
The catch, though, is whether or not you've truly called out bullshit or you're attempting to insert widely debunked talking points gleaned from, say the alt-right conspiracy sphere.
