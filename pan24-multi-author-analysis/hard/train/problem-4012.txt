Russians will stop bombing once there's a lot of NATO cargo planes and relief personnel in the city, because if they keep going and hit any of those, that's the excuse we need to actually join the war and finally deal with Russia.
It's even more stupid that Ukraine must beg for something defensive in nature - like Anti-Air systems in enough numers - and only get them AFTER start of the bombing campaing.
They have to beg because air defense was always seen as less important than fighters for NATO countries, which is why they barely have enough for themselves, so there's not much left to send to Ukraine, and they can't produce enough new systems in time.
The USSR went the opposite way and focused on disrupting enemy air superiority rather than gaining it, which is why Ukraine inherited large stockpiles of various SAM systems.
Ukraine needs more air and missile defense systems so that fewer Russian missiles get through and then Ukraine needs more heavy weapons (plus training) to drive Russia out of their land as well as more sanctions to disrupt the Russian war machine and make it harder to fund the war.
What is needed is a large amount of air defense to counter those attacks, the ability to conduct long-range strikes deep into russia to destroy stockpiles of missiles, airfields etc, and strikes against Iran to prevent production and shipping of those drones.
