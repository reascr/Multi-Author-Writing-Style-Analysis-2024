Not impossible, as there are still legal methods (like a successful objection to electoral votes). What the reform act does is close some of the loopholes that existed because there wasn't clarification in existing law (like what actually count as official state electors and what's the role of the VP?).
The most likely ruling, if the recent arguments are any indication, wont be a wholesale "state legislatures can do whatever they want", but something more along the lines of "Courts can invalidate state laws but not impose their own rules" (like appointing a special team to create district maps).
More specifically whether they can be limited by the courts and the (state) executive. Legislatures already have the Constitutional power to determine the "times, places, and manner" of holding elections. The question to the Court is "Whether a Stateâ€™s judicial branch may nullify the regulations governing "Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives" prescribed by the Legislature and replace them with regulations of the state courts' own devising". Basically, can a state court overrule an election-related law and impose their own set of rules?
Updatung US election law is significant. This is to prevent another Jan 6th. This is a huge blow to election deniers and MAGA that were trying to undermine US elections and democracy.
And all of Trump's election denying candidates lost badly in the midterms. It almost feels like our American democracy might survive this far right authoritarian movement.
It makes it impossible for a repeat of the Jan 6th coup attempt. Trump tried to get the VP and others to refuse the certification of Biden as president and Trump nearly pulled it off but VP pence refused and certified Biden after the Capitol was secured.
