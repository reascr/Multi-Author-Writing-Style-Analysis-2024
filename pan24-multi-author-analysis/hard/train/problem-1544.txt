Would they really fire my wife? probably not. But it is like OP said, it's a way to scare employees into submission. When the rule book says 5 strikes you're fired, you come into work with a disease on your 5th occurrence. Or at least, a lot of people do.
its a similar situation. The bonuses early this year were insane. You could make 800 bucks EXTRA in 1 days shift, and that short of stuff lasted for months. They are attempting to reel back the bonuses but the shortage remains, and the hospital remains full.
My wife's hospital operates in a similar way and she's a nurse, and it's ridiculous. She gets occurrences for sick days. I believe if you get 5 in a year, you may be terminated. What results is nurses come in sick, which is literally life threatening to patients. The nation needs nationalized protected sick day rights. not only for workers but just to make the country more functional, less sick.
So she works in the place where sick people go when they’re sick and then gets in trouble when she gets sick from being around all the sick people….
