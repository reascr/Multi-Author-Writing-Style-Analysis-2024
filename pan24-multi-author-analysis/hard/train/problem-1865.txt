I'm not Israeli but from what I've seen, the Israeli system isn't ideal either. They have a parliamentary system with a ton of parties and you need to hit a minimum threshold to get seats in the Knesset.
Actually if you look at the popular vote in the recent election, it's pretty 50/50 if you look at it from a pro Bibi/Anti Bibi POV. Granted the anti Bibi coalition involves everyone from some center right to far left to anti Zionist Arab parties. So not the most stable coalition itself. But it does go to show that the country isn't as black and white as "OMG ALL ISRAELIS SUPPORT FAR RIGHT POLITICS".
Because Netanyahu doesn't even get 1/4 of the votes, but this is how Israeli democracy works. In the same way I can ask how Bush became president without wining more than half the votes in 2000. Yes it is a little more drastic here, but that's what happens when you have so many parties.
1) they somehow have 8 kids but yet some religious parties still don't make it over 7 mandates? Just look at UTJ in Israel over the years. Their community AVERAGES 7 or 8 kids per couple and yet they have never made it over 7 mandates. It is a big question in Israeli politics to answer why, but one theory is that many vote for non-religious parties or don't vote at all (a lot of them don't recognize the Israeli government on principle, so won't vote, it's a question how many).
I was just pointing out that Israel's parliamentary system has its own flaws as well that can lead to disproportionate representation when compared to strict majority popular vote.
Israel votes left, Israel attempts peace/negotiates with a terrorist government, it blows up in their face spectacularly, Israelis vote right. Palestinians suffer. Repeat.
And say whatever you want. The Jews are absolutely right, if they lay down their arms, they would be slaughtered.
