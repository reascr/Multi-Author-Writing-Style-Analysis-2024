That ratio just keeps getting further skewed as the war continues. At the start Ukraine lost a lot more men than they are now and Russia's losses have increased as the war continues.
this is a war, ukraine and russia are both heavily engaged in propaganda as that is part of war. you gotta read a little bit between the lines and try to make reasonable assumptions of where the truth lies.
people gotta learn to separate their opinion and desires from the reality of things, and also be able to recognize when they simply dont know what exactly is going on.
redditors really struggle with parsing information in general, no matter the topic, because whenever its information they'd rather not be true they will be extremely critical of it and make every assumption possible that the information is bad in one way or another, but when it is information that aligns with their opinion they will assume it is so true that it is probably even better than what the information said.
its also worth keeping in mind that up until october or so there were more casualties on the ukrainian side than the russian side, by a decent margin. russia started "losing" when it comes to casualties around then, before that ukraine was "losing" on that end.
Paraphrasing: Yes, Ukrainan losses are fewer than the russian but we lose our best and russia loses their worst.
There's a reason why non-Ukrainian estimates are about 2-3x lower than Ukraine's, and it's not because Ukraine's is more accurate.
There's a reason why Ukraine's estimated enemy kills is about 2-3x higher than everybody else's, and it's not because Ukraine's is more accurate.
I fully support Ukraine, but I'm getting sick of the highest propaganda numbers being paraded around as fact. It's a law of warfare that you overestimate how many enemies you kill and underestimate how many of your own soldiers died. It's been happening since at least the ancient Greeks.
