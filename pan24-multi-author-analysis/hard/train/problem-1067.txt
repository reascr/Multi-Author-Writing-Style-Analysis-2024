There is this thing called history. Territorial boundaries are easy, but cultural boundaries are not. Lots of places in Europe have cultures that overlap territorial boundaries. The Crimea and Ukraine are just one.
You should probably look at the history of Crimea. It isn't really so simple. Crimea was mostly Russians for the past 100 years and few Ukrainians. Even before the USSR Crimea wasn't very populated by Ukrainians.
During the USSR Kruschev added Crimea to Ukraine but it didn't really matter since it was the USSR. Following the dissolution of the USSR there were many Russians, and the population of Crimea was mostly Russians who were left unable to return home. Crimea attempted twice in the 90s to become independent from Ukraine with the intention of returning to be part of Russia.
What are your thoughts on Crimea seeking twice in the 90s to declare independence from Ukraine and Ukraine denying their independence? The intention was for Crimea to return to Russia at that point by way of Crimean self-determination.
I think the real tricky question is what to do with the ethnic Russians who lived in Crimea before Russia's annexation. They were Ukrainian citizens and legally probably still are.
You're right to point out the fact that even before USSR Ukrainians were a minority in Crimea. You curiously omit the glaring fact that before the USSR Russians were not a majority in Crimea as well - judging by 1897 census data at least. The majority - Crimean Tatars - were cultivating much longer ties to that land than Russians can claim. Should we give the peninsula back to Tatars, by this logic?
