As many of you know, there currently is a near total ban on education of females that goes beyond the university ban.
There is not one single other country, regardless of religion or race or class, that completely ban its female population from studying. Not even what we'd deem the most conservative countries (e.g. Saudi?). That's how nuts these Talib guys are.
The problem is there is no single person who hasn't had a friend or family member affected in some way by war, whether it was death or disabilities (often by the millions of Soviet planted landmines). It's like a scar that the folks there carry. I've read countless of Afghan war and life stories that are just beautiful (most famously The Kite Runner).
Keep in mind theocracy is ambiguous in terms of what they agree on. Almost all want a religious state but otherwise most are not in favor of how the Taliban views it.
Unfortunately, this might actually be what some of the Taliban wants. They aren't fond of Western style education for anyone and getting the whole system to implode might be seen as a good thing by them.
