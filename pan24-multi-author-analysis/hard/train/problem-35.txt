Making the latter have some skin in the game helps facilitate them showing up, and is a far more common scenario in the criminal justice system that the billionaire fleeing the country on his yacht.

Shouldn't you prove that your desired policy (cash bail) actually serves whatever purpose it's intended to? You can let yourself off the hook by saying you can't prove a negative if you want, but it doesn't make whatever case you're hoping to make any stronger. In either case I'm not invested in whatever you're saying, and not making any claims, so I'm not expecting you to prove anything at all.
