This is exactly what I meant. He's got a cult following. His only real accomplishment was that minor political scuffle. But people eat his dick like it's going out of style. He's made absolutely gobs of money off of his culture war bullshit.
Shit, after that I could probably write a shitty book and make millions of dollars. That's how things work in the US and Canada at least. Look at Jordan Peterson. He was a nearly completely unknown professor until he had a minor political battle with his university over pronouns, now he's some sort of fucking cult hero. Guy constantly rants about 'free speech' and how the entire West is collapsing and he's being oppressed. Call us when you get 15yrs in prison for dancing, Jordo.
As shitty as the US feels sometimes, things like this make me grateful that I live here. I could call the president an asshole to his face, and show him my whole dick, balls and ass, and I'd just get fined and spend a couple nights in jail. If that.
yeah, but only once in a while. It is generally safer to be black in the USA than to be eg. white in Namibia Zimbabwe.
