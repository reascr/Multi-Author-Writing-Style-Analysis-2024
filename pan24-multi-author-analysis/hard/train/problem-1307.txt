The Trump nuts that don’t have this stance are too far gone. Lost causes. But anyone with a shred of common sense would agree if crimes were committed lock his ass up. Nobody is or should be above laws.
Very aware yes. I know people who voted for Trump (the first time he ran) who also think he should be locked up for any wrong doing. Reddit isn’t the real world. Anyone in reality with any shred of common sense would agree Trump should go to prison if he broke the law. Biden should too for that matter.
For Biden, it remains to be seen. So far he has returned all of the documents that we know that he knew that he had, immediately. Where he can run into problems is.
So in the case of Hillary, for example, there was classified material, but the question was whether she should have had a separate server. That, if irregular, could be something like gross negligence. It turns out that it was not irregular. Or in the case of the other clauses, if she intentionally withheld the material after knowing it was classified, or any of the other things, then it becomes illegal. It turns out nothing she did qualified as illegal, although maybe ill advised.
