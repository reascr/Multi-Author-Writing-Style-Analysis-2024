He'd have to convince the Republicans and their friends in the Military Industrial Complex to lose out on all those NATO military sales. Not going to happen.
I think Putin was waiting to see if Trump won reelection and, when that failed, whether Trump would bring the entire U.S. government down with his "Big Lie" campaign. Plus, he probably had to wait for spring to launch his invasion. (I hear Ukraine is a tad chilly during the winter.).
Okay. So the suggestion is that Putin didn't see a Trump led NATO/ United States as a threat and therefore there was no need to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine.
So yes, it's entirely possible Putin saw an increase threat from NATO and US under the Biden White House - more so than when Trump was President.
This headline makes me feel like some evidence will soon come to light that Trump explicitly told Putin to bomb Ukraine or supported the idea of it.
If those things are all true, I have yet to hear a logical explanation as to why Putin waited until Trump was out of office before he launched the invasion? It just makes no sense.
Ah yes. Schrodingers idiot. Biden is a bumbling, incompetent, and senile old man but also clever enough to argue with a dictator who was in the KGB for years.
