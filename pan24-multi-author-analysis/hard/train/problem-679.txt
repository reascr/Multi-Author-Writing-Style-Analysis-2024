"My sight is failing," she said finally. "Even when I was young I could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they used to be, Benjamin?".
Yes. There are criminal offenses the DOJ could prosecute. But, this post is about disqualifying a congressman from serving and that is not a criminal case. I suppose if they are convicted of sedition their disqualification should follow. But who imposes it or enforces it?
So, does someone need to sue to have this applied to those 34 members of Congress? Or, is this something only congress can enforce against its own members? Or it is something the governor or legislature of the Congressman's home state can do? The GOP seems to want state legislatures to control elections so maybe they'd get on board with that.
But I'm sure the congressmen in the crosshairs would say "Separation of powers. Executive branch has no say over internal workings of the legislature. Also, DOJ only enforces criminal laws which this isn't." dollars to doughnuts they'll say the same thing when someone sues them. "Separation of powers, judicial branch cant do anything about internal workings of the legislative branch.".
The way the Courts are these days, it would be a shame if someone filed 34 suits in the home states of each of those congressman, and some of them were removed or resigned and control of congress returned to the Democrats.
The US constitution states that it takes a two-thirds majority from both chambers of Congress to disable (stop) such criminal indictments from being applied to these members of Congress.
Thus, one-third of the members of Congress can't stop such indictments from occurring; it takes a two-thirds majority (in both chambers of Congress) to prevent such criminal indictments from taking effect.
