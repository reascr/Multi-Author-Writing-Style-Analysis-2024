Tbf I have been told that near the beginning of the vaccines in China they were causing problems but now they aren’t anymore,so that’s positive at least.
China's vaccination rate is way to low to achieve any kind of herd immunity and if it's a new variant, what protection they do have is pretty much limited to preventing death, not the disease.
Well as far as the rest of the world goes they basically have zero immunity so it's unlikely whatever mutation comes out of china will evade western vaccines.
The only nasty thing that could come from this for people not in China is new variants that are somehow more severe and/or evade our existing immunity too much.
Keep in mind that China has way worse immunity than the West. We've basically let COVID (and especially Omicron) burn through the population in a semi-controlled fashion. As a result, many people have already had it once or even multiple times. On top of that we have mRNA vaccines which are way more effective at reducing the severity of infection. What you're seeing now is the result of China's zero COVID policy suddenly being stopped, unleashing a tidal wave on their population.
