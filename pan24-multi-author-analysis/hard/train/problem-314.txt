Meanwhile the truth is that ALL presidents sell off some of the reserves. Gas has a limited shelf life, and they need to rotate stock, so they sell some off and then replenish it.
IIRC, Trump said this part out loud in an interview. "Well, I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.".
thanks, that's what I meant. I've been meaning to post in r/personalfinance because I'm wondering if I'd be better off with one account getting 6% rather than two getting 3% each.
I'm not so young (37) but I am just starting my first real career after making poverty wages throughout my thirties. I'm making 60K and I have two retirement accounts, one is a 401K and the other is a Roth IRA. Each one gets a 3% contribution from my wages so something like $62.50 out of each check goes into each account. My employer does not match any of these contributions. I will probably have nowhere near enough to retire on.
I’m not going to retire. Who the fuck am I kidding? The world’s gonna catch on fire by the time I hit 90 or whatever the Republicans have made the retirement age in 50 years.
So I’m in my 40s and this is just an observation - the Republican brand has gotten more dumb, the older I’ve become. I could have sworn all the salty codgers I used to work with said, “as you get older, you’ll get more Republican” - this must have been back when Republicans were capable of critical thinking.
