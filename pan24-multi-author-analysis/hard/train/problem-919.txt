You should check it out again. I have been watching a little since stumbling upon a ladder match promo months ago, and my brother has fully gotten back into it like when we were kids. The women are amazing, and I wish they would have been around when I was a little girl. It's hitting different these days.
The GOP acts like Vince McMahon is running the show, and it's wild how much they act like WWE performers. I wonder if any culture war bullshit is backlash from WWE being more progressive.
Slightly related: I always thought WWE (or back in my day it was known as WWF) was pretty lame. Then I went to a luchador match in Mexico and my friend explained why he loved it so much. It really is just a long running performance done by dedicated professionals. Still not into WWE, but I kind of get it now.
That goes even further back before they changed to WWE. VKM testified in 1989 that wrestling is a work so he could avoid paying taxes that were levied against athletic competitions in certain states.
