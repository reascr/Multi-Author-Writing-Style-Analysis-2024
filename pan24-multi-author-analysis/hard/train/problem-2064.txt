Very high chance the team deemed these two documents as low risk to their client and destroyed all the rest they found there, it’s idiotic to think there was only two documents in that container, there was absolutely more the two handed over were just a distraction.
The right would have a field day with this but this actually sounds like something shitty he would do, the government will never be allowed to do it so I’m guessing some private citizens might figure shit out and dig it up if it isn’t under guard, if it is there are absolutely documents there.
They were also not found by any government agency such as the FBI, they were found by a team trump has hired and paid, there was absolutely more documents there, the two they gave up probably aren’t very incriminating while the others are and were most likely destroyed in the search.
Can you fucking imagine if the FBI had reason to believe you were illegally holding classified documents, and you were allowed to hire your own team to search for them?
Trump legal team logic: let's hire some uncleared private investigators to search for classified documents they are not authorized to handle. Whoever they are in contact with at DoJ must be gobsmacked at the stupidity.
