Actual partisan republicans I've known have established that the Trump nepotism was fine, because they weren't going against "order"\, but the mere hint that maybe Biden helped his son with a business deal is a huge deal because they think if he was able, he'd disrupt order.
(\ yes. It is deeply amusing/frustrating that they also have enough cognitive dissonance to like Trump because he disrupted order. But part of that also comes from them thinking "he was reorganising things to be more how we want it". I do miss the days when they'd stop talking there though, rather than having to admit out loud that they wish they could be more of a bigot).
Most people read that and think law is the important part. Often the people you're talking about view 'order' as the important part.
I think it's that down to their fundamental core being they believe that that "Law" and "Order" is for everyone else. Its ok if I do it. I can break these little laws(perspective re:little: trespassingdriving how "I" wanttax fraudvoter fraud, storm the Capitol) it's not a big deal. Basically Entitlement.
