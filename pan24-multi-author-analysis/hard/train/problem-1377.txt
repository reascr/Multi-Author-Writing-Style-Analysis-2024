It would be the state legislature, not the judiciary. It would put all power surrounding elections into the hands of the state legislature and, in some cases, SCOTUS.
Why have a judicial system if legislatures can decide? Somehow, it seems autocratic but who am I to object? Also, by avoiding a ruling on red state gerrymandering, the Supreme Court handed control of the House to republicans.
North Carolinians have relied on courts and my veto power as governor to foil many of these schemes. In 2022 a successful lawsuit in state court challenging a 2021 gerrymandered congressional map resulted in fair districts, splitting the state’s 14 districts (the state gained a district after the 2020 census) so that Democrats and Republicans each won seven seats in November’s elections. It seemed only right, given the nearly even divide between Democratic and Republican votes statewide. Republican efforts to avoid this result led to the Moore v. Harper appeal now before the Supreme Court.
Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has been the governor of North Carolina since 2017. He was previously elected to four terms as attorney general.
