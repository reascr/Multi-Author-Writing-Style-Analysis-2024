The Iowa Gop also introduced House File 508 which “says no resident of Iowa "shall be compelled, coerced, or forced to recognize any same-sex unions or ceremonies as marriage,”.
Also, RFMA only says Iowa has to respect marriages performed in other states regardless of its own stupid laws, it doesn't do anything to stop Iowa from passing whatever stupid laws they want to persecute Iowans with.
And I know the summary says that it forces states to honor out of state marriages, but I would be surprised if there's not language that specifically protects against state level bans like this - state level bans on abortion were a big part of why there was a push to pass RFMA to begin with.
H.R.8404 "replaces provisions that do not require states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states with provisions that prohibit the denial of full faith and credit or any right or claim relating to out-of-state marriages on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin. (The Supreme Court held that state laws barring same-sex marriages were unconstitutional in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015; the Court held that state laws barring interracial marriages were unconstitutional in Loving v. Virginia in 1967.) The act allows the Department of Justice to bring a civil action and establishes a private right of action for violations.".
A ban would still be a 14th Amendment violation. And RFMA would still prevent the Iowa state government from prosecuting couples who married out of state. Both of those laws would seem to completely invalidate any sort of ban on same sex marriage.
They also want to pass a bill to prohibit the recognition of the respect of marriage act in the state.
This law would be in direct violation of H.R.8404 - The Respect for Marriage Act, which Biden signed into law back in December.
