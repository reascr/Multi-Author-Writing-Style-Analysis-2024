You forget that it was/is to Russia's benefit to show that they can keep the peace in their sphere of influence. That's something only great powers can do and Russia is desperate to be seen as a great power.
Russia has been pulling back from the world and focusing its attention on Ukraine. A few months after the war clearly wasn't going well they pulled their entire presence from Syria. They don't have anything spare to handle other nation's conflicts anymore.
Not quite. It was done to give Russia geopolitical allies on its borders and maintain existing trade relationships. But the relationship has always been Russia sending in troops to help its allies, and never its allies sending in troops to help them. If there was no war in Ukraine there would also be no conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Russia would have sent troops to Armenia to push the Azerbaijanis back.
And even though armenia is reliant on the CSTO do to Turkish-Azerbaijani aggression - is Russia doing anything for them? Azerbaijan with the support of turkey literally controls actual Armenian territory, with Russia just giving thoughts and prayers. Armenias own CSTO ally Kazakhstan supports Azerbaijan in its war against it.
The CSTO is such a useless alliance. Even Kazakhstan gave up on it when it started sharing CSTO intelligence with turkey and turkey planning to establish drone manufacturing facilities in Kazakhstan. It even supported Azerbaijan in its war with Armenia and is looking to escape Russias influence over its energy sector by talking with Azerbaijan over building a pipeline.
Not really, Iran is quite friendly to Armenia, and has implied that it will come to Armenia's defense should it face increased Azerbaijani aggression.
