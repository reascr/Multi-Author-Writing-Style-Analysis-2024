"Nuclear capable" applies to a huge portion of Russia's missile systems - it turns out that being able to nuke people is really important in modern warfare.
However, if Russia decides to lob a (Short Range or Intermediate Range) ballistic nuclear weapon or use heavy conventional bombers, a Patriot battery will eat their lunch.
Patriot is also capable of shooting down missiles, not just aircraft, which helps with reducing the civilian casualties from Russia's missile barrages.
Most cruise missiles and aircraft can be shot down by the various things Ukraine has now, but Patriot missile sites give them the capability to defend against some of the really nasty stuff.
I think that's the big message being sent - Ukraine is being given the best anti-ballistic missile system, which has real combat experience backing it up.
Giving Ukraine Patriot missiles gives them a way to defend against a pre-emptive nuclear attack while gaining zero offensive capability. I'm not surprised that Russia is pissed off - they've lost one of their biggest threats now.
