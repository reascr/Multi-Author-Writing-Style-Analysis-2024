Only a barbarian would destroy art, regardless of its origin. To say that you want to destroy Russian art echos of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Two wrongs don't make a right.
Sure. What I understand you're saying is that as long as it's art from "not Russia", it needs to be protected from destruction. Or perhaps you are saying that putler sees foreign art as more valuable, since you want to be disparaging to Russian art by the virtue of it being Russian. Or perhaps when you are saying "not Russia" you are referring to stolen Ukrainian art, that might be in the palace.
If Putin's mansion blew up and that somehow saved Ukrainian lives I would value that over the Russian artworks. If I created art and 100 years from now my country invaded another for illegitimate reasons I would be happy if its destruction was in the pursuit of justice, I would rather my work burnt to a cinder than be in such a persons hands as Putin's.
Does it now? Go ahead and quote the part where I said anything about encouragement to attack Russia or its art?
3) The war is not very popular in Russia, propaganda notwithstanding. Volunteers dried up, the exodus of young educated men happened, one round of mobilization happened, another is incoming. It is HARD to estimate the effect of morale, but the last thing Ukraine wants to do is hand Putin an energizant for the 60% or so "meh, whatever" russians. Complacency, petty corruption, malicious or weaponized incompetence and negligence has a pervasive and important effect to a war effort.
2) The West wrote a book on conducting war, and they expect it to be followed, else the populations would chafe at the support the west gives Ukraine. Hopefully Ukraine understands that democratic leaders are bound by what their constituents want. Not only weapons, but economic pressure and diplomatic pressure on Russia is what Ukraine gets if it acts according to the "rules".
