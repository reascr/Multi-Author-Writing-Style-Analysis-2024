An incredibly unqualified partisan gifted a lifetime appointment by a man with a life of corruption and the judge makes a horrendously corrupt ruling for that same man.
So basically, let corruption judges get away with favorable ruling for their benefactors otherwise it might be weponized to go after progressive judges.
The story doesn't even demonstrate the point that removing a judge for terrible judgements is in any way bad for democracy or the judicial system, it just asserts it (again). And they’re not even comparable cases. The outlined story suggests the judge was following the letter of the law. Cannon was clearly being partial and bending law, even to the extent that the 11th circuit said she was reinterpreting the constitution.
What am I really supposed to take away from this? Oh shucks, someone else in history said punishing a judge for bad decisions is bad so it must be bad in every case?
They really defended Cannon’s terrible judgement with a story of a judge who sentenced a fugitive slave to be sent back to slavery?
