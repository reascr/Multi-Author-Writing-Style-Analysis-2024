Brazil is such a corrupt country that they would just pocket the fee and cut the forests down anyways. The government needs to pay the indigenous tribes to manage it. Just because other countries made a mistake in managing their resources doesn't mean others have to as well. We've progressed long enough to have enough history and evidence for land management to be cut down forests > grow cows and soybeans > maybe replant.
Just because one country made a mistake doesn't mean it's wise for another country to do the same. It is more profitable in the long run for permaculture over monoculture. Europe's forests are slowly coming back but to have the Amazon cut down will decimate our climate.
The massive European forests are gone. That's a fact and nothing can change that without time travel. But what's also another fact? Other forests are still here, so there's still a chance to save them.
On top of all that, Europe did cut their forests when the knowledge of agriculture was basic. Now we know a lot about it and have technology that our ancestors couldn't even dream of. There's no reason to cut down forests anymore.
Europe hasn't been a big-ass primeval forest since 11,000 years ago. By the end of the Bronze age 3,000 years ago almost all primeval forest was gone. So you're saying the EU should fund your deforestation today because otherwise we're hypocrites with our prehistoric forefathers? Pfff.
