They're saying the quite part loud. They eventually plan on invading and making public statements implying there is a significant number of Russians living in Moldova means they should be running it.
That's funny because it's the same argument that nefarious actors made for these regions of Ukraine that Russia invaded in 2014 or has been encroaching on and pumping propaganda into for years.
So I see stuff about Ukraine doing some fucked up shit coming out of the Russian camp, and have no real way to combat it since every other source I see is so blatantly pro-Ukraine that I can't call it "Unbiased".
Here's a sub full of pro Ukranians that often post eastern European news from Balkan nations directly effected or in direct support of Ukraine in this conflict along with nightly announcements from Ukraines DOD and President.
But the coverage of the Ukranian war (to me) has felt extremely similar to coverage of US Military actions. Generally pushing a narrative that The [US/Ukraine] Military never loses, it's all wins all the time, we're the best, nobody ever dies except the bad guys, nobody ever commits any war crimes, and they're all chivalrous Knights in shining armor fighting "For Truth and Justice".
