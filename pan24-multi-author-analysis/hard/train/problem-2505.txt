Have you considered why those areas are unstable? Perhaps due to intervention from the countries and lineages that took said artifacts? A good chunk of Americans have ancestry linked to the Crusades, for instance.
Right now, many countries have to use facsimiles or images/models because the originals are held in the British Museum or other museums. Literally, they will just have the feet and the rest is a model because the Brits chopped it off at the ankles and hauled it away. They were the ones who destroyed the artifact first, returning it to the rightful owners is in my opinion the right thing to do ( but you have the right to your own opinion, I appreciate this conversation 😊).
Unless you’d feel fine with every single museum being emptied so all their artefacts could be destroyed by their source nations because “it’s their property and right as owners”.
It’s important to teach history, and the best way to do so is to have it right there to look at and learn from. Seeing a piece in a museum is vastly different to seeing an image online, or even a 3D model, no matter how intricate or advanced.
If every museum in the world right now binned off their collections to the original nations, and those nations immediately destroyed those artefacts, we’d lose an unfathomable amount of historical importance and teaching.
