Butina is now a Russian member of parliament. Cohen only spent two weeks in prison. Gates got probation. Kilimnik was never arrested. Manafort was pardoned. Papadopoulos was sentenced to 14 days in prison, and spent twelve days there. Stone was pardoned before he even started his sentence.
All these people retained their power and privilege, and in some cases (Butina) expanded it. That is why there is a general sense that nothing came out of the Mueller investigation.
Can we PLEASE stop pretending that nothing came out of the Mueller report? This is Republican propaganda.
Trump abusing the presidential pardon power does not change the fact that the DOJ obtained guilty pleas/convictions and multi-year sentences for Stone/Manafort/etc. At minimum, the Mueller report is not evidence of the DOJ's unwillingness to act (as is constantly being implied).
34 indictments and 9 successful prosecutions against senior Trump officials. Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, and others were issued prison sentences.
No, Trump himself was not indicted, but drawing conclusions about Trump's own individual conduct was also not in the direct scope/authority of Mueller's investigation. This is very different from the current DOJ action, where we already know that Trump himself is the subject of the investigation.
"If you take the exact same conduct -- and make it not about Donald Trump and not about a former president of the United States, would the case have been indicted? It would have been indicted in a flat second," Pomerantz said Sunday. He called Bragg's decision not to bring the case a "grave failure of justice.".
