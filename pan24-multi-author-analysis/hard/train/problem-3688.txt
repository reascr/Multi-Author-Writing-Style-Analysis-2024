Trump would instantly turn on any lawyer that suggested he wasn't smart and mentally competent. His narcissism absolutely will not allow it.
He also doesn't meet the definition of legally insane since he hid his actions and engaged in other deceitful behavior, proving he knew it was wrong.
He is clearly NOT "insane", however, in the legal sense of being unable to diffetentiate "right from wrong." His constant obstruction of justice clearly demonstrates he knew what he was doing was unlawful, foresaw the repercussions, and pre-meditated how to avoid being caught.
His "criminal mindset" and "consciousness of guilt" are so pervasive that despite his glaringly obvious mental deficiencies, it would be impossible for him to demonstrate that he was anything less than fully aware that his actions were illegal.
He IS "insane" in the sense that his sociopathy and narcicism are so far out of balance that he consistantly makes decisions that not only break societal norms, but routinely put him in danger.
Well, unfortunately for all of us who will be cleaning up the remnants of the damage his post-factual scorched earth brand of fascist hate-fueled plutocracy caused for decades.
