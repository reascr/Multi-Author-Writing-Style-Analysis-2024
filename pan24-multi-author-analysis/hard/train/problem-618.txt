What are you talking about? People in Taiwan are literally Chinese people that sailed a boat over to the island throughout history and the 2 million that lost a war in WWII and retreated to taiwan.
KMT isn't pro unification, KMT is literally the party that fought and lost the civil war in China and fled to taiwan to form republic of china aka taiwan.
Sure, an independent Taiwan definitely does not want to be ruled by the PRC, but im afraid that choice would be made in either Washinon or Beijing and not Taipei.
So, your two points are really irrelevant, because the status quo was always an independent Taiwan unwilling to be ruled by the PRC. This election cycle didn't prove otherwise, and DPP is not altering the status quo.
Ironically it's a view among some dpp supporters that those that won't vote dpp shouldn't be allowed to vote less the outcome threatens democracy. There's a strong undertone of if people aren't grateful for them standing up to the Pooh bear they don't deserve living in Taiwan.
