It's not even interesting on abuse reddits, it's just a repeating cliche... a known pattern like gaslighting, FLEAs, projection, reversal, and triangulation.
Triangulation, in the context of abuse, means the abuser using a third party to manipulate the victim. For instance, say a person cut contact with an abuser to try and protect themselves.. the abuser might convince a third person to 'go talk to' the victim, either to find out information or convince the victim to return to the abuser.
That one is the coping strategies or similarities to a victim's abuser that the victim picked up during the abuse. Metaphorically it's like picking up fleas from the abuser, maladaptive patterns that are generally unhealthy and cause lonerm harm to the victim. They can, though don't necessarily, lead to generational abuse as the victim can copy the abusers behavior or leave the trauma of the abuse unhealed, which can cause the victim to then abuse others.
Tell that to any abuse victim who cried and demanded to be removed from abusive households from young childhood, who were dismissed and ignored, sometimes with dumbass excuses like yours.
Parents go No-Contact with abusive family members, abusive family members outrage at the loss of control/scapegoat. So they first rage, then try to hoover back with lovebombs, then when all that fails, they try to sue for their 'right to see their grandchildren'.
