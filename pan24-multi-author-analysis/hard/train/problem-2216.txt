I bought a new car last year in the UK, I had every intention of going electric, until I realised they're all approx Â£10k dearer. Even in an instance of the same model.
I guess as production and demand increase, prices will come down, but price is definitely pricing people out of the switch at the moment.
The only thing that ever drives down prices is when there's more supply than demand. So as competition heats up and more manufacturers begin putting out (non-trivial) amounts of EVs, yes, prices will come down.
I'm sure that's true. But I'm also sure that whatever car you almost bought? They just sold it to someone else.
As more get sold, they will eventually come down in price. Think back to the introduction of the DVD player. For the first little while, they were out of reach for the average family, as they were sitting at roughly $1000, depending on location. But, as time went on, they eventually sold for $50 each. As the market share of EVs grows, the costs will start to level out. Advancements in manufacturing also help reduce the overall costs.
