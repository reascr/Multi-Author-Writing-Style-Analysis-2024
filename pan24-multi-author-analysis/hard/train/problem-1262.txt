I mean, it’s one thing to force this “extreme culture” at a company like SpaceX, where there’s VERY few other opportunities for similar work…. But the same shit you can get away with at SpaceX is NOT going to fly at Twitter of all places. I’m not sure how this was lost on Musk, but apparently it was.
Fuck around and find out @ Elon Musk. Have fun running the company with few yes man around you, who will definitely not use you for their own good. Imagine spending 44b(eventually even more) on company, just so you can kill it and lose it all. This year really showed us how dumb some people are. Putler attacking Ukraine, thinking the West would not react. Now his whole nation is collapsing, West is united once again and his people are dying more and more each week in the war while Ukraine is getting stronger and stronger. Elon, thinking he will gain respect for buying twitter but in fact, more people realized how scummy he is. Now he is getting memed every single second on Twitter, platform he bought for 44b. Who is next?
