They did. Russia is pushing new recruits into uniforms to fill the spots. They lost a lot of tanks though and a lot of experienced (by comparison to the new meat anyway) are dead or out of action.
Not quite, while they have take pretty massive losses (I think I saw something stating like, 50% of their tanks), they have not been outright destroyed yet.
On the other hand, the 4th Guards Tank Division (which is a part of this 1st Guards Tank Army) was more or less completely destroyed when Ukraine encircled Izium.
When the Karkhiv counteroffensive happened, the Ukrainian army attempted to encircle 4th GTD at Izium. The 4th GTD then retreated back into Russia, however they lost what would have been 50% of their tanks when they were at full strenh, considering their losses prior to being sent to Kharkiv, this loss here meant that the 4th GTD no longer existed as an effective fighting force.
Now these guys (1st GTA) have taken pretty massive losses, and I remember seeing something say they lost 50% of their tanks since the invasion began, but thatâ€™s nothing compared to the 4th GTD.
