This would have been pretty shortly after 9/11. The American public would have held flag waving parades for Bush no matter who he bombed as long as he was bombing SOMEONE.
With India taking equipment from Russia the US wants to prop up Pakistan to maintain parity, this is something the US has been doing with Pakistan for decades, which is why they had their fleet of F16s in the first place. Neither of those countries give a shit about what the US and Russia are doing anywhere else, but the US (and most of the world) wants them to remain at a stalemate to the extent possible because and India/Pakistan/China conflict is bad news for everyone.
It doesn't really show that at all, those countries are more so neutral or supporting Russia to spite the West for its colonization and imperialism of their countries in the past, American influence is just as strong as its ever been especially now that the world sees how weak Russia really is, when you say multi-polar do you mean China? Because it's doubtful they can challenge the US hegemony in any significant way with all the internal problems they face now.
With the exception of maybe China (maybe) the only real question in whether the US will militarily do something is whether they are ok with the consequences of that action. Musharif thought maybe they wouldn't be and W called his bluff. And maybe he was bluffing too but we'll never know.
As heated as the American public was at the time I think W was likely not bluffing. We were going in and anyone in our way was going to catch jdams all day til they weren't any longer.
