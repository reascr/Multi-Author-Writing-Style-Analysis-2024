My parents were Holocaust survivors. I have an image in my head of my grandparents sitting at their kitchen table in Paris in the 1930’s discussing the events in Germany, and the growing issues in France. “Are we overreacting? It’s not that bad. It can’t get much worse, can it?”.
Criticizing Israel is not antisemitism. Targeting Jews in general, because of Israel, absolutely is.
If the person in question is actually a Zionist they’re not getting attacked because they’re Jewish. They’re just conflating the two things and crying antisemitism. These articles both conflate the two. They say the person being harassed is “someone who supports Israel”. This means they are not just being harassed because they are Jewish.
There is a lot of far right antisemitism related to Israel. There is also a lot of far left antisemitism related to Israel. But you are right, there is more data here than they are revealing. They identified 1000/4000 respondents as either right wing or left wing without breaking down how each group responded.
4000 people were surveyed and there seems to only be political data on 1000. They should be able to tell you how these respondents responded though.
Yes but the antisemitism "about Israel" in the survey is for the most part not actually about Israel. For example saying American Jews are more loyal to Israel than America is antisemitism. Saying that Israel is not criticized in the media because of the Jews that control the media is antisemitic. Saying Israel treats Palestinians the same way the Nazis treated the Jews is antisemitism.
So often not supporting Israel is wrapped into antisemitism. There are plenty of countries that I don’t support and would feel inclined to spend time with people who support those nations.
