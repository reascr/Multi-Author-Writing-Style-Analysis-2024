Meanwhile, I come from the Democratic Party of the 1970s. Hippies and free love... or, at least, cheap love and such. Kinda. Nice to see the Dems get some life back in them!
I hear you. It's sad to remember that the Republican Party gave birth to Lincoln and Eisenhower and ... well, I'm sure there was a third good Republican. My point is there weren't always this way but a lot of people know them as only this way. I feel sorry for those old Republicans who once could identify with their party.
He is the republican party, nothing but trash. All the people I knew who voted Trump, were liars. Always exaggerating their lives as they never really did anything, so have to make up things. One person I knew took my marine stories told around a fire and made them his own, lie right to your face about pretty much anything. Had not seen some people in quite some time, 10 yrs later absolutely nothing has changed for them, still spinning their wheels as they complain they are being left behind. In their 50s, zero savings, same junk piled in the yard, spend all day smoking pot. Then rant the country can't be left in the hands of democrats.
