Women are not pregnant are being refused medications for illnesses that could cause harm to a fetus simply because they are child bearing age (which spans decades).
And compliance doesn’t protect you from being refused medical care when you have a miscarriage and need a DNC. Or there is a complication in the pregnancy that is potentially life threatening but doctors refuse to do a termination until the woman is at death’s door because the fetus still has a heartbeat.
All of these Republican fckers implementating bans and restrictions should be sued into oblivion for every health care issue related to the bans.
There hasn’t been nearly enough attention on how this is affecting women’s health who didn’t even want an abortion. Not only do they want to prevent women from having abortions, they’re happy to risk the lives of those who don’t.
When abortion care is criminalized women suffer, and die needlessly. It’s not about what arbitrary week somebody wants to choose, it’s about being able to make decisions when there’s an emergency.
