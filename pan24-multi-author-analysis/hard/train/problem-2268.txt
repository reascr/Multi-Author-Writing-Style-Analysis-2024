Maybe you just stop and wonder a little about all the countries the US has couped just for silly reasons, just because the US could really. And all the money the US has made out of ruining those countries, whose people now live in poverty, and ohhh all those Americans who don't even know the horrible things their previous presidents have done, because this part of history isn't taught obviously. But yes maybe that, would actually be a nice thought. Regular Americans live a great life compared to the rest of the world, ya'll could keep getting richer and close your eyes, but don't think that makes ya'll innocents.
If you think "regular" Americans are getting richer, you're sadly mistaken. As far as how what the Government does....yeah I fought in Iraq. I got to see firsthand how this country destroyed a sovereign nation so the Rich could Rob those people of their resources. Trust not all us Americans are proud....even further, there are parts of American history that Republicans want to delete...basically the 50'-70's because of the civil injustice that was here. I still gotta worry about being shot just for my color by the very same people who are there to "protect and serve" (police).
Not all Americans are ignorant to the world. There is just nothing we can do. Literally the average American doesn't make enough to get into a political office to change anything. We are all new-age slaves. Owned by a credit score and Corporate America who basically buys congress through lobbying (paying congress to get their way)....
Sending money abroad while raising taxes, food cost, and shorting the average American people. While I'm all for humanitarian efforts, I believe they should begin at home and not be a back breaker for "us regular Americans".
