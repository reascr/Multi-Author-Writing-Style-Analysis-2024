Heh. I still remember listening, mouth wide open in shock, to a relative who is a nurse who tried to tell me that her hospital had a post-birth abortion room where they’d drop off the babies and wait for them to starve to death.
Naturally, I asked—with obvious skepticism—if she had ever seen this murder room. “No, it’s a secret.” Now, she was a high-ranking administrator/nurse there, so I asked her if she at least knew where it was given her rank. “No, it’s a secret.” Had she ever seen them carrying babies around the halls who mysteriously disappear? Of course not.
idk. They've been talking about how democrats cheat in elections for as long as I've been alive. Usually it's pointing to one off cases of dead people voting or people voting twice that are quickly proven false under scrutiny (i.e. two people happen to have the same name) and claiming that it represents a broader pattern. The main difference lately has been that instead of just claiming they were cheated, they try to do an insurrection and just install their guy.
