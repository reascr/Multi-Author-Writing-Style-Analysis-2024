My mother had stage 3 cancer and underwent chemo and radiation during 2020. It sucks, but she was able to stay indoors for a year and a half and didn't end up catching COVID until after she was like triple vaccinated (which happened later than the general populace due to her weakened immune system).
My friend works in liquor PR in New York, and lots of liquor companies hold branded parties to get their names out there. In February of 2020 I was my friend's +1 to a party being thrown by some Italian liqueur brand, only to show up and be told that the Italian staff weren't being allowed out of Italy due to COVID ripping through that country. I thought nothing of it, but like a week later it hit NY and I'm pretty sure I started locking down then.
With a bit of common sense and, unfortunately, a major lifestyle change, cancer patients and the immunocompromised can adapt.
Friendly reminder cancer patients and other immunocompromised people are still at huge risk and dying. Not that I disagree with anything inherently but it feels like this is often not included in discussion.
