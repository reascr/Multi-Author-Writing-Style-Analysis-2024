I have been wondering if a price cap would even work. Surely Russia could simply choose to sell to those non-aligned nations at something approaching the a dual costs associated with drilling/transport.
Perhaps this could provide an impetus for insurers to set up shop in non-aligned countries. Think an insurer based in Mumbai and underwrites the policies in rupees. Of course, such an entity would be a pretty boutique operation; it could not deal in western/Allieâ€™s ports.
But, as you say, one set of customers are unlikely to pay substantially more than what others will pay. And Russia has to sell oil/gas because it is the prime earner for them (though there remains tremendous nickel, iron, and all manner of other critical resources that the world is importing). The end result may very well be that the world is able to push the market price of oil well below what the Russian state budget requires, perhaps even below the cost of production.
Oil/LNG tankers require insurance. Most insurers are western and will have to abide by the rules. Additionally, if anyone wants to deal in dollars they have to contend with the sanctions.
They're not joining the sanctions. China is only doing this because they're worried Russia won't honor the insurance contracts. They're only looking out for China.
