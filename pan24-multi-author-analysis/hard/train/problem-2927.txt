It's a good tactics of you know that your officers are shite, allows for success with army they have, it also allows for lower casualties on strategic level despite that individual attacks can suffer horrendous ones.
If we go back to Bakhamut example, if Ukraine inflicts disproportional casualties in this battle, it is worth holding, but also denying political win for Russia might increase infighting and affect coordination between competing Russian armies.
On the otherside, its advantageous to expose russia's losses whenever and wherever possible, to weaken russia and again, assist Ukraine.
And, if you think NATOs purpose is to destroy Russia, rather than to defend against Russian aggression, why don't they strike Russia now, while the Russian military is busy shitting the bed in Ukraine?
Why wouldn't the countries supporting Ukraine, not sending top technical arms per person, night vision, computer sat, location and the marksmen take out the Russian enfentry like ducks o and a pond. 1500, 2000, 2500 meter sniper shots, all kills no wasted rounds. Supported with barrage fire form cannons tanks etc..
