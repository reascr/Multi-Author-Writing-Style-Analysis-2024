If you look at /r/conservative, they are still clinging onto it somehow. Though it's shifting toward "why is Paul holding a cocktail and smiling", as if seeing the police when a murderous intruder has broken into your house wouldn't make you happy, and there's no way a smooth talking political spouse couldn't talk such an intruder into letting him pour a drink (which may or may not be a cocktail).
In the particular case of not asking for help, I would expect the police to take the lead upon arrival. No need to make the situation worse through startling action. The hammer speaks for itself.
It's strange because of the political currents which caused this particular confluence of events. Years of the far right calling for Nancy's death led to this actual attempt. The far right accepts no responsibility and claims the victim brought it on himself for reasons that make no sense but feed their internal narrative. The context is the strange thing.
That’s weird. Why were they just like chillin when the door opened. Pelosi wasn’t like freaking out or asking for help. Fucking bizarre. They were both just standing there chillin’.
Some people also have chill for days. If I believe I had enough control I would for sure greet the police. They don't know what is going on an are more likely to assume the aggressive party is the attacker.
