Second sentence quoted: It lacks clarity in that the total sum is for "promised or sent aid." It falls apart at: "sent in that span.".
It says: "What countries have pledged to Ukraine...Total military, financial and humanitarian aid promised by governments to Ukraine, Jan. 24, 2022 through Nov. 20, excluding loans.".
Ah yes. The 50 billion wasn’t enough to make people mad so now its 200 billion. Source: who cares. Cherry on top: ‘we must suspend all foreign aid for the war and everyone can hug it out’.
They even say this exact link is their own source but didn’t link it themselves, probably because it shows they’re lying.
edit: actually their source is ‘we straight up lied and didn’t link the thing we’re quoting because it shows we’re lying’.
Do you even need to ask? Its russia. They think Ukraine might withdraw from Bakhmut after 5 months of stalling them there so theres a coordinated bullshit parade trying to make it out like aid and fighting is pointless. 50 billion wasn’t enough so now its 200 billion. Whatever the narrative requires, expect nothing from Fox and you’ll still be disappointed.
