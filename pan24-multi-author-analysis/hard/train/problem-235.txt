Yes and no - after introducing price cap Russia is selling its oil to India below costs of mining. That means that only India is profiting on this transactions and Russia is at 0 income.
West calculated that it is best option. Elimination 100% of Russian oil from market will enormously increase its prices and probably EU couldnt handle it. In this case Russians are slaves working for free and lowering global oil proces. Who knows maybe it is the best solution: anglo-saxons were always best at statistics in warfare.
Russia sells its oil for $45 because only India and China are buying. This oil have to be shipped from Baltic ports so its transport costs to India are much higher than oil from Persian Gulf.
More like US is buying oil from India so India can buy oil from Russia that costs more then it produces so it costs Russia more money to sell oil to India.
US buying the same oil India bought from Russia, which is being "funded" for the war? \gasp\ Reddit diplomats, we have to punish US for this Boycott USA /s.
