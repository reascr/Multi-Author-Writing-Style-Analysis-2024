I think you’re thinking of the epic of Gilgamesh which is the oldest book, the oldest story written down is a religious story of Inanna written by Enheduanna. Beowulf is the oldest story written in English.
Idk it’s barely the same language if it is, and I don’t think the whole of it is valuable. It’s not that I think it’s inappropriate it’s that it’s really difficult to read. Like I have a bachelors degree and speak English, Latin, and German, which should lead me to like a basicish ability to triangulate meaning, but I’d need a translation guide especially since the evolution of English since it was written was fairly chaotic.
I hated English class in school for so long, it was reading boring books I didn’t want to read but it taught me how to think and analyze media and I’m so grateful I had to read those books. And yeah sometimes it made me uncomfortable. That was occasionally the point.
Slight tangent. The Inbetweeners (UK) is one of my absolute favorite shows but The Inbetweeners (US) was absolutely horrible. Among the many reasons the US version was bad, and to me the top reason, is that there's essentially no dirty language. High schoolers have very filthy mouths and minds so any show that's set in highschool without foul language is really a big stretch on reality.
The idea that high schoolers are incapable of understanding "adult" dialogue is an absolute farce. They see much worse shit on the internet on a daily basis. And you can go into the "young adult" section of any library and find a whole host of books full of sex and violence. Hell, Ender's Game, a near-universally beloved science fiction novel aimed at "young adults", has underage nudity and graphic violence - one scene even has both. And somehow people have been able to handle it just fine.
