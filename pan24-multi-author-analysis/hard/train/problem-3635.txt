Very deliberate, just like how CIA invested millions of dollars in Wahabhist indoctrination, Evangelical missionaries were funded by CIA and the state department, at some point the interests aligned but then as the US veered more and more left, evangelicals took a more anti American stance. The last hurrah was in Russia, when CIA sent in an army of right wing activists and missionaries to resurrect religiosity in post Soviet Russia, it backfired spectacularly as Russians and specially the FSB (and Putin) realized those who came to indoctrinate them really didnâ€™t like Washinon D.C at all, hence FSB and Putin cultivated them and today we have a very significant number of Americans who believe Putin, Russia and authoritarianism is the solution to all the societal problems they encounter.
Not just Wahabhism but born again evangelism was spread first in Latin America to fight liberation theology amongst Catholics but both Wahabhism and born again evangelism have turned nihilist and want to see America dead, blow back is a bitch.
I knew about the liberation theology priests persecuted in South America, but I never associated that with evangelianism's rise to counter left-christianity. Makes sense, but I'm not sure how deliberate that could have been.
I thought this was public knowledge, propping up dictators and conservativism to stop popular movements that could turn communist was in fashion during the cold war. The issue is that once the cold war is over, they are still there and are hard to control and get rid of (e.g. Saddam, the Shah in Iran, Brazil's military dictatorship).
