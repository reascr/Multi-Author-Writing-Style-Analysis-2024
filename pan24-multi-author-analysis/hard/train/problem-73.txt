You could tell me that you knew with 99% certainty that Biden would drop dead after inauguration, and I would still vote for him over any Republican candidate and the vast majority of Democratic ones.
If you think Joe Biden - without union support - is going to outperform Any Generic Democrat, then we're just going to have to disagree until one of us is proven right.
Neolibs before the 2020 election: "The left has to swallow their pride and rally behind Biden just this once to beat Trump.
I think Biden beats Trump again, full confidence on that. Trump is never being president again. I fully believe that...
I would too...but I don't know if the rest of the country will see it that way. I just have lost faith in this country as a whole, especially GOP voters. They have given us two downright terrible presidents their last two chances and are looking to give us a third.
The problem with these people is they ignore the very real threat they put into office. Like, for example the last orange clown that would have gladly been a dictator if he could have and the very real threat that this next guy, Desantis, probably wants to make this a theocracy based on everything he does and says at least.
I just don't have confidence that Biden can beat Desantis. I hope he does, that would be great for a GOP rising star to be ousted by great grandpa, but I worry the surface level narrative of "He's too old..." will hurt Biden unless he's going up against another old person, like Trump.
