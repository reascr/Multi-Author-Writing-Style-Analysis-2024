So it says that the religious exemption is only for non-profits. While the legal protections in terms of the government and what marriage grants you is good... But are we sure we want to force people to participate in things that they disagree with religiously, or even if it is something that they don't like? Since there isn't a problem in finding people to make your wedding website, bake your wedding cake, or anything else like that I can't understand why the government can force you to participate in something you don't want to be part of. What happens when it is something you disagree with down the line? My inner libertarian comes out for stuff like this and I can't help but be against anything that forces someone to participate in an activity they don't want to. Like, just hire someone else.
Dude. I don't care if people get married to the same sex. It doesn't affect me. You're the one who wants to FORCE people to participate in the act. Right now there is a supreme court case about a web designer who doesn't want to type up a website about a husband marrying a husband because he doesn't want to participate in something he disagrees with. Just leave him alone. If he says he doesn't want to participate in something he doesn't like then don't use the government to force him. That is authoritarian. Leave people alone.
How about you guys just leave people alone? Like, don't interfere with who marries who or what. If some pastors(who don't receive money from the government) don't want to marry a couple, then fine. If they want to, then also fine.
