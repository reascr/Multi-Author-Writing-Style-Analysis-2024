Listen to the first season of the podcast It Could Happen here. I think that that paints an accurate picture of what a second American civil war would look like.
The parallelisms between the last few years and the lead up to the civil war are disturbing. By my count we've now passed some version of "the Caning of Charles Sumner" and after the court rules on Moore v. Harper and establishes Independent state legislature theory as the law of the land, we'll introduce our version of Popular Sovereignty and with it our version of Bleeding Kansas is not far off.
4) lawsuits will be filed, but with Moore v. Harper pending at the Supreme Court, and the Court looking like they’re about to rule that state legislatures are allowed to certify whatever election results they want, regardless of how the people vote, all of the above will be completely above board.
3) in close races that are won by Democrats in states with GOP-controlled legislatures, the legislatures will award elections to the GOP anyway.
Well, a bunch of election denier Republicans are running in these midterms, lots of whom are competitive, and not just in red states either. So it’s safe to say that the GOP learned the lesson that they can openly run candidates that don’t believe in democracy (unless they win, of course), and people just… won’t really push back against that in any meaningful way. So that’ll just be the GOP’s MO from now on.
