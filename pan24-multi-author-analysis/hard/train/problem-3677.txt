Of course it’s not the first time. But with current states and the enormous crisis that the zerocovid policy brings, it’s a much much bigger problem than earlier.
This last part is just guess work but I could imagine that not only would that throw Xi under the bus but it might be enough to cause an outright revolution in China because the entire communist party is involved in this.
But it’s so much more. Chinese propaganda for a long time has been saying that the west (especially the US) has been in decline and is rotten. Which is why the CCP has to shield their population to save them from suffering the same fate. Now imagine how hollow that story will be if you end up bowing down to the supremacy of the west by acknowledging that their vaccines are better than your own.
Accepting a Western vaccine now essentially says "we should have done this a couple years ago and didn't". There's pride involved but also a sane understanding there may be collapse if zero covid fails. While it's fine to admit mistakes, this mistake would have needlessly harmed so many.
