The war started because Putin thought he could win quick and easy. Not helping Ukraine is literally helping that old fuck get it his way.
If the West didn't arm Ukraine, the war was over year ago on viable conditions. Arming Ukraine won't change the outcome of the war, it is only multiplying deaths. So Corbyn is a smart guy, at least much smarter than an average MSM-bullshit eating redditor.
Tbf Corbyn was a bit shit and some of his opinions are dodgy but this insistence on him being unelectable doesn’t really take into account the whole picture. It’s like saying democratically elected socialist governments are predispositioned to having coup attempts without mentioning the CIA.
I really hope starmer comes in and makes the massive changes this country badly needs but let’s be honest it’s going to be a rebrand of northern powerhouse whilst sucking up to the city of London and maybe a few surestarts. Given their incoherent position on the nhs I wonder if they will even get waiting times down; which new labour can claim as one of their greatest victories.
He was a toxic mess after 2018, after being attacked relentlessly for years by the press, enabled by the right wing of his own party who, let’s remember, actively wanted the Labour Party to lose in 2017.
It would be a massive problem for Labour because the would be picked apart by the press as basically still being run by Corbyn in all but name and the swing voters they need to win over (that Corbyn couldn't) would be probably be deterred.
I imagine (going on his political career), Corbyn refused to play ball and was happy to cause problems to the Labour party going forwards.
