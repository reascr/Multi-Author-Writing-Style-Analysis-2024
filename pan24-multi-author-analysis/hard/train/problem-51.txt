This is exactly why all these candidates lost, and the GOP audibly knows it. Now these people are doubling down on the shit that made them lose in the first place?
The whole “how can biden win, he doesn’t even have huge rally’s and flags etc” sentiment is so telling. These people can’t even fathom, how someone can win without a cult following, without merch and without fanboy rallies and religious tier conventions surrounding these candidates.
They simply can’t imagine people voting on policy, and decorum, over “who gets the most attention, they deserve to win!”.
It fucking sucks that it's come to this, but there's no sense in denying that the vast majority of voters don't see it as anything but popularity.
This both sides are equally undermining the election process and "none of them are for the people" (all politicians are equally bad) is the weakest of all talking points. Want to quantify your claim? How many times and ways has Donald Trump claimed the 2020 election was stolen? What's the number? And you want to put a number out their for how many times you claim Hillary claimed the 2016 election was stolen? Are those numbers equal, close?
