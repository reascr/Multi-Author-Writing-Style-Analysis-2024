People on Twitter are still saying they don't care. It's clear that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. This is unfortunately where we are today. If the information doesn't match your current beliefs, then it must be incorrect.
Edit: if there's any misunderstanding here, I'm saying people, not myself, are saying on twitter there were clear election fraud. This isn't something I believe as there are no evidence to support that claim.
Aww so there’s all the evidence you need cons that he doesn’t believe the things he says, and is really just manipulating you to be constantly outraged by fake things.
The truth is election fraud isn’t the only thing they can muster, but it’s what trump started saying before they could get their bearings and they all latched on. So now because one orange d-bag couldn’t take a loss like a third of the country think our election was fraudulent. Despite them believing our very freedom has been stolen from us by a shadow government they’ve done jack and shit to take the country back after the 6th cause deep down they know it’s a lie and they know they’re full of shit.
