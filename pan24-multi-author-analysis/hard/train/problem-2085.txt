I never said that, in any shape or form, I just simply said having a massive army doesn’t always correlate to it being powerful.
Stats are stats, and rankings are rankings. It’s easy to gauge the size of the army, but then you also have to factor in a shit load of other stats into the equation to gauge power.
What happened in Desert Storm perfectly supports this. Those ‘poor Iraqis,’ who got the retaliation they deserved, learnt having a large army doesn’t do much without support. As are the Russians now.
There ARE no russian innocents in this war. They want this war, they like to kill and they want to destroy the entire culture of a european country only because it resisted the invasion.
The ones that oppose the war are so small in number that they appear as statistical margin of error.
The russians WHOLEHEARTEDLY support this war. Around 80% according to the recent polls. All the raping, looting and kidnapping is also widely approved. There are no innocents.
That statement is completely ignorant of the actual real situation. Yeah, there are people that are against it, even if they do not speak about it, but have you been to their telegram channels? Have you been to the social platforms? Regular citizens, their wives call out for rapes, beheadings, castration of Ukrainian soldiers and civilian population. Cheer at dead Ukrainians. Celebrate another Ukrainian civilian target being destroyed. It's fucking VILE in there.
Yeah, that's the other thing. They have manpower on paper but I'd bet one normal American soldier is probably worth 3 or 4 North Korean soldiers, maybe more. It's just logistics and training.
