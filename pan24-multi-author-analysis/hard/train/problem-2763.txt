There are still people in the GOP who think that Trump can be controlled, and They are delusional. Donald Trump will always do what he wants, with little regard for anyone else, And he will do everything in his power to burn anyone who gets in his way.
If you give a terribly toxic individual like Trump that much power, you'd better believe he'll burn everything down and take out anyone he can on his way out. He wanted to be a dictator. Republicans let him when it came to the Republican Party.
Politically, the GOP had no choice. They would’ve had to tell their voters, “no, y’all are fucking idiots.” It would never happen. No political party would do that, period. I frankly don’t think the dems would do it were the roles reverse. Pragmatically, they didn’t really have much of a choice if they didn’t want to blow up their own party.
Regardless, my point was more so that they didn’t follow him for the “allure of power and money” like you suggested. They followed him because their voters chose him and put them in a position where their only alternative to following him was blowing up the party.
