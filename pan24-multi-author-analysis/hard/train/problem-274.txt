That's basically saying that you should only find out if a president is a tax cheat AFTER it's too late to do anything about it.
I don't understand how you could think that presidents should have to release their tax records but candidates should not.
Only if you try to make it “disqualifying.” You could pass a law requiring the IRS to furnish the tax returns filed by the President to the public.
2) There is a significant difference between furnishing tax returns to Congress, vs making them public.
5) There would be serious federalism concerns here too, because states are largely empowered to conduct their own elections.
How can you tell states that they can't allow someone on the ballot, or that their electors can't cast a vote for their candidate, or that their votes won't count, without implicating federalism concerns?
The corrupt US congress is unlikely to make this happen - so each state should require candidates to release their returns before any name is allowed on the ballot, at least for national positions.
