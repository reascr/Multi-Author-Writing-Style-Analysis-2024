- Canada is absolutely massive. It's slightly larger than the US, and has the longest coastline in the world.
That being said, Canada's got a pretty big non-military presence in the Arctic. The Canadian Coast Guard has bases and several icebreakers operating up there most of the year.
I think the Canadian military settled on the simpler, saner solution: whenever someone ends up in Canadian territory, scramble jets to deal with it.
All of this combined shows why Canada doesn't really invest much up there. To build up the Arctic would require tens-to-hundreds of billions of dollars (you'd need train routes through completely untouched lands, you'd need to build proper harbours, etc), somehow borne on the taxes of only 38 million Canadians.
They're the world's factory, and finding ways to streamline the northwest passage and undermine Canadian Arctic sovereignty would be huge for them given climate change expectations over the coming decades.
Annual reminder than the US questions Canada's Arctic sovereignty as far as the NW Passage is concerned and that this is a really dumb stance to take in terms of global affairs when both China and Russia would love to drive boats straight through there.
