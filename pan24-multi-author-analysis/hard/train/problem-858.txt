Putin views the west as cowardly and craven, judging by how they’ve been falling over themselves to appease russia for the last thirty years. He thinks that by being more aggressive, he can scare Europe into submission, and that they’ll do absolutely anything to avoid nuclear confrontation.
He would be making a bet that NATO’s response would’ve limited out of fear that he’s crazy enough to launch nukes at NATO countries.
Yeah Russia’s economy would be fucked for a generation but he might hold onto power until his death.
I think he may be preparing his military and population to nuke Ukraine either after the next real attack on Russian soil or a false flag attack.
Ukraine is basically attacking the bases Russia uses to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine. We can hardly ask them to be the whipping boys for the rest of the world.
Will 'nuclear winter' still be a thing since the advent of positive feedback global warning? Indeed it may be the only thing that will get humanity to lower its CO2 emissions (once the initial fires die out).
Remember, we were depending on Russian rockets to get Our guys to the ISS, for years. It finally took a private company, Musk's SpaceX, for the US to be able to stop asking Russia for assistance.
