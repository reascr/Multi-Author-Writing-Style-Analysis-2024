I honestly believe that Europe is on its way to become completely energy independent sooner rather than later, having been pushed towards it by Russia. Hopefully we'll see more funding go to fusion research and incentives as well. An energy independent Europe may be a critical blow to fossil fuel companies around the world.
Still, i maintain hope. Fission is good, but safety and the waste product is not something we want to have to deal with in the long term. Geothermic and hydro power are not available everywhere, wind and solar are not very reliable. Fusion is currently the only clean energy which is not dependent on location or weather. Maybe if we figure out how to create better batteries, solar and wind would become a more viable long term full replacement option, but those have their own issues.
Thirdly, Wind Turbines or Solar Panels can only give you electricity and you can't make anything out of electricity itself. You can only power a device that will create something. Device made using fossil fuels and/or possibly using a fossil fuel of some sort to create something else.
Fossil fuels usually refers to things meant to be burned for heat or energy. That's the primary target that renewables are replacing.
- The kind of renewable energy considered here cannot be easily aligned with the demand, because of its transient nature.
- To re-align renewable energy production with grid demand, or to increase the share of renewable in the energy mix, the renewable energy needs to be stored which isn't a solved problem at scale.
