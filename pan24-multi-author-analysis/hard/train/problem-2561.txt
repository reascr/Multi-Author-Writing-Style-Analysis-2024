Like with most cases, it depends on circumstances and if the parole officer doesn't like you. They're probably not going to like you either way not that it matters and not that you would like them; but they tolerate people who are broken down in life and/or fearful of them more. If someone on parole is a full blown meth user who doesn't care about going to jail literally every other week, the parole officer will sometimes give them a pass on weed as long as they stay off of meth. If you come off privileged at all to them (this can sometimes be as simple as just having a lawyer), they will take it on themselves to 'show you the bottom' by abusing their power with frequent, arbitrary and made up sanctions because they think they're teaching you a lesson. Its the exact same mentality as a sadist/school bully. It also doesn't help if you're black or look Jewish.
But parole officers are regularly and repeatedly jailing people for 1 day to 6 months or more for having THC in a urine test, including in Oregon. The punishment and damage is as bad as convictions and sentencing but no charges are involved since parole officers can just jail parolees for looking at them the wrong way or on mere suspicion.
So, people sentenced to state prison who are being released with conditions that would otherwise be onerous, unfair, or illegal to impose on someone who wasn't still serving a sentence.
Also, anyone who can be bothered to malinger their way into a medical marijuana recommendation can use it in Oregon even when on probation or parole.
Oregon law specifically notes that one can be required to test for drugs and alcohol, including cannabis under specific circumstances (history of substance problems), but it's not an inherent condition of probation.
