"The use of such a missile against a densely populated city is in fact terrorism against the civilian population. It is a Kh-22 missile, an old Soviet missile, developed in the Soviet Union, which brought so much grief to the residents of Dnipro yesterday. We remember Kremenchuk [a June 2022 missile attack on the Amstor shopping center in Kremenchuk, in which 20 people were killed], what happened there. This is not a shame, there should be an appropriate legal assessment - what happened in Kremenchuk, and in Dnipro, and in other cities where this missile was used, should be condemned by the world community in the harshest way," Ihnat said.
Ihnat added that to destroy such missiles, Ukraine needs modern air defense systems capable of hitting ballistic targets, including Iskanders, potential Iranian-made missiles, if Russia receives them, and also one of the most powerful and inaccurate missiles, such as a Kh-22 missile.
He recalled that the enemy had already used more than 210 such missiles in Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion.
In the context of this conflict though, it seems pretty explicit that the Russians are going after civilian targets. They're open about going after civilian power and water infrastructure and we have intercepted communications of troops stating they were ordered to aim at civilian buildings. Looking at how entire cities are being leveled it'd take some mental gymnastics to believe there were sticking to military targets.
