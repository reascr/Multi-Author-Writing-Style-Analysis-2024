Trump could run as an Independent in only a few states, denying anyone from getting 270 electoral votes, sending the election to the House, where, I don’t know who they would choose. DeSantis?
Exactly. He could win enough electoral votes to prevent DeSantis from reaching 270. Let’s say Biden was close but also under 270. The.man the election would be thrown to the House, where knowing the idiots in charge, would pick Trump.
Yet other polls show Trump walloping any other Republican. Polls are not even a little bit reliable in the age of cell phones. The people that respond to them are more often than not White Retirees that still have a land line that they answer, or White Retirees that answer Fox News polls because they were instructed to by the host.
DeSantis has no Charisma. He stays on the National Stage through ever escalating Illegal/Unconstitutional stunts of intolerable cruelty. Eventually he is going to cross a line that even Far Right Sympathizer Garland cannot ignore, and his only means of staying relevant will evaporate.
