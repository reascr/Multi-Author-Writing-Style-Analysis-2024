Mortgage companies are dead right now, most of the operations in that industry are laid off. That is an industry that is directly affected by rate changes. Many have gone out of business. There are other industries going through the same thing and no pandemic extra unemployment income at this time. (Same industry was super busy during the pandemic when many others were unemployed, at that time the stock market issues resulted in low rates).
What if there's no such thing as a "recession" when you have a systemic labor shortage and thus no one who actually WORKS for a living is going to lose their job, even if the precious stock market slumps?
The older I get the more it seems to me like this is all a giant load of bullshit, that our economy has so much wealth and mass that any "recession" is just a manifestation of the way the wealthy push workers to the ground to maintain an advantage. And this time around they just can't do it because there isn't enough labor pool for the scam to function.
