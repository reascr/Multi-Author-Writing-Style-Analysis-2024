With what’s going on around Taiwan, this doesn’t surprise me. I have a nephew who recently became a Marine corp officer. We were planning on going to his graduation from some officer training thing he’s doing. We were told that there will be no graduation ceremony because they are being deployed immediately as there is concern over a possible war with China over Taiwan.
China wants Taiwan and the US will not allow that under any circumstances. I had really hoped that the war in Ukraine would make the Chinese government realize that there was little point in continuing their interest in Taiwan but it seems to have had no effect.
China does not like having democracy on its doorstep. It’s the same reason why they support North Korea. It’s ironic because they know western-style democracy is ultimately where China will end up but they are trying to hold that off as long as possible.
Well tense but stable would describe it before the stupid rotting orange got into office and destroyed any progress of integrating China into the global status quo. Now it is more of two siblings doing the "Im not touching you" game.
The US has actually done a better job at separating their economy from China surprisingly and the credit does unfortunately need to go somewhat to the Trump Admin for that. The US's largest problem would be rare earth metal production for military supplies, which China dominates.
China is on the other hand very dependant on US agriculture to feed it's population and without it much of China would likely starve and could rebel if a war were to drag on for too long.
