In times of low interest rates the quality of those opportunities doesn't need to be as high. When rates go up, those weaker opportunities can sink companies.
Hydrogen infrastructure for aviation (I agree it isn't the best solution for ground transport) is not much more onerous than a switch to battery electric for aviation, the difference is a long haul flight has a chance of getting off the ground with technology achievable in the short to medium term with hydrogen.
Hydrogen fuel cell powering an electric motor is quite efficient, certainly more so than the current powerplants for aircraft.
I do wonder if advancements in hydrogen use combined with advances in pulsejet engines might lead to something viable.
Wasnâ€™t there some hope of being able to use like a scramjet type engine to pressurize hydrogen in flight some day?
Hydrogen without carbon is not able to be held safely or densely enough for aircraft that I can conceive of. Love the tech, but the tech is also there to make synthetic hydrocarbons with captured carbon. Humans have been doing it since WW2 I believe.
So can Carbon. We're better off using charcoal from wood which captures the carbon from the air to constrain the Hydrogen in a Hydrocarbon. Then you don't need to change anything about the engines or storage. The issue though is doing it cost efficiently. Same issue we'd have with making Ammonia from green Hydrogen except without having to deal with Ammonia, which is some nasty shit that would put tonnes of NOx in the air.
The issue with Ammonia is if it escapes, and it wants to be a gas at atmospheric temperature and pressure... It'll kill you way faster than gases that merely harm us by displacing Oxygen. The Hydrocarbons we use don't really evaporate fast enough to asphyxiate us. Avoid Ammonia at all costs.
