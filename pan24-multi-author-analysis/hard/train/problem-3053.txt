Or not? Like, rockets are huge on the launchpad because you need a large amount of thrust to punch through the atmosphere. Then by the time the payload's in orbit it's tiny. Maybe the first time an alien sends a probe or other vessel this way they aren't thinking it should be wrapped in megatons of armour just in case of missile attack.
It also helps to get people to stop thinking that every weird sensor reading is an alien spaceship, since literally none of them have ever been alien spaceships.
Not really. The Mi-8 is a transport helicopter. Not exactly maneuverable. Using the autocannon is actually probably the better option, since it's more cost effective, and against something that slow, it's actually probably more reliable. A missile could overshoot, but the GAU-8/A is going to put holes through everything in a 40' diameter circle.
The main reason to use UAP instead of UFO is because most UAP are exactly that -- "aerial phenomena". Lights reflecting off a cloud? That's not a flying object, but it is an aerial phenomena. Glowing ball of gas above the local dump? Same thing.
Now here's where it gets weird. Yes, the A-10 carries sidewinders. But the two air-to-air kills were done via BRRRRRT.
