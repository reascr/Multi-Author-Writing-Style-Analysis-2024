The fact that the Russian government thinks this is doing anything other than making them look pathetic, or the fact that there are people that actually buy this bullshit.
Seriously, the only people who think Russia is still an alpha dog are the Congressional Republicans that Russia still sponsors.
This is funny considering that Moldova has always been submissive to Russia and they were almost certainly on the menu anyways had Russia not gotten bogged down in Ukraine. They were going to annex Moldova no matter what they did.
From what I've heard, it's a contentious topic in Moldova. A lot of people believe it would be very sensical. Romanians and Moldovans are essentially the same people, and Romania is much more prosperous than Moldova. It could solve a lot of their economic problems if they joined together. Unfortunately, others view the idea with disdain, as over the near 80 years of Soviet occupation, a small bit of Soviet Moldovan identity was formed, and some people still hold onto that. Instead of seeing the state of their country as being a consequence of communism, they view it as a consequence of the modern corrupt Moldovan government, and they long for a return to the good old days in the Soviet Union.
In reality, Moldova was poor even then. The modern issues of Moldova are a result of both old and current corruption. If people could agree on that, then I think some day there may be a solution. As for right now, nothing will change so long as this debate is bogged down in polarized mindsets and continued governmental neglect.
