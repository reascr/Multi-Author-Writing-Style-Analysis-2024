I just don’t see how any of this actual helps them. Florida is a red enough state that they’re going to blindly follow whatever this wannabe does. But elections are still won and lost on moderate middle class voters with two kids and two dogs and they’re not going to be won over by banning their kids from getting a head start on college.
It's crazy to me how on the other end of the country and political spectrum, we have school districts getting rid of AP classes in the name of equity:
These same suburban Republicans/moderate Democrats are flipping a shit over progressives wanting to remove AP/Honors courses for classroom equity reasons. I highly doubt they’re suddenly gonna be fine with it because of “woke shit”.
Rural republicans yes but suburban republicans/swing voters won’t be too keen on Desantis’ policies that torpedo their kids’ chances at getting in to a competitive college.
However, academic standards and competition won’t fall immediately so the large contingent of country club Republicans who expect their kids to follow in their footsteps and attend UF/FSU/UM are going to be PISSED if Bayleigh or Caydyn are suddenly disadvantaged in admissions.
Sadly, they’ll probably have an easier time of it. It’s not like their football teams can get any worse right now.
