Tough for Ukraine, especially with how quick Zelensky came out to denounce Russia. Good thing a direct NATO confrontation with Russia can be avoided now though.
The question is what is NATO's response in order to make sure these Russian accidents don't keep happening. And nothing has changed in that regard. Russia is targetting the Polish border. Failure to respond will mean Russia sees this as a permit to keep firing there and for more 'accidents' to happen.
- If the missile was accidentaly fired at Poland by Ukraine while defending from Russia, then that is Russia's fault.
- If the missile was deliberately fired at Poland by Ukraine, then and only then it would be Ukraine's fault.
The context of my reply is that it matters for the reaction of Poland if the Russians fired a missile which ended up in Poland or if the Ukrainians accidentally hit an ally. In that context, it is not essentially the same just because Russia attacked Ukraine.
Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is illegal and therefore Russia is responsible for everything that happens from both sides, with only one exception :
Morally, the existence of the conflict is Russias fault, 100%, and as such any victims of the war, accidental or not, can be laid at their feet.
