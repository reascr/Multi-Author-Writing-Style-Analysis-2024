Your effectively saying we shouldn't support Ukraine because we'll end up in an all out nuclear war against Russia.
Are we talking about the same Russia that repeatedly and unequivocally denied an intention to invade Ukraine prior to 2/24/22? The same Russia that promised to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty in exchange for releasing their nuclear weapons? The same Russia that near daily makes nuclear threats against the West and tout how their missiles can evade our missile defense systems? Look, I don’t think they’re going to invade us tomorrow but if left unchecked I don’t think it’s a crazy idea (e.g. giving weapons to crazy neo-Confederates, sending their mercenaries to attack, information warfare like they have since 2016) especially if emboldened and in coordination with another hostile country like China.
Young-ish person here. Your position implicitly assumes that if the US does not go to war, a war will not come to US. There’s a saying about fool me once and fool me twice. If the first world wars meant anything to America they meant that isolationism and appeasement are not winning strategies. I do not want to be drafted, but I also realize that we can’t just ignore wars in Europe and hope it goes away.
In WWI, Germany sought to form an alliance with Mexico to eventually invade the U.S. and in fact sunk many American merchant ships (not to mention, the Lusitania) with a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. Hitler also had plans to invade the US after capturing Europe as well.
