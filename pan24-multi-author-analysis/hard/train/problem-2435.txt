Pretty sure most people aren't actually trying to get famous or even posting much. The general attitude seems to be more along the lines of "everyone has my data anyway, who gives a fuck? Expedia and every other company gave away way more of my sensitive data than I gave TikTok and nothing happened to them, why should I care what the government thinks if they won't protect me anyway. Fuck it and fuck them, I'll get my half hour(or significantly more) of happy brain chemicals/doom scrolls/zone out.".
Yeah. Even the cheapest IP/WiFi-camera's on Aliexpress typically run a barebone Linux OS on multicore ARM SoC's that are more capable than 10 year old smartphones.
Unless isolated (e.g. seperate VLAN), these things can do practically anything in your network and over internet.
2) If the devices exiltrate data they need not do so over the wired network. Wireless transmission to a passerby or a nearby device is possible and could be done in a way that avoids detection.
The fact that it's a camera system could expose other attack surfaces like web browsers and media decoders (god forbid these things come with any client software), on devices that aren't connected to the internet, and aren't normally exposed to these kinds of threats.
3) If you think any government on the planet isn't eager to leverage technology exports for its intelligence operations, you are being naive. It is only limited by the amount of influence of intelligence agencies over tech vendors, and not wanting to be caught in the act. For an authoritarian government like China's, there is no practical limit other than avoiding detection. And given this whole weather balloon fiasco in the US they clearly dgaf.
