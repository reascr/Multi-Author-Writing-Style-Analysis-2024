And yet, come election time, all "y'all Texans" go "welp, he ain't a socialist, so I'm a vote for 'em Derp".
I don't get the dissociative property you Texans have for this guy - you (rightfully so) hate him, yet vote him into office, what, like 5 times in a row?
Unfortunately for Texans, he's not on the ballot this year. We got a lot of other races, like Govener and Attorney General, so make sure that any Texan you know has either voted or made plans to vote tomorrow from 7 a.m.-7 p.m.
we’re getting both and native texans that are both liberal/conservatives leave the state as well… so idk wonder what the balance will end up being lots of non voters too.
I'm uncertain if the influx of residents from CA and other states is really affecting the political makeup of Texas or not. I've heard assertions that we're getting all of the conservatives leaving CA. I've heard that no, we're getting the tech workers who were priced out of living in places like SF and they're liberal.
So, no gerrymandering isn't technically the answer in this specific political office. However, Texas does have a significant problem with it and it's foremost in a lot of people's minds here. So that's why it sort of pops out as the default answer. It's one of many tactics employed by the GOP in Texas to maintain power.
I live in Austin, which is solidly blue as is Travis Co and both have been for some time. Williamson Co actually went blue this last election, which shocked the shit out of me. I thought there were enough Leanderthals to keep it red...
There's a city northwest of Austin called Leander. There's been something resembling 'white flight' out of 'liberal Austin' by conservatives. They're regarded as not being terribly enlightened or educated. Social or political Neanderthals. So.. Leanderthals.
