Exactly. Shoot it down, stuff the pieces in Mr. Blinken's luggage. When he arrives, he can say, "hi, I'm returning something I found that belongs to you. You're welcome.".
Now look at what they said. "Force Majeure caused supposed weather balloon to go off-course. Not intended to violate sovereignty. Please keep a leveled head.".
So... It's a balloon. No propulsion system to put it in any specific spot. Which means it's probably not just recording data to be retrieved later. It's most likely transmitting it as it cruises around the jet streams until it eventually comes down. So, odds are strong that the military is just letting it do its thing while recording the feed to decrypt it. It's also possible that they're analyzing it for what equipment is on board.
It's also possible that they're just letting it float as a "fuck you". Kind of a hard burn to say "your little weather balloon with cameras is real cute. But not worth the time or money to shoot it down.".
True. I have only been attacked ince about white privilege masks ðŸ˜· of all things. It was in a drs office and I was not feeling it. Two words came out if mouth. Then it was,oh sheâ€™s a bitch too.
