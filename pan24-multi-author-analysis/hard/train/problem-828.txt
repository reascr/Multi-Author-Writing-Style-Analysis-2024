We routinely, and correctly, hold people accountable for engaging in speech that creates public health and safety hazards. Of course, Trump encouraged people to inject bleach and take horse de-wormer but his brainless factotums choose to believe that attempting to shut down a dangerous liar who actively politicized a public health issue for political gain is somehow an infringement on a right which does in fact have guard rails. I have the freedom to peaceably assemble and pursue happiness, neither right allows me to stand In The middle of a freeway to protest.
Guns are a huge part of that. There is no credible way to deny that easy access to guns is the largest part of the issue. Until we have gun regulation, like a civilized country, we will see the same absurd rate of gun homicide that we, the united states' experience uniquely.
