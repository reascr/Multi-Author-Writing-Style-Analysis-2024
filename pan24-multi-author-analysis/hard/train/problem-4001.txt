“Of course it bothers me,” Daniel Zimmerman, a 70-year-old registered Democrat, told POLITICO as he left a local pharmacy Thursday in Great Neck, a waterfront enclave in the heart of the district. But, he added, he’d vote for Santos again. “Right now I’m a Republican because Democrats, they’re destroying our country. I don’t like the president,” said the voter.
“Truthfully, I don’t trust the Democrats on anything they say. I see it on the TV and I turn it off,” said the woman, who declined to give her name for privacy reasons.
Basically, at this point, we have to realize that a certain GOP voter doesn’t want truth. It wants to be lied to _in a certain way_. The lady there knows full well there’s a possibility of lies, but her position is not against lying as such, but against a _type_ of (what she considers to be) lying. Even if these people are confronted with irrevocable evidence that they have to been lied to, what matters to them is that the other fantasy, that of the depraved Democrat, maintains its seductive power. The GOO has thus become not unlike the political parties in Russia who peddle nothing but fantasies, lies.
