Plastic recycling is horribly inefficient and incredibly difficult to do for any number of reasons (a huge variety of plastic compositions that each have to be treated differently, food soilage, machines breaking down over things as simple as people trying to recycle plastic films or loose soda caps, etc.).
2. Well I'm an Indian so I can say that while we don't fuck up the environment per-capita wise as much as the west, we do litter A LOT. That's why in many of our cities you will find trash on the road frequently. Its interesting that when we go to other countries we try to be clean but again when we come back to India, we just go back to the same mentality of throwing trash on the roads.
Well my issue isn't that they portray the bad side (and India has a quite a lot of it) but rather its only about the bad side, which makes it sound like its an unlivable place from the outside.
I'm sure India has some nice spots but I can't remember the last post I saw that didn't portray the country as a post apocalyptic disaster.
