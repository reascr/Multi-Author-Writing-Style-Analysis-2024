Or better yet, pack up the whole shop and move to Nevada. No matter peoples politics, you can't have governors running companies. Particularly when the party of free markets and pro business, become that of Nationalist Socialism.
It would take 10 plus years, and billions. That is true. But Disney does need a bit of a rebranding over many years, and you'd be surprised how much of the costs other states would absorb for the move.
But Florida is in a fix, and unless they want their taxpayers picking up Disney's slack in the billions of dollars, or even risking a move, if i were Disney, i'd look at my options.
Genuine question, if Disney were to pull out of Florida, what would that do to their economy? I imagine the state brings in a lot of tourism revenue because of Disneyland, so would their economy tank if Disney decided to leave?
I think one of the major factors foe DW in Fla was having a theme park on bot coasts, nevada puts it too close to Disneyland. The west is running out of water quickly as well.
