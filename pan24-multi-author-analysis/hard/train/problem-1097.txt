Oh, but they do, and it also depends on the crime. Also, white people do not care if black people kill each other. Weirdly, white people will cite crime stats as if they do not commit any crime.
Unfortunately, black people have carried the stereotype of being more likely to commit a crime for quite some time.
It’ll take more than under-reporting crimes committed by black people for that stereotype to go away.
Our system is already set up to over-criminalize black folks. Our society already treats all sorts of things poor people do as crimes in ways it doesn’t for the wealth. And race in the US is tightly correlated to wealth inequality. And black neighborhoods are already super over policed. And black suspects are already much more likely to be taken to trial than white suspects. And racist cops (aka most cops) are already more likely to stop and frisk black citizens just walking around. And they are more likely to pull over black drivers. Etc etc etc.
And then the cops reinforce that pervasive racist bias by using their social media platforms to highlight black suspected criminals at a disproportionate rate.
So you combine all those factors with the historical issue of US culture stigmatizing black folks as inherently criminal or dangerous.
Trying to demand racial parity from them would be silly, because each individual police department is different. Let’s say black folks are the suspect in 11% of the crimes in Polk County. Would you require the Polk County PD to keep track of all their tweets and intentionally feature black mugshots in 11% of them?
