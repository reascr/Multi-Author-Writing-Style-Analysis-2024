That’s the part people like you don’t understand, sooner or later you’ll be in charge and you will get blamed for every shithead in your generation.
Every night when I go to bed, I pray a prayer that I live long enough to see the next generation start blaming your generation for everything wrong.
I pray your children look at what your generation is responsible for and hate you as much as you hate boomers.
BTW, I’m not a boomer, I’m just tired of juvenile minds that want to pin all their problems on an entire generation rather than individuals.
But - without taking anything away from the issues younger generations face, I am honest about what the nation building discourse of the boomer gen looks like. And the difference between it and the examples you’ve given is that those examples don’t steer nations and policy. Boomers - through things like brexit, trump and the like, do.
Interestingly, both in western cultures and east European ones too. It’s them watching the propaganda on Russian state TV.
