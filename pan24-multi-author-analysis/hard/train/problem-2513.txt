He also got significantly more support than the other candidates in the Republican primary. Even within Republicans, he's loved more than the other candidates in their primary. This isn't a situation of "he's the only option, better vote R", it's "we thought he was the best R, so we're going to vote for him again.".
In an ironic way. Does no one see the racist symbolism with Walker being propped up as a (black) puppet for the Republican Party? Which party is virulently racist, again? I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest of Walker is considered their (black) “boy” behind doors and behind his back. They don’t want their “boy” to be a well-spoken Harvard scholar like Obama.
There aren’t two sides when one side is morally decrepit and seeks to deprive the other side of their human dignity. In this case, it’s one side of the argument and a pile of shit that needs to be shoveled away.
Walker’s either a dumbass tool or smart enough to shamelessly milk the white racists’s perception of the dumb black slave persona for gain.
You’re just out here calling a black man “boy” & a “dumbass tool” under the rhetorical cover of alluding to that’s what others are thinking. But no one has said that, it’s all weird projection on your part so all that’s left is you yourself putting those crass ideas into the discourse.
