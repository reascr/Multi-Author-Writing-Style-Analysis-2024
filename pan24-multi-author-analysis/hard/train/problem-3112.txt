The republicans like her more than the democrats. Fox news has been talking favorably of Sinema. So I'm not so sure she'd be syphoning votes from democrats.
My concern isn't that she'd take Democrat votes. My concern is that AZ is probably still a lot like GA, where a Democrat needs a lot of moderate votes to win. It's her winning votes from independents and moderate Republicans that might vote for Gallegos over a Trumpy Republican that could cost Democrats.
Again, it's not about him winning over Sinema, that's not the issue, it's if Sinema will spoil the race and get the Republican candidate elected because she'll siphon off votes that otherwise would have gone to the generic Democrat on the ballot. Democrats who are paying attention aren't going to vote for Sinema, but there are a LOT of low information and moderate voters who would reliably vote for any Democrat in a D v R race, but might go for Sinema in a 3rd person race (for whatever reason, name recognition, prefer a moderate, etc.), and it will only take 1 percentage point or two to throw a race.
Nothing is certain until it is. He can win, but there's no guarantee he will and he ONLY will if everyone that does not want Sinema and lives in AZ, actively organizes and campaigns for Gallego starting now.
There was a similar scenario in the OR Governor's race this past election and it was nail biter, not because the "left-leaning Independent" was likely to win, but because she absolutely acted as a spoiler candidate for the Democrat in the race (who eventually did win but it was far too close).
