Nah, Russian and Ukraine is war between two actual armies, with Russia deciding that war crimes are an acceptable strategy for attrition.
Secondly, do you know how many Ukrainians have been killed by Russian rockets and soldiers? Turkey’s response has been to increase trade with Russia and extort countries trying to join NATO for political gain. Turkey has no problem watching other people get bombed and in fact tries to use that as leverage to bully Sweden and Finland - the contempt held for turkey in the west is a grave it has dug itself.
Let’s be clear: PKK attacked a security checkpoint, and your country is bombing civilians in response. Just because you had an earthquake doesn’t mean Turkey is unaccountable for its actions. And when your own government is declining aid from other countries, I don’t wanna hear that the problem is so serious you’re immune to any criticism for bombing civilians.
Someone gets into conflict with neigbour on the other side of the planet, and US just HAS to show them some democracy, invade or bomb civilians for three months straight, just HAS to (given they are weaker and pose no personal threat).
