How does Putin plan to create this preemptive strike network? I highly doubt the countries currently sympathetic to him (or at least taking the economic opportunities to come out of this war) would be willing to install Russian military hardware on their territory.
Unfortunately I think there are quite a number of countries that would be interested in allowing Russian military installations on their territory if it means they can thumb their nose at the US.
You disagree that Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, etc wouldn't love to park some nice shiny loaner nukes on their land, thereby propping up both themselves and Russia?
If Russia uses nukes, especially first, then all the currently 'neutral' countries that are pretty much there just for the cheap oil or because west bad, they'll turn against Russia. Putin using nukes benefits exactly no one, not even him.
Yeah, it's probably not what they say it is, but they have like 6,000+ nukes. Even if one went off, that would be really bad. I don't think anyone wants to take that chance and risk assuming that not even one of Russia's nukes are still operable.
I do wonder about the viability of Russia's nuclear weapons. Those things are very expensive and can't be put on a shelf for decades and expected to work. For example, the tritium gas in the D-T booster section is radioactive. It's half life is 12 years. It decays into a neutron poison that will play merry hell with the primary stage, and if that doesn't fire at full strenh with the requisite timing, the secondary either misfires or doesn't fire at all, leaving nothing but the high explosives in the primary to make a bang.
