In about 5 years the Colorado may be dry south of Hoover dam, unless upstream parts release more water. It also may not generate power in a few years as the water will be too low, just like Powell almost did and is likely to experience.
Even if the weather were to shift in such a manner to maximize water where it needs to be to support the existing systems it will take decades to restore groundwater and replenish the whole region and its needs. Assuming those resevoirs have a nice season every single year and rise a few % it will take 20 to 60 years or more of net gains to restore things, as well as drastically cutting use of that resource.
We get a new round of cuts thanks to outdated water policies negotiated at a time when very few people lived in the Southwest, and some states didn't even exist yet. Ya know back when the worlds population was 1/4 what it is today.
They got 4% of the world's people and 25% of the world's prison population. How are there not constant riots?!
Oh wow. It was like a conspiracy theory to say what I did on Reddit 5 minutes ago and now its common knowledge. Never know what audience is around on this site.
