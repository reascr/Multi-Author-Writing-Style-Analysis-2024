Erasing other cultures is and has always been a primary objective of Christianity. It's only started to fade very recently and inconsistently.
No, what I said was the opposite of the Jesus quote. Although I think each quote uses "judge" in a different way: the Jesus quote uses it to mean "condemn," but the one I quoted (which I think is from Ayn Rand) uses it to mean "morally assess.".
Yes. Have you ever been involved (or known someone who has been involved) in one of these missions? Sure, some may be scummy, but the vast majority involve real help like building school buildings/homes/wells, providing medical care/etc. They proselytize as well, but to say they're not helping the indigenous people is disingenuous.
If we're talking about colonialism, the inquisition, or jihad that's an entirely different matter. That's far different than "hey have you heard about this God fellow?".
Yeah. I live in South Africa and so we have both. Yay. Luckily the population at large here are kind of okay with LGBT people and we have a good constitution (5th in the world to legalise same-sex marriage for instance). But still. Doesn't mean that people aren't persecuted every day for being who they are. It's just slightly better here than the rest of Africa.
