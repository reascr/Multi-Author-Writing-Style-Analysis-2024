Santos is a flaming gay man in the Republican Party. I might have an idea where his self-loathing stems from.
As someone who has had little to no self esteem their entire life. When I was younger (teens - twenties) I was a compulsive liar. I felt like something was severely wrong with who I was so I would make up things about myself that I thought would get people to like me, because at my core I felt I was wholly unlikable. I’m in my mid forties now and stopped doing this a long time ago, but I still struggle with self esteem daily. I can not tell you how important it is in your day to day life to at least believe you are not a complete piece of shit. I feel shame to this day about the people I lied to. But also I hated everything about myself.
On the other hand, my father is a psychopath level narcissist. And compulsively lies to manipulate because he feels like the world and everyone owes him something at all times. He causes chaos and damage everywhere he goes.
I don’t know Santos. But I can tell you that fundamentally feeling like something is wrong with you as a person can really fuck with your head and send you spiraling down and acting in ways that you would never normally consider.
