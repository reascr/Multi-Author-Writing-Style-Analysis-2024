They’re already filed. They also have a few million dollar bill from rj corman for the clean up and removal of the cars. Honestly didn’t look bad when I drove by it on that Saturday. But damn when they lit it up holy fuck did that black smoke roll. The pictures are crazy.
Yes, it's crazy. I'm very lucky that my business is manufacturing, and does not rely on foot traffic. But the road that we are on is the least used road within about 20 miles of their main hub. So when they need to, they just stop their trains whenever they want, for as long as they want. My road being the least used means that they will get the least amount of backlash.
So trains block to road next to my business about 30% of the time. Sometimes they will park their trains there for literally 3-4 days. I've called the local sheriff, and there is literally nothing that they can do due to the law being repealed.
TLDR - in Ohio, it's 100% legal for Norfolk Southern to block roads with their trains for as long as they want, thanks to having bought off politicians, having a previous law repealed.
About 5-7 years ago, politicians were bought by Norfolk Southern, and a law was repealed which made it legal in Ohio for Norfolk Southern to block roads with their trains at any time, for as long as they like. My business is located at a much more remote location than all of the other areas where their trains intersect roads.
