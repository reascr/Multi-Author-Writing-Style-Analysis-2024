They're foreign intelligence agents committing numerous felonies under domestic an international law pretty much everywhere on the planet. China is so damn high it's ethnocentric racism it literally thinks it's above the law of every country on planet Earth, it's time to, remind them that they're not.
Maybe the idea that you can be ethnic Chinese but nationally American might sway a couple people, or some funny headlines from ccp presses like “America is destroy the Chinese people in her own borders”.
I think this is more of an excuse/rationale to infiltrate the Chinese diaspora abroad like they do in Australia and Canada to exert pressure on them that translates to people more aligned with them in the west.
I’m sorry, but you’re incorrect, They have been known to enact retribution on relatives living in China in order to coerce Chinese citizens living abroad.
Raid every citizen support center, try the put their people in prison for life and refuse to send them home to China when China inevitably whines about it. Hell, put them in Guantanamo with Al Qaeda just to put an even finer point on it.
You commit a crime in another country, you get punished like anybody else. We don't care how rich you are, or how much influence you have, nobody is beyond the reach of the justice system.
