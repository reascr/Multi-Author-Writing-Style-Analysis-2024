This article is a bit trash. No mention of the increased violence against health care workers. No mention of unsafe working conditions and unsafe patient ratios. No mention of exorbitant ceo pay. No mention of increased litigation against nurses or anyone that makes a mistake after being worked to death and overloaded. The system has collapsed already and the system deserves to collapse.
We saw the collapse of our healthcare system during COVID. There is only one solution: Medicare for All. Everyone would have quality healthcare no matter what. It would also cost less.
What that means is they have no incentive to lower costs. Look at the covid vaccine which is going to increase in price astronomically now that for-profit insurance is paying instead of the government.
Insurance companies absolutely do not want covid vaccine costs to go up. Most of them fully cover preventative care like vaccinations. The price is going up because the cost/benefit for insurance companies is to still pay for the vaccine. They’d much prefer the vaccine be dirt cheap.
No? That’s impossible to know and such an oversimplification of reality I can’t possibly agree. I could agree that “if we eliminated 50% of cancer costs would go down” but I’m not going to agree to a broad definition of “healthier” or “less care” or that care and price are a linear relationship. Most young people use very little care. 50% improvement on them saves $0. They aren’t going anyways.
