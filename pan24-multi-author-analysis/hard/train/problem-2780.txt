The worst people ever are running with this saying it wasn’t Russian… most of these missiles come from Belarus. The territory of Belarus is occupied by Russia and the response should be at Putler puppet and russia itself.
It’s more in my opinion a this didn’t come directly from Russia so therefore no drastic measures will be taken (I don’t agree with that but that’s what I believe the ambiguous statement is).
Various western mouthpieces, they haven't said it was Russia, despite having the missile trajectories(according to NATO). And we know it was specifically likely PRODUCED in Russia(which SU-300 is). And Ukraine had SU-300 operating within range of the area that got hit. And we know SU-300 do this kind of thing. It all sort of leads to it being a Ukranian misfire of a SU-300. Or a Ukranian AA hitting a Russian missile and knocking it off course.
If this was just a Russian missile that misfired, NATO likely would have said so by now. They have the trajectory info. If it was that simple, it could likely be figured out in a few minutes.
It really doesn't matter much whether it came from Russia, or Belarus, or from Russian positions inside of Ukraine.
