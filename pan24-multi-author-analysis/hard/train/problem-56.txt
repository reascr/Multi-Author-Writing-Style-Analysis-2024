no offense but I would trust WHO over some Indian pharma companies…the Indian officials are equally likely to protecting their financial interests by denying the claims…interesting they don’t say none of the compounds were found in the medicine, they just say the medicines complied with specifications….
The firm producing the syrup is not really very important to indian Pharma industry but WHO itself contradicts in its own report that all medicines have complied with safety limits of WHO. While i hate the fact this conversation includes the death of kids but WHO needs to clarify how has it put the blame on medicine. Indian officials in health ministry are asking WHO to submit investigation report which WHO is not doing.
Indian officials are asking for the tests and reports which show that syrup is responsible which WHO is not issuing.
Nope WHO is contradicting itself in its own reports but still pushing to blame syrups. Sounds like they are trying hard to push out indian Pharma which makes good medicines at affordable prices to support big pharma profiteering in west.
Also, alas i do not wish to speculate but the west was not clearly "happy" when India was able to make and supply Covid-19 vaccines for very cheap (less than 5$ per dose) to poor countries as big pharma in west wanted to profiteer from it.(compare prices of Indian vaccine with the vaccines produced in west).
