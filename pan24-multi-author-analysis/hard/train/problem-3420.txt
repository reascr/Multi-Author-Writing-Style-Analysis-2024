There’s history behind the low pay and the idea that it is a secondary income is still prevalent. They even told us when I started that having dependents on insurance isn’t covered at all because it is rarely the main insurance in a household. I’m a single mom. It is our only income.
Its not even money. You could pay teachers 80k minimum and theyd still be one of the few careers where you’re expected to work outside business hours, told you’re responsible for not just teaching but community social change, attacked constantly by parents who think they know how to do your job better, and then expected by those same parents to raise their kids. In some spaces in the US teachers are a student’s only form of stability, and they can be rewarded with death threats and physical violence.
Add in the massive student loans they have to become teachers, the threat of school shootings, hostile parents and lack of classroom aides to assist with special needs students and you have to wonder why anyone wants to teach.
How about funding the schools themselves properly so this isn’t an excuse for the minimum salary to be eaten up by forcing the teachers to buy even more school related-supplies?
