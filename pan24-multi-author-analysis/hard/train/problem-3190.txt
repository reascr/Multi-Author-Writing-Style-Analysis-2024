Their main goal is to lift these sanctions, but they can’t because the international community knows- If North Korea is able to prosper- they are aggressive as fuck and have no trust. They won’t cooperate with the world, and will develop weapons that threaten world. So we send them aid when they rattle their sabers but they know and we know if they did anything- they’d be wiped out.
And it also provides a scapegoat to the fact north koreas economy is in shambles due to the sanctions on their country for many years.
The reason North Korea is so chummy with modern Russia is because we've sanctioned their trade so hard that their meager economy has essentially become sanction-proof so there's nobody else to trade with them.
The "Proof" was rail cars going to Russia from North Korea which is something that happens frequently since Russia is one of the only countries that consistently trade with the DPRK.
They're probably getting chinese weapons with North Korea as middlemen so China does not officially support Russia with equipment. Kim is probably only making money by selling them old artillery anmo.
