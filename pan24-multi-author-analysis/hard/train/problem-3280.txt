That’s what communities are for. You’re suppose to take care of each other and as a whole. I’m also not an extremist. I don’t know where I fit on the political spectrum but I think that yes we should have order and law. And basic community necessities but I don’t think government should control what’s taught in schools, what plants you can and can’t grow, what you can and can’t say or do, where you live or how, And what you can or can’t have. And I don’t think they should be able to access our cameras or our info whenever the fuck they want. Im just done with corruption period. Small corruption can be dealt with. When the the ones that control everything are corrupt that’s a problem. And it’s a problem. The people should have more control. And I also think capitalism plays a big part in forced control but that’s a different story.(just look up why monopoly was invented) As long as you’re not physically negatively effecting others you should be left alone.
Edit: that’s what I thought. Next time don’t spew bullshit unless you can do the same for the other side cause it’s obvious which way you lean then.
