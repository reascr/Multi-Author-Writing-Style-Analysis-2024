Revenue is a pointless number when it comes to tax - we care about net profit when calculating tax. We tax companies on the money they make after paying for all of their costs. Your numbers for Glencore alone don’t seem to match up with what I read from them (apparently average tax rate of 30%+) and they lost a substantial amount of money in covid, which would offset later tax payments on profits ().
If someone can find a case where they underplayed tax that isnt due to said company losing more money in the past I’m all ears.
So im not advocating less taxes for the people but more taxes for the big corpos who post reccord profits all the time.
As it says in the article, the first step was to require companies to pay taxes where they earned the profits (i.e. no tax havens outside the EU), so this second step now means that that tax will be at least 15% (i.e. no tax havens inside the EU).
Yes they do - Especially in offshore tax havens. It is called Unrelated Busines Taxable Income "UBTI", typically structured with pass through entities with loans connecting the entities.
