This kind of undermines your whole point that maga voters can spoil elections. Surely there were people who voted Palin and didn't put Begich second due to him not being MAGA enough.
I think you fundamentally misunderstand how ranked choice works. The final round of voting was just between Peltola and Palin, no other candidates, and Peltola won.
Also, from , “In the end, Peltola took just under 55% of the vote. Palin got just over 45%. Palin got a boost once fellow Republican Nick Begich III, who finished third, was eliminated and his 64,392 ballots redistributed during ranked choice tabulation. Nearly two-thirds of his voters chose Palin as their second choice, but 21% didn’t make a second choice – and nearly 12% went for Peltola, who won the two-year term.”.
RCV changes how people decide to vote. With RCV, you don’t have to sacrifice a vote for your preferred candidate like you do with first-to-the-post. There’s a chance Palin could have won without RCV, but given the popularity of Peltola, based on 1st round votes, it would only be a chance and not a sure thing.
Without RCV Palin would’ve lost by even more in all likelihood, since Begich would run a third party race. Look at the 2010 senate match.
There’s no math here that gives Palin a win. Even 2/3 isn’t enough for Palin to win, she needed like 95%+.
Palin needed like 95% of the remaining votes to catch her, and that’s nearly mathematically impossible.
