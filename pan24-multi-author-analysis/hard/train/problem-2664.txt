Idk about Scotland, but in some places, parents not reaffirming their child's chosen gender identity can be considered a form of mental or emotional abuse, and can result in the children being removed from the home. It's already happened near where I live with children as young as 8yrs old.
By legally changing your gender, you are legally classifying yourself as being transgender, and the argument could be made that by your guardians not pursuing a medical transition for you, they are not affirming your gender identity, and are therefor abusing you.
The conclusion of all of these things put together is that you could end up with 8yr olds able to legally change their genders in a couple of months, after which parents would need to pursue medical gender reassignment or face being accused of abuse.
16yr olds being able to legally change their gender in just a couple of months without any medical diagnosis is already a slippery slope.
So really, the situation ends up being that a person could have been in hormone replacement surgery for over a year, been living as a legal adult for over a year as the new gender, but still can't apply for a certificate that's tied to being 18.
Because 16yr old minors who identify as a different gender for a couple of months, and have no medical diagnosis at all, shouldn't be legally and medically changing their genders. At the very least not without their guardian's consent or a physician's supportive diagnosis.
Note: you can consent to medical treatment under 16 and medical staff can make a judgment on of you understand. This is particularly important for obtaining contraception (stay safe).
