They can’t even swear in the rest of the House, the Speaker does that. Until there’s a Speaker, there’s no house. This is the only vote they can take.
Only one minor correction: they need a majority of the votes by name. Voting “present” lowers that threshold because they haven’t voted for an actual person.
The problem is it’s challenging to pull nearly 200 people away from voting in line with party leadership for McCarthy, unless McCarthy himself steps aside. At the moment he looks unwilling to do so.
My opinion - we’re more likely to just see republicans fall in line and vote for McCarthy as he cuts more deals with the holdouts. But who knows! Anything could happen tonight 🤷‍♂️.
They are, kind of. The “other” candidates besides Jeffries and McCarthy have varied from each round.
McCarthy has the plurality on the most recent votes. Of course, he'd have to both be confident that the MAGA 20 that he flipped would stay with him and that the MAGA 20 that weren't flipped wouldn't vote Jefferies out of pure spite (giving Jefferies the majority).
