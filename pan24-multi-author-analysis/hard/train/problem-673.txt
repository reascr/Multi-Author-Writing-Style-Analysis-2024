In most federal districts, there are a handful of judges sitting, and when a case gets filed and hits the docket, it gets automatically and more importantly randomly assigned to one of the sitting judges within that district.
Shouldn't be allowed to preside over a case involving anyone who nominated or confirmed you, and judges should be assigned at random from a pool of all available judges without conflicts of interest.
You don't always get to choose and Judge's still largely follow precedent but if you were involved in a case and found a Judge that perhaps set the precedent you want... well you'll want that Judge to take the case.
Go look at divorce cases, anything prolific will have a shopped judge who leans more heavily one way or the other.
When I practiced family law last century, there were five judges who heard divorce cases. Cases were assigned on a rotating basis. All you had to do to forum shop was ask the clerk who was up next, and then wait until enough other cases were filed to make the judge you wanted be the next one. Then you filed yours. Some judges were better if you were trying to get a father custody of his kid, others were better at alimony awards, etc.
