You are comparing apples and oranges. The 56 GW of installed capacity of coal power comes in addition to the over 200 GW installed capacity they already have, while the 500 GW is included the more than 150 GW they already have. It's also worth mentioning that this is installed capacity, measured in watts, not generated energy, measured in watt-hours. Renewable power plants generally have a much lower capacity factor, which is the ratio of the produced energy to the theoretical maximum energy the plant could produce over time if it was able to run at maximum all the time, than conventional power plants.
How is it possible to believe that non-renewables are being phased out when non-renewables are the largest source of electricity and they are building even more as we speak?!?
It's the second most populous country in the world, and is about to overtake China and become the most populous country in the world, so being the third largest producer of renewable energy isn't the bragging point you think it is. According to wikipedia India is the fifth largest producer of renewable electricity, after much less populous countries, such as Canada. What is important is the percentage of renewable energy, not the total, and only 21.7% of the electricity produced in India in 2021-2022 came from renewable sources, while 72.7% came from coal. 99% of the electricity produced in my country in 2021 came from renewable sources.
U talk about ur country having 99 percent renewable. Bet it has a per capita ppp dollars of atleay 30k.
> India is world's 3rd largest consumer of electricity and world's 3rd largest renewable energy producer with 40% of energy capacity installed in the year 2022 (160 GW of 400 GW) coming from renewable sources.[1][2] Ernst & Young's (EY) 2021 Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) ranked India 3rd behind USA and China.
India is the 3rd largest renewable energy producer. Also check how many nuclear reactors are being built. Some nations just talk. India is walking the talk.
India should look in a mirror when speaking. Let them take the lead and show the world how its done.
