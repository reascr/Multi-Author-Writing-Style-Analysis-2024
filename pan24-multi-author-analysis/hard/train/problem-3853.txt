. I also have worked outside in The rural west my entire life and always wear a big straw hat ( and long sleeves etc) .
In the last few years these Fox fueled fools seem to have now co-opted the American flag and now cowboy hats are seen as a symbol of oppression by many .
I do see their perspective and there are many who fulfill this evil stereotype . ( looking at you Sheriff David Clarke!).
Yeah. I enjoy some of those movies, and a few games made in that style, but realistically, ask most people who dress up like that to do any of that kind of actual work, and they wouldn't last long.
Seems more like they want people and the country to behave like it was portrayed in the movies in the 20's to 60's(or thereabouts). An ideal that never actually existed, but at a time when people were generally more civil towards one another. They want that good old fashion feel good leave it to beaver bullshit, without all that pesky civility.
