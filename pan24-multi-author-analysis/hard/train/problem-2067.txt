Ya, a clearly insignia covered medic was not shot, a man in civilian garb was. Come on, its not even like the article is a long read or written at a advanced level of English comprehension. How much do you people get paid, per hour or post? Post per hour?
As for the teacher, its sad that he lost his life. Then I have to ask was the Palestinian group firing on the IDF in officially recognized uniforms or were they trying to blend into the populace. That is also in the conventions and I haven't seen a single person bring up yet. If a group of people are shooting at you in civilian clothing, and you shoot a person in civilian clothing in that area during the firefight, its not your responsibility. Its the responsibility of the fighters using the civilian populace as a shield. We have this commander that was shot and killed so it was a military operation, were they in uniform?
So to be clear, a guy was walking around the battlefield without any medic vest when he was shot. Being a medic does not create a bubble around you where everyone within several feet is considered a noncombatant. In every armed conflict, combatants walk near medics at some point.
A soldier can also retrieve other soldiers. That doesn’t make them a medic that’s immune from the battlefield. A medic on a battlefield should wear uniform that clearly shows they’re a medic.
You can't expect the IDF to just ignore a possible combatant just because he's stood next to a medic. What happened here is tragic but we shouldn't jump to conclusions until we know more of the facts of the matter.
