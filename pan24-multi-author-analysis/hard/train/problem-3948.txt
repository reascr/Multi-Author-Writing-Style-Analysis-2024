This looks particularly bad because when the Arab World was in charge of the area (1949-1967) all Jews were banned from access to any Jewish holy site in the area.
Of all of the terrible things he does and believes, I think wanting Jews to be able to visit holy sites in their own country freely isn't one of them.
Well maybe if palestinians didn't hate on him for abiding his religion, which he has every right to do - his provocation wouldn't work?
If Palestinian leadership came out right now and said they are ready to accept peace proposal as given during Camp David, it would be VERY hard for Israel to refuse.
The last serious proposal was 2000 Camp David, where Palestinians got pretty much everything they could hope for, and they refused it with no counter offer.
Maybe they did make a mistake in not accepting that, but accepting a 22 year old proposal and moving on is not an option that Palestinians today have.
Also Palestinians agreeing to two state solution and moving on with their lives in peace is not a "surrender.".
