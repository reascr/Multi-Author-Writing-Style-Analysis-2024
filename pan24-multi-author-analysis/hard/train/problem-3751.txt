Postal service oversight is very different than all other executive boards. The Postal Board of Governors chooses, then installs the postmaster general (Louis DeJoy). It's that board of governors that has to vote him out. The president can't do it. The senate can't do it. Only that board of governors.
For DeJoy to be thrown out like he should have been two years ago Biden would have to fire DeJoy's current board supporters, nominate new candidates (note this article claims there currently are no candidates), then have those nominees confirmed by the senate (or recess appointed), then the board would have to hold a vote to expel DeJoy.
That said, Biden has the opportunity to replace two more board members in 6 days giving the theoretically anti DeJoy members a full majority and if there isn’t a call to oust him then I can’t for the life of me figure out why not.
Who cares is that while that’s occurring why wouldn’t the board of generals who have enough people backing DeJoy not just elect a proxy for him?
While I want DeJoy gone and am angry that it still hasn’t been done the argument that the president should be able to fire him is dangerously authoritarian. The PMG is elected by board, the president shouldn’t get to remove that just because he doesn’t like him and is powerful. That’s trumps perspective on the presidency. Presidents don’t get to ignore laws just because they’re the president. Once we’re doing that we don’t have a government. That’s not “oh we should take the high road”, that’s we in a definition sense would no longer have a functioning form of representative government, we’d have a position that can just do whatever it wants.
