point being that it isnt accurate saying that Minnesota is the first, when California did earlier, but the voters have to ratify amendments to the constitution.
Voters in California, Michigan and Vermont ratified proposed constitutional amendments to protect reproductive choice, which is different from "passing a bill." (Voters in Montana, Kansas and Kentucky defeated proposed anti-choice constitutional amendments.).
Yep. This brings to mind the state-by-state effort to recognize marriage equality. Getting legislation passed was very challenging even in blue states like New York and New Jersey. All of the earliest states to recognize marriage equality did so through state supreme court decisions.
Technically, Kansans voted not to amend their state constitution to overturn a . So Kansas hasn't passed anything after Dobbs.
Minnesota was indeed the first state to pass a bill through the state legislature to protect reproductive choice after Dobbs. (, in the next few months.).
Yeah. I live in KS. Unfortunately, all we did was vote "no" to prevent the possibility of an easy abortion ban. Technically nothing has changed here. Certainly women's health has not gained any protection.
