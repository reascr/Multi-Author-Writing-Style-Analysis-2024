About 1 in 5 humans are Chinese. Maybe 'dying' for the billionaire/owner class because their profits are going to go down with less slave labor available, but they'll be all right, not going anywhere. Worse case they'll be suplanted by India and Nigeria's population growth, but they'll be 'okay'.
Exactly. Why would you invade when occupying a country that size would be almost impossible, and buying it all off the oligarchs would be easy? Russia will be come a resource rich proxy state, managed by Russians, owned by the 'People's Republic' (lol) of China.
Translation: China trusts putin's russia to destroy itself to the point China can swoop in and take their resources. Moscow will become New Beijing in a few years.
Xi and Putin take one of these photos every other year. Each year, their body language degrades, and they seem just as surprised that the other person has managed to hold office past their country's intended max term.
American media sensationalizes this because you would think they'd be natural allies, but in reality, their relationship has mostly been modest at best.
