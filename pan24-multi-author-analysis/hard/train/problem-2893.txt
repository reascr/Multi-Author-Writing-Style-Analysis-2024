Twitter has to pay a lot more interest post-acquisition due to a combination of higher interest rates and the leveraged buyout:
It's a leveraged buyout, which basically means Twitter itself is the collateral for that portion of the loans. Musk is responsible for putting the mountain of debt on Twitter, but Twitter the company is responsible for repaying that portion of it.
Twitter was in some serious debt when Musk bought them. And when he bought them he made it a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO). This put even more debt on Twitter and made it so that Twitter would have to pay off the purchase debt... which meant Twitter was now back to being cash poor. And unfortunately Musk hasn't been willing to pump any new money into the platform so they have to work with resources they have.
I guess it's seen as kind of an extreme cost cutting situation to pay no rent on all of your headquarters. That's the sort of stuff you would do if you were about to go bankrupt. It's like... an emergency cost cutting measure. But it doesn't actually save you any money because you're going to have to pay legal fees fighting it and you will be imposed fines for non-payment.
That amount of money is about 8x the operating cost of Twitter. If he really infused $7B into Twitter he could have run it at a loss for 8 years. But it really doesn't look like that. It kinda looks like he's starving out the company of capital.
It's not looking good for Twitter. As an outsider looking in, it kind of looks like they're liquidating the company to try and make as many debt payments as possible to prevent more big Tesla sell offs.
