Plenty of high level Republicans criticized him in 2015 when they thought there was no chance he’d actually get the nomination and he still won.
Well, he's courted the needed Republican base votes for winning the 2024 Republican primary. The most fervent, racist, antisemitic, Q anon, Evangelical and constitution-dismissal wings of the Republican base have all gotten the Trump campaign reach-out in the past few weeks. Trump met up with Kanye and Nick Fuentes, and a prominent Qanon guy, and called for termination of the constitution, covering most of the bases he needs to hit. His campaign has been a success in reaching out to them. They will remember the overtures to them long after news cycle moves on.
Remember, the GOP always falls in line and rallies around their choice, and the feral base of the party steers the whole thing.
The fucker is literally only doing it to pull one last grift and steal what donations he gets and is going to drop out near the primaries. People forget he’s actually run before, there is no doubt that he’s going to do it to get one last payout to pay for his deepening troubles.
I already see it, he’s running again for a final grift to steal donations, he’s going to see desantis pole immensely better during the primaries and drop out taking the money he got from his stupid feral fanbase. All this is is one last ride on the presidential grift train that isn’t shit like endorsing penis inflating books about himself.
