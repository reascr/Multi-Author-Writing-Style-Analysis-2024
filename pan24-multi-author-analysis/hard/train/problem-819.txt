1) The fact that you miss the nuanced difference between the statement "bitcoin, not crypto" clearly shows your lack of knowledge in the area. One is without CEO, board, pre-mine, endless inflation, is open source, has hundreds of good samaritan developers and is the most secure network on the planet because of having the highest PoW hashrate... the other is not.
Firstly, you're confusing me with Festor. Secondly, you fall to the "rules of English" as an excuse to avoid his implication. Bitcoin is leagues ahead of its closest competitor. So no, it's not the same in its meaning and usefulness. You're being disingenuous. It's like you trying to call a bicycle a Ferrari. "But.. but it's a means of transport!". Sure, but it's not comparable and if the difference is not understood then you've got a long road ahead of you. That's why you have significant issues understanding Bitcoin's usefulness for a country like El Salvador.
Bitcoin is a global monetary network, secured by thousands of people globally, making it decentralised and anti fragile. Itâ€™s freedom money, you should take a look.
I see the stats, I see the progress, most of you only read what the corporate media want you to see.
