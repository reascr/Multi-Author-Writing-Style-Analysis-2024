Of course there is going to be a major war. Too many despots ruling powerful countries, the democratic countries are either too weak or too corrupt to do anything, and our planets is significantly overpopulated and running out of critical resources. Add to that everything that comes with climate change, and you have a recipe for a world war.
I doubt a major war will suddenly kick off, but likely a series of regional conflicts will coalesce into a singular war will happen within the next decade.
None of those are likely to expand into a larger war. Russia has expended far too much of their military already. They can't afford to open new fronts.
Israel and Iran are relatively small military powers. Iran is currently experiencing large internal protests.
If the US cuts imports from China, you'll see millions of Chinese out of work overnight and revolting in the streets in the next week. The US doesn't have to militarily fight China.
US isn't going to defend Taiwan. US is already building multiple semiconductor plants to end their dependence on Taiwan. They'll try to delay the invasion long enough to give the industry time to adjust and move to better tech and who knows maybe they'll blow up the plants in Taiwan to make it even harder for the Chinese to catch up but from what I understand western world has already accepted that Taiwan will be annexed.
