I don’t think the comment characterizing redistricting decisions as delivering the House to Republicans is intellectually honest.
Dems have made huge gains in swing states with some trend of over-performing in states with balanced maps or states drawn by independent commissions. Dems are underperforming in NY and CA, where they control the map-drawing. The new NY districts where they’ve lost are largely pro-Biden districts, with some being D+10. Those are winnable races that they lost due to bad state campaigns in NY.
The bottom line is that even with the old maps, if Democrats get the most votes, they control the House. With the new maps, they have the same opportunity and with greater theoretical proportional representation advantages compared to the prior maps. If we end the midterms with less votes for Democrats, will we really blame the courts for them not keeping the majority?
Yeah just wait until the SCOTUS decides that state legislatures can override the will of the people in presidential elections and choose the candidate they want to win instead. Let's say, for example, in 2024 Wisconsin votes for Biden(as they did last time) the Republican legislature would be able to say, "No, we get to choose the president" and they send in a slate of Republican electors instead.
