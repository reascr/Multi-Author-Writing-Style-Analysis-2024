According to the State Border Guard Service, Russians settled in one of the houses of a captured settlement. Border guards were participating in the containment of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation, as part of the Defense Forces. They reconnoitered the enemy position, correcting the fire from the air, using a drone.
"Our mortar gunners recently received a new drone from Chernivtsy volunteers. To thank the caring citizens, the soldiers signed artillery mines and accurately sent signed ammunition down towards the heads of the invaders. As a result, the border guards destroyed the command and observation post of the Russian occupation troops with fire from 120-mm mortars.".
"Um. Why exactly are they doing this, Chief? It literally goes against several basic principles of strategy.".
Yep. Turkey has the ability to stop Russian oil-tankers from getting out of the Black Sea with the mere wave of a hand. They control the Montreux Convention and they decide who is or isn’t violating it.
They don’t tend to make that threat explicitly, everybody just knows that it’s there. Fuck with Turkey? No Bosphorus for you!
