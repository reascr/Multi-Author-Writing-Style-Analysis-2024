They won't: the history of strategic bombing is one of failures. Even the Hiroshima nuclear bomb didn't lead to an immediate Japanese capitulation - they were still thinking they might negotiate favorable surrender terms.
A big part of it was actually a 1945 offensive by the Soviets against the Japanese around the same time - despite the bombs they had hope that the Soviets would be a neutral third party as far as getting favorable surrender terms went.
They were already in discussions with the allies about ending the war before the bombs were dropped but Japan was refusing unconditional surrender or whatever you want to call it. The bombs were to force unconditional surrender and to end the war before the soviets got there. There was a lot more going on than "big boom made Japan surrender".
Also: Japan was already losing. Ukraine is not losing. There is no precedence on what happens when you nuke the winning side.
And the USSR joined in on the war everyone forgets that part. Japan was staring not just at an American but Soviet invasion as well in CONJUNCTION with the nuclear bombs.
The Japanese surrender came almost immedeatly after the Soviets declared war on them, rather than the nukes!
