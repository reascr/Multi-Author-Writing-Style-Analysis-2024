Solid state and suitable grid energy storage should be ready by the end of the decade and will make nuclear options look like they are standing still resulting in them being dead end investments compared to real renewable and energy storage. Newer batteries won't have much rare mineral limits either.
Things are cool, but they're not an effective enough solution to get you down to the emission standards you need in a big spread out country like America.
That's what a climate leader does, gets other countries to lower their negative environmental impact.
Otherwise there's no way a country with one of the highest carbon emissions per capita can be described as a climate leader.
How can America ever call itself a "climate leader" when it's the one causing the problems? America, a country 1/4 the size of China has the exact same amount of carbon emissions as China. Think about that, every single American who complains about how China creates all the pollution requires 4x as much pollution to live their lives.
