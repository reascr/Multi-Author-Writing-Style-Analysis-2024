They call it National School Choice Week. Don't be fooled. The goal is to gut public education, destroy teachersâ€™ unions, and enrich unregulated private education companies.
Destroying public schools and making it to where only rich kids get a good education with expensive private schools does significant damage to poor people.
As a parent of children in a public school district who clearly sees how many homeschool kids end up with a shit show of an education, I don't want school choice. Right now I'm happy with the way public schools work in NYS.
Joking (kinda) - There are arguments better than yours why school choice is bad - the easiest being the outcomes don't improve and instead it drains resources from some districts which need it.
While overall I am against the idea of school choice because it's usually just a disguise for privatizing/defunding public schools, there are the outlier cases where parents in failing school districts have seen benefits to a school choice program.
I think if it was targeted to underprivileged communities and with restrictions in place to ensure it's not going to fund religious curriculum or schools, I could be on board with a limited school choice program.
Yes I'd be more comfortable with a program like that, as long as it's targeted to underprivileged families or those in schools that are proven as poor/under performing.
