We intervene and its going to open the flood gates for all the bad that seems to always come during foreign interventions. The people of Haiti will suffer.
Haiti is a lost cause. They offer nothing to the world but poverty, there is no incentive for anyone to ruin their own reputation and send their own soldiers home in caskets to try and remove shit out of a sewer. And they will just get mad at whoever comes to try and help them, not to mention the problems with foreign soldiers bringing rape and disease. Haitians just need to find an equilibrium state with their gangs, because sending them money so it can be stolen is not in the interest in anyone outside of Haiti.
If we do nothing, Haiti will slowly devolve into an anarchy state akin to Somalia. With mass poverty and no functioning government. The people of Haiti will suffer.
Poor Haiti. The typical third world country. Corruption rooted within since they got freed from France almost 500 years ago. You would expect this to be a prosperous country.
