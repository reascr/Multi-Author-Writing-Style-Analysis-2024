This isn't a new argument. There has been a internal discourse between the pro-premptive party and the anti-premptive parties for a decade. When the Obama era nuclear policy shifted to "allow" (nuclear policy is purposefully vague in every country around the globe) pre-emptive strikes, is essentially when the argument started in Russia. It has thus far not changed, but it is gaining some more traction domestically.
The second point is the nuclear response to a non-nuclear attack for Russia. In previous public discussions regarding this point it was in regards too: "underlined the threat posed by a disarming strike that uses non-nuclear, high-precision weapons against key sites of Russia’s military infrastructure and deterance, telling a meeting of the 2015 Valdai Club that such weapons are “comparable in their effect to nuclear weapons.”.
-For states that possess nuclear weapons and states not in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, there remains a narrow range of contingencies in which U.S. nuclear weapons may still play a role in deterring a conventional, chemical, or biological weapons attack against the United States or its allies and partners, as stated in the 2010 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).
-in case of aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened.
-in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass destruction against it or its allies, and also.
A preemptive first strike is in effect a declaration of nuclear war. I can preemptively strike you any time I chose. Logical conclussion I must remove your ability to hit me before you preemtively remove mine. It is called mutally assured destruction for a reason.
