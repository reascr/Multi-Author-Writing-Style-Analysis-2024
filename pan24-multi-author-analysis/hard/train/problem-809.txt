And it's going to get a LOT tougher still in a few weeks when the expected massive offense is going to start.
Russians don't seem too bothered taking all those losses, I wonder how much longer the Ukranians can keep it up.
Not so long ago, you'd be called a Russian shill for suggesting a Ukrainian victory wasn't imminent.
Because Russia is looking more threatening now, pro-Ukraine Redditors (of which I am one, that's how I know lol) are starting to feel backed into a corner.
If both of those towns are in Ukrainian hands come March, Ukraine will be primed for a counteroffensive in the south and northeast come April and Russias situation is going to become very desperate.
I don’t think Russia will be in a position to keep their southern territories even if they make gains in the east. The Crimean bridge was the only viable logistical route for them and it’s repairs are well behind schedule. But that is the crucial point here. Ukraine with enough weapons to reclaim southern land and cut off Crimea will be able to negotiate from a position of strenh and not just take a “have our land for NATO” negotiation when this is over. If Crimea is liberated or its defense is untenable, Russia will probably capitulate or at least give up on some of its demands.
