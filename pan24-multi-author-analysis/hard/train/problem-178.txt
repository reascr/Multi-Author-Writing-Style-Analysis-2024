Has nothing to do with it. Same reason we have no military. Any nation. who can invade us is already to powerful to be stopped by anything we can purchase.
But I'm glad you agree with me. There is no answer because the reality is that Turkey is incredibly weak.
And about your marvelously brilliant claim about how Turkey is "weak". If Turkey would be weak, Turkey had to greenlit Sweden's membership. Of Turkey would be weak, It's decisions would be easily swayed, PKK would've successfully created their separate state, Armenia would've reached to Ararat, Greece would take Cyprus and western Anatolia, et cetera, et cetera. The fact you can claim Turkey being weak under a topic like this speaks for itself.
Let me remind you Sweden had an arms embargo on Turkey while they were applying to a military alliance where co-defence is the main theme.
The EU may have a mutual defense agreement, but the military response would likely be through NATO. There is no way that the EU could conduct a war without NATO involvement.
Its important to know that NATO is way more precise how countries have to help in case of aggression.
But all NATO allies have an integrated command structure to function through, and this includes key support from the USA.
