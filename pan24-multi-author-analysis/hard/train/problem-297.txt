Scholz did, in fact, approach them about it. But Canada has no coastal export facilities at the scale required for Germany, let alone the EU in its entirety. Most of Canada's oil and gas goes to one market, the United States. It will take years for Canada to be able to export more than a couple percentage points of the quantity required for Europe. Years and investment, the latter of which isn't certain to be maintained, and definitely can't be spontaneously wished into existence to cover Germany's immediate short-term needs.
Qatar is supplying 5% of what Russia supplied to Germany. If anything, the only one that Germany is truly dependent on for gas now is Norway, which covers more than 30% of all gas exports to Germany. Terrible, terrible Norway, oh what horrors does Germany permit by being dependent on them.
Germany is chosing the lesser of two evils for the sake of keeping an essential resource in stock, without which the economy and the people would suffer immensely.
India is chosing to buy cheap oil from russia for the sake of having cheap oil to grow their industry with.
