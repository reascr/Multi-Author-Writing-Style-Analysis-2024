Why are none of them covering the fact that these documents were found and turned over immediately, without anyone asking anyone to do anything.
That is not comparable to Trump having hundreds more documents, and REFUSING to had them over after being asked many many times.
Did Donald Trump intentionally hoard documents that he knew he shouldn't have? Yes. Did he lie about it? Yes.
The Biden administration has always been run 'by the book' (sometimes annoyingly so), so it's highly unlikely that this was in any way intentional. It's not even clear if it was Joe Biden himself that stored the documents.
Simply put, Biden is showing that he can be trusted to do the right thing and Trump proved he cannot be.
After those were found they decided to double check other offices of Bidenâ€™s where they found some more and are following proper protocols.
And I believe this round was caused by Biden and his team deciding to go check all the various locations that they might've handled classified documents in.
Did Joe Biden do the same - intentionally hoarding documents and then lying about it? I see nothing that suggests that is the case. It does appear that someone, either VP Biden or a staffer, was careless and made a mistake somewhere along the line. It also appears that the right things were done once the mistake was discovered, which is what led to discovering additional documents. No search warrant was needed.
