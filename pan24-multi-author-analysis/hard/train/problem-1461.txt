That's what I'm wondering, too. As of last night, the Ukrainian MOD was claiming that there were still somewhere around 10k Russian troops on the west bank of the river.
Crossing the river will require alot of Ukrainian forces to even attempt such a move, and then they run into the same supply issues as the Russians faced.
If the Russians bomb the water infrastructure in Kherson or blow up the dam, they make it much harder to hold onto Crimea.
I suspect the Russians left booby traps all over the city, but they won't use haphazard bombing or artillery for fear of wrecking the waterworks or the pipes.
Is anyone else worried that Russia's left either a dirty bomb (which they'll blame on Ukraine) or an actual nuke to blow away a big chunk of Ukraine's army?
At this point it's a war of attrition, the more Ukrainian troops and weapons Russia manages to destroy the the better for them. There's a limit to how much weapons and manpower Ukraine can lose before civil unrest, or economic collapse.
Sustained combat requires hundreds of tons of weapons being constantly supplied to your troops. Every shell fired from an artillery piece needs to be driven from a warehouse in Russia, all the way to the artillery piece. If you can't get those shells to your artillery, they can't fire.
Now they can sit on the other side of the river and shell the Ukrainian positions for months, with minimal troops left to repel a Ukrainian invasion across the Dnieper. So long as Russia maintains a heavy artillery presence, they can continue inflicting casualties On the Ukrainians.
