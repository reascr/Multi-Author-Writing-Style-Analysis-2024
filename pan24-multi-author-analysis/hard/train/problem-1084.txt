The modern American judicial system: Religious nutbags for judges and no real standing necessary anymore. Also god forbid someone want birth control for the numerous other things it helps with besides pregnancy.
I mean, it’s not like hormonal birth control’s only side effect is preventing pregnancy. It can have some serious and far reaching negative effects like if administered inappropriately. Not to mention the very common effects like headaches, bloating, weight gain, and acne.
I do think there should be a line drawn as to when we allow teens to make medical decisions for themselves. Do I think a 13-15 year old should have a child? No. Do I think that an already hormonal teenager should just be given hormonal birth control because they want it? Not necessarily.
I’m really on the fence about this. I am pro-giving teens birth control, but it is literally the parents responsibility to care and make decisions for their teenage children until they are 18. I mean, they get in legal trouble if their child isn’t attending school until they’re 18 but in your opinion, it’s out of the question that they continue to make medical decisions on their behalf?
Now, I know what you might be thinking, “don’t the negative effects of a pregnancy and subsequent parenthood outweigh the negative effects of birth control” and I would argue that it depends entirely on the teen. My mother had her first child at 16, and while abortion was never an option (Catholic family) she was given the choice on whether or not to be a parent. She decided to keep him and subsequently had 6 more children, only one with any complications and was an incredible mom and she loves it.
