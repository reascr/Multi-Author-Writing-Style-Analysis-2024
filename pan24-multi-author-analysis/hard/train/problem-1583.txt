I.E. India sees the desperation, sees Russia trying to sell their technology to even NATO members and realize that if they get that tech it can give their defense and eventually aerospace industry a leap start compared to both china and the UK. not to mention the potential of capturing former Russian markets that china can't due to differences between the defense standards of china (designed from the ground up) or the west (due to price and lack of experience with said machinery).
to be fair to India, Russia is very open to outsourcing the manufacturing and even design to India which is the whole relation. Russia still has a level of manufacturing which in some aspects surpasses china (who hasn't been able to get turbine designs and manufacturing off the ground).
Not all of these companies/countries are manufacturing engines for fighters at this moment, but all have the design and manufacturing ability to do so if needed.
The hard part is the metallurgy and manufacturing process. All of those companies have that down. Most of them either build commercial engines (which push core temps for efficiency), or are part of consortiums that have designed and built engines. MTU is a major partner in the EJ200.
Of course they don't. There's already more companies making engines than there are companies making fighters. And economies of scale push programs towards sole sourcing the engine rather than the cluster fuck that was/is the GE F-16.
If you're not familiar with the pitfalls of the GE F-16, that's a damning indictment of your supposed knowledge. Hint: the problem wasn't the engine itself.
