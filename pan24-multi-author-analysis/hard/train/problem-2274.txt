My daughter had a procedure last year that the provider didn’t put through until now. We’ve changed insurers.
My daughter got a bill for a doctor and the insurance she was under back then isn’t the same as the insurance she has today.
All the bill says is “if employers cover the costs of transitions, they also have to cover the costs of de-transitions if applicable”.
It matters who covers it because by forcing companies to cover detransitions as well they’re trying to make it so that companies won’t cover transitions in the first place.
You also seem to ignore the fact that detransitioning is already always covered by insurance when they cover transitioning this is just to make them pay even if they aren’t insured by them which jacks up insurance rates making employers less likely to cover transition in the first place.
Detransitioning is also exceptionally rare and even when it does occur it doesn’t require medical intervention in basically any cases but it will still be used to scare companies away from covering those procedures to begin with and gives insurance providers and excuse to Jack of prices on those companies as well to enforce it. That’s the purpose of this bill.
