They aren't honest that's why they are losing power in DC, if you look at the numbers 90% of the deficit in 2024 in tax evasion and the top 1% of income earners also get back an additional $313 billion per year in deductions and credits.
Tax expenditures are costly. For comparison, the cost of all federal income tax expenditures was higher than Social Security, the combined cost of Medicare and Medicaid, or the cost of either defense or non-defense discretionary spending.
