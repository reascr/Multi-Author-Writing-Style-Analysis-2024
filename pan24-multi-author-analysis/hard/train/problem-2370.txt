That's such a disingenuous number about cutting the deficit. That's after a huge amount of stimulus spending in 2020.
Putting it all together, in my 20 years of being voting age, the Democrats have been better with the budget. But that's really not saying much.
But... it is saying much. It's saying a lot. Every time a GOP president has literally driven the economy to tatters, shreds even, it has been a DNC president that claws the way back to a positive standing point for this country. From a negative to a positive every time. Every GOP president has taken it from a good, stable place to the utter fecal-lined-gutters of the middle ages. Without exception. The GOP have padded their own wallets and the wallets of the ultra rich 1% at the expense of every other citizen of this nation every chance they get, and the DNC has clawed back basic living wages, rights, benefits, vacation times, laws against child labor, laws against exploiting and underpaying people, minorities, genders. The DNC has been by a long country mile "better" at all forms of economy than the GOP has. Every time. That's not "both sides," and that's not "better but not saying much" -- it's night and day.
