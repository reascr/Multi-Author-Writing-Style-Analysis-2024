I believe it to be more than some light hearted dithering. There’s clearly a strong focus on leopard tanks for a reason- that reason being that they expect it to give Ukraine the advantage it needs to end the war. It’s incredibly suspect that that’s the one thing your government is being difficult about. This isn’t about the German people (who are awesome), this isn’t about claiming Germany is doing nothing, this is about Germany not helping in the ways that will matter most, which you have to admit, is a little questionable.
I don’t know why people are downvoting you. No one else find it odd that Germany, a dominant European country, is holding things up, and dragging its feet????
Yea. Delivering helmets while the rest of the world delivered AT4 and ammunition. I’m sure Germany isn’t just sitting on their hands like they have been for the entire conflict.
Germany has actually done a lot, but I understand your sentiment. Germany is holding up deliveries of Leopard 2 tanks and they've been unable to explain why.
And not to detract from Polands amazing work, but Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have all given so much for their relative size and wealth. Truly amazing people.
