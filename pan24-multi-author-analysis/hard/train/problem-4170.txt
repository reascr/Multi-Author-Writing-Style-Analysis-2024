This retiring Republican. When you see a headline from anyone other than Fox, or its clones, where a Republican is speaking the truth to their party...they are retiring or lost the election.
Regardless of what the voters want or think, the Republicans will rebrand trump as a failure and force feed the voters DeSantis instead, with their army of talking heads... it won't take long and it's already underway. Just look at people like Lindsay Graham, Mitch McConnell, even doctor Oz (who trump basically put there) plus many others at the top are already distancing themselves from trump. You will also notice more and more talk about how trump is a problem in the media from the republican side.
They will prop up DeSantis and slowly sweep trump under the bus. Obviously trump will not go quietly, but his day has come and gone... the future of the republican party is going a different route now.
I don't think you understand politics lol... Trump can be made to go away if he becomes a problem and he just made himself a problem. By him pushing to have so many failures of politicians running in this election - because he's the King maker - it's showed the Republicans that trump is basically a threat to their success at this stage.
The Republicans are learning a little too late that bending over and kissing Trumpâ€™s ass while regurgitating his crazy conspiracy theories to the media is not a sure fire way to victory.
