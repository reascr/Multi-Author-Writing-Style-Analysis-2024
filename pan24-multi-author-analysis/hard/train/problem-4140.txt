I mean, we actually can't. Think of how many millions of people think Covid is caused by 5G, and how some of them believe this strongly enough to physically attack 5G towers. That is caused by "my ignorance is as worthwhile as your intelligence" levels of free speech.
Free speech is the idea of allowing one’s opinion, but this assumes their opinion is a rational one with some base facts. But the entire idea of acknowledging facts is out the door.
I have no idea what the solution is. Free speech is just as bad as it is good because it can be used to suppress people just as the Republican/Christian nationalist are showing us right now.
Like, yeah, we are fining(and sometimes jailing) peolle for being anti-war, but look at USA There is no free speech there because of cancel culture, its basically the same.
Understand what I’m saying: regardless to all the good free speech offers, free speech can be weaponized. It can be used to suppress and create absolute chaos, as proven by Trump’s GOP or QOP.
