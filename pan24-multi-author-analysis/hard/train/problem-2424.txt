That's great in theory but a little flippant given the unprecedented (for a self-inflicted disaster) misery and hardship that it would cause. I don't mean Biden should cave. But this is a big problem which could hurt a lot of people. That it would be on the GOP is very cold comfort.
Right, I'm not saying we should. I'm saying that there's a difference between "Unfortunately we don't negotiate with terrorists" and "GO AHEAD AND SHOOT THE HOSTAGES LOL LMAO".
Yeah, getting hung up on Congressional salaries is a mistake. We _want_ Congress to be well compensated so that Members don't have to suck up to big business and lobbyists in order to assure themselves a cushy sinecure when they're done in politics.
If it wasn't, would you really want the wealthiest congresspeople who don't need nor care about their salary to be able to bully the lower-income ones that rely on their salary to make rent?
If Republicans are so concerned about the debt, maybe pass laws to increase the revenue on the rich and stop stealing from the poor.
Republicans say they want to cut spending as part of agreeing to raise the debt ceiling but keep wanting to spend millions on these sham investigations.
