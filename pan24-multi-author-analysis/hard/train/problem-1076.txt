Not necessarily. If Ukraine negotiates, Russia might only be able to keep the territory it controls now. Ukraine would still stand between Russia and Moldova. Your theory is essentially the "domino theory" that kept us in Vietnam for a decade.
Right up until Russia starts using nukes. The greatest chance of nuclear weapons being unleashed has always been if a nuclear power starts losing a war. I hope Ukraine wins, but it's not worth WW3.
Oh, piss off. If Putin loses, he's most likely literally dead. You're willing to risk WW3 betting on the rationality of a narcissistic dictator who knows he's doomed. That doesn't even take into account that the US is unlikely to use strategic nukes in response to Putin's use of tactical nukes.
While I believe that he is correct in his assessment of the situation (that heavy weapons will be needed to defeat russia), one does not simply get war ships and air forces. It would be far, far more effective to ask for an umbrella of protection from NATO.
Personally, I do not think this war has a path to conclusion that does not include the destruction of russian leadership. And THAT is where the biggest problem lies... current russian leadership would rather commit global suicide than surrender power.
