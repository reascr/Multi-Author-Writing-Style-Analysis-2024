Deep down, Graham knows what's right and wrong. Whenever the GOP is in disarray, he usually comes out and says the right thing. Like when he said that Trump would be terrible, and after the insurrection when he spoke out against Trump. When the GOP all gets back onto message, he falls in line and starts spouting off whatever the narrative is at the moment. I don't know if they have him blackmailed or what, but it's like clockwork. Some big shake up happens, republicans are conflicted, Graham starts doing the rounds on centrist media outlets saying whatever he wants. As soon as Republicans have landed on a unified message, Graham is back on Fox News saying whatever they've told him to say.
You know shit's bad when even Republicans are finally saying the right thing. Like they're finally starting to get just how dire the Ukraine/Russia war is and how if it's not dealt with soon, we're gonna have a far worse situation beyond just that war. Republicans seemed to have forgotten that Putin is not a stable person and that, until Trump, he was considered a threat to all, to where until Trump, it would have been considered horrible for ANY politician to be buddies with a tyrant like him.
