Not to mention that France & Germany already vetoed Ukraine joining. If anything, the invasion made France and Germany more sympathetic to Ukraine and more likely to say Yes this time around.
I suspect that Ukraine will help if it comes down to the military option. At the very least, they could provide direct support and air defense.
I think that the only way that Transnistria survives is if Russia can push to the border of Moldova. That's not very likely. Unless they can push to Moldova, the place is doomed.
The don't need to do that at all, they just need to fly their aircraft over the black sea and into Moldova. Moldova won't be able to do it alone. They won't have to anyway. They have a willing ally right next door who would love to show the Russians and the separatists the reality that they're facing.
The Transnistrians could well work out that they can turn on Russia right now and that's more likely to get them what they want.
Right now, Transnistria's best path to its goal is not working with Russia but working with Moldova.
Obviously, Moldova does not intend to do that, and neither does Russia intend to drop claims to Transnistria.
Russia wants all of Moldova under the control of Russia, with Transnistria either as a puppet state enabling that control or eliminated once they've outlived their usefulness.
The only easy way out is for Moldova to renounce territorial claims to Transnistria, recognize it as russian/nistrean/independent or in any case, not-moldovan territory and be done with it.
In fact, giving up the Russians to Moldova/Ukraine in exchange for recognised independence (which is to nobody's detriment really) or at least some kind of official devolution of power could well be a very enticing offer.
