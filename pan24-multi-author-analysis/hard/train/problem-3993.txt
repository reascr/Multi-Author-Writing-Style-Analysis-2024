This is not entirely accurate. The FBI knew about the records, and there was an ongoing discussion with the archives. Also, the records turned out to mostly be public knowledge anway.
The DNC wants Biden out. It wouldn't surprise me if they didn't through him under the bus to prevent him from running again. The small loss they would take from that would be nothing compared to the loss if it were Biden vs anyone other than Trump.
I’m not saying Biden didn’t store the documents better than trump. I’m saying that he didn’t obstruct justice by knowingly lying about turning them all over like trump did.
FWIW I don't think anything should happen to President Biden because of this, but to say what has occurred is not illegal is disingenuous.
Second just to play here... Biden's 15 docs isn't Trumps 350 ripe and current national top secrets. Biden followed process immediately upon discovery.
I am wiling to bet that the documents found have a record at the national archives as being sent to him for research and that they forgot to return them.
