Biden’s son is kind of a train wreck, and Biden is guilty of still loving and caring about his son despite him being less than upstanding. But there is zero evidence anywhere that Biden’s train wreck son led to Biden himself doing anything wrong, let alone illegal, and hunter Biden has no involvement in his father’s presidency. Notice how little Biden has said about the tax fraud investigation into his son? And how there aren’t even a single allegation that Biden has done anything to stop this investigation. Hunter isn’t a good look for his father, and Biden could have handled his son better, but fucking hell, seeing this as a scandal after 4 years of trump? Hell, yes, give me political scandals like this one again rather than the president of the US’s attempted extortion of a foreign leader, etc, etc, I’ll take it.
Also yeah Ik the three letter agencies are all corrupt, but like Al Capone went in for tax evasion, this seems to be only thing that’s provable.
The fbi colluding with private companies is dangerous. And of they are going so far for a nothing burger, who knows what they’ve done for consequential things.
Would you get the fbi to lie twitter and Facebook, and call pictures of your son’s junk Russian disinformation.
I don’t think anybody is faulting Biden for acting like what any father would’ve done. It’s the fact that he/ people that work for him, used govt agencies to violate first amendment rights.
