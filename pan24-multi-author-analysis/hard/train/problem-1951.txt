3. A lost challenge to some kind of administrative court or body (probably - based on how things are run where I live).
Where I live, the [State] SC is selective about the cases they will hear, you need some kind of grounds: this is a new legal issue [no precedent], the lower courts messed up, or some grounds for disagreeing with the appellate court's decision [other than, "I disagree."]. The supreme court is busy, and doesn't hear every Joe, John, or Harry who is mad about something.

Regardless: this is moving surprisingly fast. I'd be surprised if she actually got to the supreme court (federal or state).
It looks like she said she would go "all the way to the supreme court." Unsure if she meant State or Federal (or both?).
Yep. Any discussion of Trump's VP has to understand that the biggest priority is not doing the thing he hated Pence for: allowing the election to be certified.
