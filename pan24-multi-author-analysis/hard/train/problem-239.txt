If you create a caricature based on a tragedy which killed 21000+ plus people and what’s more, on the exact same day as it happened, you are a horrible person no matter how noble your intentions are, there is a thing called “time and place” when choosing to do or say something.
A lot of people interpret it in such way, I would too if I were a victim of this. If a caricature was misinterpreted by most people as you say, then it’s a bad caricature.
I mean those which are mocking/harsh, freedom of speech allows it and it’s good, but making a harsh and offensive caricature in the day of the tragedy deserves every bit of harsh backlash it gets.
Some people seem to think that freedom of speech shouldn’t protect speech that is offensive or controversial but that is basically the whole point of freedom of speech.
And I am happy we have Free Speech so that we can be confronted with ideas that might initially offend us, but which might also have the power to change us.
In a less free society, the cartoon would have never been made, never been published and the minds and intellects of society would have never been challenged or enlightened.
