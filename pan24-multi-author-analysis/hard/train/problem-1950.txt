in today’s world, the global media and pr power that brought Zelensky to his current recognition, could do the same for literally anybody and create countless Zelenskys. In these grand matters about the world, lt would just be too naive to think him as a hero who stepped up. I’m sure the same loci of power can create another Zelensky if something would happen to him. Russia is an arch enemy for the USA led West world and Putin is the villain -both of these are absolute truths. Now if you could just add an innocent (enter Zelensky) the classical scenario in order to initiate the West to bring justice and redemption is ready for serve. Just like a hollywood movie it’s the same story all over again with some contemporary nuances.
the whole world? really? like i mean how about countless f’d up countries in Africa where unheard of atrocities are a part of daily life, should we also ask them to march? I’m asking because no one gave them a f till now and it might just be a bit weird to ask of them something like this. Besides there are many places on earth like africa that we have to consider the same question for them as well.
I'm sure many countries will do that and that's good, not sure about the whole world tho.. definitely not the middle east, Africa, most of Latin America or Asia.
Well there you have it. Overwhelming grassroots support for Ukraine is only in western countries, as well as Japan and South Korea. The rest of the world which is the countries I've mentioned are all neutral at best.
