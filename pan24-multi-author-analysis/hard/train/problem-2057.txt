Like this entire thread is on world news and it's talking about the French police and everyone is talking this is the American police or I guess in your case Australian. I'm like I'm doing a cursorary investigation here and I'm just not seeing anything. I understand that a lot of cops suck but this thread is getting kind of ridiculous.
So I'm just looking at the comments and I'm going to assume that everyone assumes all police officers are Fascist. I mean okay I guess every country's police is a bunch of douchebags what this doesn't make sense guys.
I mean yeah sounds bad but what does their politics have to do with anything I don't really care if a cop is right or left leaning as long as they're doing their job right. My belief is there's only a good cop and a bad cop.
LoL, ‘killing cops to make the main character richer is ok. But doing it because contextual they are fascists is bad.’.
And yeah, if instead of attacking fascists, you would attack black people, I would dislike that. That's why I'm glad that's not the case.
