These protests are going to have to change power on their own and lots of Iranian people are probably going to lose their lives going against their corrupt and backwards government. I don't want to see another Arab spring intervention which cripples Iran as a country and drives it into civil war, I just want to see their damn regime replaced and 50% of their population finally be seen as equals.
I think anyone brave, honourable and intelligent in Russia has already been killed, locked up or has fled the country to look for a future life where you aren't under a corrupt and brutal dictatorship.
Also, last I checked, Russia's overall standard of living is a bit higher than Iran's, which is definitely a factor in both why so many Russians are apathetic and why they aren't exactly rushing in to die for Putin and his yachts, palaces and oligarchs. They have to be forced to do it instead. Apathy, not support, is the dominant feeling in Russia.
A lot of the Western misconceptions about Russia like the one you mentioned are exactly what fuel Putin's murderous and illegitimate regime.
He said in the following years (after the interview to Ekho Moskva, but before this latest expanded war) that a new democratic Russia would try to resolve the question in a legitimate way.
