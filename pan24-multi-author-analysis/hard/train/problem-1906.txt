oh great, now they use 1000 times as much plastic for those containers the food comes up. They better not have garbage cans because you know people will throw them away.
Yes, especially if they go in the trash. If we update our systems and they can be put in with food waste then they are composted.
As to Methane, that depends on if the restaurant was lying about composting. The bamboo itself when it breaks down does not release methane. The methane in a trash dump comes from the anaerobic bacteria releasing it as a waste product as they break down the bamboo. Compost heaps use aerobic bacteria, which does not release methane. They will release some CO2. but its no where near the 30:1 ratio that methane is as a GHG vs CO2.
As to billionaires, theres 3100 of them globally vs 8 billion people. None of them are polluting 2.58 million people worth per year no matter how many jet flights they are doing. The studies that make it sound like they are always tend to include the companies they are owners of, which is bullshit cause those companies would be out of business if we stopped buying from them. So yeah you can blame them for having an outsized emissions compared to working joe, but working joe is still vastly the majority.
Food? Vegetarian diets are time and time again proven to be cheaper and healthier. Problem is you dont think that cause youll buy the shitty five pound tube of beef at walmart, but when you think vegetarian, suddenly you shop at whole foods.
