I imagine you disagree with this. I also imagine you've never read either her scholarly work on statutory construction or constitutional interpretation, or her appellate or Court jurisprudence.
Politically, overturning Roe and Casey was "exactly the reason" she was appointed, or at least an explicit motivation of primary importance.
You no doubt disagree, so why don't you cite either her actual appellate or Court jurisprudence, or even her scholarship on statutory construction or constitutional interpretation, and explain how it is faith-based, as opposed to law-based? Let's dig into this religious legal reasoning of hers.
She’s unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of her radical and bizarre religious beliefs not the least of shock, speaking in tongues. Anyone who holds to this belief is psychologically unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
How on earth did we come to the place where we are urging Supreme Court justices to not let their personal beliefs colour their decisions. Seriously? It’s like an episode of the Simpsons where Bart becomes chief justice.
