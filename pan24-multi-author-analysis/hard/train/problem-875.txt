Well that certainly is a nothingburger of an answer. Wtf were their reasons that you "get"? I certainly don't "get" any of the stated motivations for brexit.
I think brexit was stupid but itâ€™s disingenuous to pretend that there were not legit reasons some people might be disenfranchised with it.
Pay no attention to the 'remoaners' , people who voted in favour of Brexit had their reasons and to them those reasons were sound.
Should've been an easy win for labour, but instead they kept voting in unelectable leaders, making idiotic plans pandering to their most radical base instead of swing voters and dithering on Brexit.
Dunno mate, I'm in my 30s and as much as I hate the tories they are starting to look like the only viable party to vote for.
I would rather scoup out my eyes with a rusty spoon than vote for any of the nationalist-tinted parties.
Labour constantly saying stupid, populist and very destabilizing things. Some of my favourites include "let's nationalise everything" and "Let's abolish the house of lords".
