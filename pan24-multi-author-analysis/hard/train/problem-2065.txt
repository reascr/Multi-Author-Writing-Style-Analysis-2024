Several associations representing Ukrainians living in Italy have also protested against the choice of Mussorgsky's classic work at this time. They have called for a different opera to be staged and for no Russian works to be put on until the war is over.".
This is incredibly stupid. The Russian government they're protesting against didn't even exist when this piece was made. Nobody was going to use 18th century Russian art to justify Putin's fascism.
"Kartysh accused Russia of "using culture to lend weight to its assertions of greatness and power" following its invasion of Ukraine in February.
Have fun listening to Russian culture which Russia wants to spread bc it's superior while genociding Ukraine and erasing theirs. Hope u have a blast.
Don't be daft and obtuse. I never said that. And it doesn't matter who the authors / composers are and u know that. The point is being a part of / celebrating Russian culture by going to this.
If you don't feel disgusted and understand how this is celebrating Russian culture AND at the worst possible time, than that's on you.
Have fun enjoying Russian culture while Russia is genociding a country. If u don't feel like u are covered in blood, that's your issue.
