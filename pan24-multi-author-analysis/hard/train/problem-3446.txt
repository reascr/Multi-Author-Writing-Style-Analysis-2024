So I was a national guard soldier in Arizona during one of those “deploy the guard to protect the boarder” type situations. Around 2010 time frame.
Yeah i was out in 2010, so not quite as recent as you. Things were definitely changing, Obama wasn't super terrible for the military but the wartime boom was over and austerity was creeping in. When i got injured in a non duty accident they were super happy to cut their ties from me with a medical discharge.
I was a combat engineer then quartermaster officer, I've seen it from the enlisted and fighting side as well as the commissioned and supply side... Texas ain't got the money to be "victorious" in the things they say they want to be here.
They have to do some show, and it's really expensive, so the paperwork and the man hours even if your not running the machines is a financial disaster.
Texas has operating budget of like 50 billion dollars. Obviously they can't spend it all on a national guard deployment, they'll be easily spending 3 million a day to field m113s and the troops.
