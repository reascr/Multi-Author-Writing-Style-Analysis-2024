I'm not against this but this really needs massive investment from a top down approach or it simply become like plastic "recycling" where it's a feel god narrative that simply doesn't happen the way it's sold to public. Preferably government investments for renewables that is owned and retained by the state.
Tax credits are fine but a rebate is better. As for roof solar it's good but the problem of renters ending up paying higher costs in the long run is real problem while the subsidize the landlords investment because you know the won't be passing any money back the renter when electricity prices rise due to the infrastructure overhaul.
I suppose my problem is not that people who can afford the outlay getting money back but that whole sections of society who can't will be hit hardest.
If the government is really serious about this, there shouldn't be "financial incentives" but a complete cost subsidy. Make the whole process just a phone number the homeowner calls to schedule installation, and never sees a bill. Until then the White House will get few takers, especially since inflation is hurting everyone each trip to a store, and wages aren't keeping up with inflation.
