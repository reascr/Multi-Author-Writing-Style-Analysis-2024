Crazy the crimes one person can commit and see no consequences if they’re well connected. What the fuck is he? King of America? Lock this fuck up for fucking fucks sake. Jesus Christ, is our justice system really this transparently a joke? I spent the night in Jail for blowing under the legal limit and driving too slowly, we can’t put this fool in jail for any of the crimes he’s committed?
He has been eligible to be charged with any crime committed in office for almost two years now, so the "you can't indict a sitting president" excuse is long gone.
One of these claims actually ending with an indictment and charge would be the first that wasn't complete bullshit.
If he isn't charged, I will accept that, as the process has happened and a determination has found that the evidence wasn't there.
If he is charged will you accept that they found enough evidence to make that a reasonable step to take?
I don't know that he will be charged. You don't know that he won't be. I haven't seen the evidence. You haven't seen the evidence. I dislike him for what I have seen he has done. You like him for what you have seen he has done.
