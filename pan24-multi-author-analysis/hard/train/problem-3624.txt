I think you’re misunderstanding what is being referred to by the term. “Zero-COVID” is what China’s policy for handling the spread of COVID has been dubbed. It is a thing that exists. Whether or not it is _effective_ in achieving its aspirational aims is another story. But by insisting there is “no such thing”, you reveal your misunderstanding of what is being discussed.
I can see you’re ducking and diving the “zero-COVID” thing, but I’ll assume you’ve realised you were in error. Also, in a more recent study, Sinovac has been shown to be no less effective than mRNA vaccines, at preventing serious illness and death (Source: ).
Although 50% effectiveness is far below the greater than 90% real-world protection of COVID-19 vaccines made with messenger RNA (mRNA), it may still be good enough to curb the disease's spread.
In any form of democracy all knowledge is shared and we work together to find a solution to a common issue.
Here is the medical science behind sinovac (Sinovac Biotech) or CoronaVac. A vaccine developed by a Chinese company, that is only about 50% effective against symptomatic COVID-19.
