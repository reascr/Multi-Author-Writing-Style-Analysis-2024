Lol bullshit. No one goes to jail in Russia or China for dancing and they are without a doubt strictly authoritarian. There's levels. And religion takes things to a whole new one.
Thatâ€™s a different kind of cult. That started as a cult of personality around Mao. Quite typical of communist dictatorships to replace the original local cult(s) with a cult of personality. Same difference.
I have no issues with faith, but putting a name on it and framing it within a non-democratic organization opens it up for exploitation, just like they were designed to be. Religions are just personality cults around personas that can no longer die and thus render themselves useless as tools of oppression.
Reducing Religions to "just personality cults" is disingenuous to the history of faith based structures of thought through history.
Constructing any amount of organized structure around anything can lead to exploitation and corruption as power becomes centralized, this is not specific to Religion.
The concepts I enjoy focusing on tend to deal with meta-physical spaces. In focusing on these concepts it becomes necessary to not only question my external world, but my internal world. This ties in a lot with context of existence, personal identity, perception of reality, among other things. Much of these concepts have no scientific methodology for specific measurement so it's not as though it can ever be "proven", these are all concepts that rely of faith. I don't think anyone should be discouraged from exploring their self or their faith. Religion can be a useful vehicle for that exploration. Problems arise when people try to influence that journey of personal exploration. Those people can use religion to have that negative influence, but it is not religion which is negative, it is people's desire for control.
I mean that religion is a form of government - a means of control of a population. They create rules. They have followers. They have leaders. Religions govern.
