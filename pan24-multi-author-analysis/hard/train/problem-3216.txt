That's a big security risk right there. If they were really a bad player, they could break into some military site, load up their account password reset tool, reset the password and get into the system without anyone even knowing. This is equivalent to like losing the admin password to your PC and emailing Microsoft so they can give you a code to enable you the ability to reset it.
And how do you trust any previous/future system/camera updates/firmware upgrades to not have any backdoors/hidden exploits?
If an IT tech/contractor at a government department doesn't know that P2P is a security threat, we probably have bigger problems than a few cameras...
I presume the mass usage of China made cameras in public offices is down to budget managers/bean counters having the final say when ordering technology rather than security experts. In the long run an own goal for China but $B's made in the short/medium term. I suppose now they shift manufacturing to a third country to avoid the "Made in China" stigma...buyer beware.
