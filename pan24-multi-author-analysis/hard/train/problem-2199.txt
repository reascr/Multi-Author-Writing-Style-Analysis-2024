The EU is unconditionally by Ukraine's side. When it comes to the beef between China and the US, the EU remains mostly neutral. That could change if China was to provide Russia with weapons to prolong this war of aggression. I sincerely don't think that's something China wants to occur.
I truly hope they don't and I'm not advocating for Russia-China here, but... If I imagine myself in their shoes, this "red line" warning feels a bit empty considering the west already crossed it, no? Or am I forgetting an obscure international treaty that would make all this legal and normal?
US and the west did take side to provide arms to Ukraine so, why would China not be allowed to pick a side too?
i stand with ukraine but telling china not to provide weapons to russia while the usa do the same is literally hypocrisy.
China states “the U.S. is the one pouring weapons into the Ukraine conflict, not china”. The US is pouring weapons in to help Ukraine bolster their defenses from Russian attack. China would be sending in weapons to aid a Russian attack on a sovereign nation, two very different agendas here. China is also claiming to seek a peaceful resolution to the war Russia started while contemplating sending weapons to aid Putins attack.
