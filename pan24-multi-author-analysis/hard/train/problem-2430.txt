Israel has gradually increased the scope of aid to Ukraine from zero to humanitarian to sharing of intel, especially about the Iranian arms. Also, Israel recently approved NATO to provide Ukraine with weapons with Israeli-made components including fire guidance and electro-optic systems.
So, yeah, Israel is increasingly flexible in Ukraine's favor and is pushing the boundary on approved aid further and further up as time goes by.
Israel is helping them alot btw (one example: the idf built and been operating an hospital in Ukraine, maybe more than one there), not supplying weapons though. And about asking Israel for Iron dome while they don't have enough of it for themselves this ridiculous.
Out of curiosity, could you name one time that Ukraine helped Israel? name one time Ukraine voted in favor of Israel in the UN?
Again Ukraine's UN vote same as Azerbaijan's vote changed nothing at the UN. Just another weak political excuse for blocking lethal aid.
You make the same argument, Ukraine didn't do anything for us so why should we help? It's short-sighted and weak. Israel knows all too well how much help it needs to survive. If nothing else, Israel should stay close in policy to their biggest allies, the USA and Europe countries, and who they sanction and support.
"We’re teaming up with Russia and Iran who are attacking us, and distancing ourselves from Israel — which we want as an ally".
