In WW2 we sent people to their deaths to retrieve intact enemy equipment and we are getting it for free.
This is also why we have been giving gear like this. People get mad about the US requiring Ukraine to defend itself before giving advanced gear. What country would willing give its good shit to a country that would hand it over to the Ops?
Facts. We also have intact top of the line tanks, IFVs, helicopters, AA, radars, and jets from Russia.
I seem to remember that the Russian tests of hypersonic missiles have not been very successful. But for argument sake, let’s suppose they are very effective and Russia can put such weapons in range of DC.
And speed running all the fellow nato countries rotating out all their old (often soviet) hardware for new American weapons.
That’s what I hate about the argument we’re just giving Ukraine a $40 billion+ blank check. We’re not. We’re either buying everything on behalf of Ukraine from American weapons manufacturers (hello American jobs and Lockheed stock prices), or European countries donating old jets and tanks and we buy new American weapons for our existing nato allies. I honestly don’t think Ukraine is getting any actual cash, and if they are, it’s very little. As in just to pay their soldiers and stabilize their central bank. We give pallets of cash to corrupt shitholes were warlords and dictators and no one bats an eye.
