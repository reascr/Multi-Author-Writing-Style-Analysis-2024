The elementary school near my home exploded one Sunday morning in 1967. It destroyed the kindergarten and first grade rooms. Because no one was there, a horrifying disaster became only a minor footnote.
Over 4,000 children get lifelong asthma each year, because of methane leaks from not only home gas stoves but also gas fired water heaters and space heating.
The current research shows that gas burners could have an elevated risk of contributing to childhood asthma. Nothing is set in stone yet, but here is the article that most people are pointing to .
Its funny how people on here are claiming that 'Democrats coming after gas stoves is ridiculous' but then there's people defending doing just that in these comments. If manufacturers can create an induction stove that people desire over gas, then people will go for it instead of the gas. Until then I would support a little sticker on the box explaining the risks to consumers, and if they still want gas let them have it.
Gas burners are far more responsive to adjustments can quickly heat up or cool down. You can char food right there on the exposed flame. You can light it if the power is out. There's a reason if you go in pretty much any professional kitchen you will not find electric stoves. If they were just flat out better wouldn't chefs prefer them?
No but some cities have been trying to ban gas stoves for new housing developments. Franky I think its pretty ridiculous and I think people should be able to buy whatever appliances they want for their house.
100 years from now, people are gonna look back at us as insane for building these huge gas networks for our home kitchens.
