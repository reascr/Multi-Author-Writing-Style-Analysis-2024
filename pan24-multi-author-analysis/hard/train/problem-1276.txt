But it's also important to realize that upwards of 10,000 migrant workers died building these stadiums that will probably never be used again.
At what point do we look at this and say "This is just a sport, why are people's lives being ruined just for the world to watch a fucking sport?".
Yep. Qatar pretty handily showed that most folks have few morals or values when it comes to voting with their wallets, and that many people in the Western world do not care that 10k slaves died to build a one-use stadium in one of the hottest, and politically most regressive/medieval, places on Earth.
Amazing to me how low FIFA & the world cup can sink, yet the vast majority of people still brainlessly watch it and support it whilst pretending to care. Qatar pegged their audience well, and this is quite the propaganda win for them with very little oil/blood money investment.
"I don't care about politics" is a pretty weak excuse when politics affects everything in our lives. The landlord, the banker, the police officer, the farmer, and everyone else who can impact your life very much cares about politics whether they admit to it or not.
