"You see selling water from the drought plagued Colorado river to the Saudi's was a good idea. Very smart. The woke left have infiltrated our government we should be selling all of our natural resources to foreign countries! No one is tougher on the Saudis than me and my children.".

There are a ton of those garbage conservative "news" sites that are allowed here regardless of the amount of straight up lies that they print. Fox "News" is a good example. Their trash, lie filled articles are allowed here. If right wing articles are quickly downvoted into oblivion that doesn't mean that they aren't allowed here, it's just that most of the people who frequent this subreddit don't like lies and right wing propaganda, and make their feelings known by downvoting them until they disappear.
