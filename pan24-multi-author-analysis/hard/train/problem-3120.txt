Valid point. It would also make me nervous that "we need more laws to get more prisoners, because we need more organ donors" could be a legitimate political take.
We do need prison reform tho, and something like organ donations in prison would need extremely strict oversight with severe punishment if abused.
They're adults and it's their bodies. They can do what they want with their organs. If they want to help another human being who needs an organ that is a commendable act and they should be rewarded for their selflessness.
I'm all for prisoners donating organs voluntarily, but when it's used as an incentive to shorten a prison sentence it's essentially holding their organs hostage.
not apples to apples, but Dr Jack Kevorkian had a revolutionary idea to allow prisoners on death row to voluntarily donate organs many decades ago, as described in his book Medicide. He wanted allowing people who are already condemned to death a way to have something good come of that, but all the methods of death used then destroyed every organ that would have been harvestable had the prisoner agreed.
