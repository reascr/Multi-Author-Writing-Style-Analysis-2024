Another group of Russian mobiks lost in Ukraine. They trained for months to become artillerymen, but after arriving to the "DPR", were turned into assault infantry and ransomed by locals for fuel money, or else they'd be sent to the frontline.
I took part in a G7 ministerial meeting at the invitation of Japanese FM Hayashi Yoshimasa. We focused on everything needed for Ukraine's victory in 2023. There will be rapid deliveries of weapons and new sanctions. Russia must realise we won’t tire of countering its aggression.
I don’t doubt that orders have been issued by Putin to launch various offensives. But I am skeptical that Russia is actually able to achieve any build-ups of capabilities right now.
I guess that's technically good soft power work of the kind Russia appears no longer capable of. Regarding visas and such, however, nations have a responsibility to behave and not go Hitler 1939 on their neighbours. If that inconveniences Russian citizens abroad a bit...tough shit. If that inconveniences Westerners in Russia, I'm sure it doesn't compare to Russian red tape.
