The Iraq invasion wasn't about bringing democracy to iraq or removing a dictator, that was a secondary or even tertiary goal. The real goal was geopolitical and geostrategic control over the middle east as well as resources.
The only difference is US did not annex Iraq but it did occupy it for several years and screwed up so bad that after they were gone Iraq became a failed state that quickly fell in a the hands of Iranian influence and or terrorist organisations.
Ukraine was also stashing weapons, ammunition and armed vehicles in the salt mines as well.. so obviously it does have strategic value and logistical value.
The Iraq invasion did have similarities to the Ukraine invasion in terms of geopolitical and geostrategic motives as well as breaking international law. War crimes as well as humanitarian crisis happened in both wars.
Make no mistake, both sides of this war are suffering tremendous casualties, but it's for very different reasons. Ukraine is fighting a much larger country, while Russia is constantly suffering from its own incompetence. I can only assume all this Russian propaganda is meant for internal consumption because on the world stage is falls flat.
