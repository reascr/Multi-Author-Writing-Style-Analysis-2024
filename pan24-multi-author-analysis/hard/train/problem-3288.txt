There are times and there are times. ww2 proved that there's no such thing as true "neutrality" when there's a large nation doing imperialist invasions in Europe. There are times when things aren't clearcut, but this isn't one of those times.
For a country that suffered under tyranny more than twice, you have to be surprised at Austria being such wankers about this.
Austria suffered under tyranny? Twice? They participated in Nazism more than anything, the idea of Austria as part of a Greater Germany was popular in the interwar years.
Well yeah there are for sure a lot of ignorant comments flying about... a quick Wikipedia check would confirm that Austria isn't even in NATO and besides, there's no mechanism for kicking out members nor would it be the right thing to do with Turkey or Hungary even if it were possible.
Austria aren't compromised and they aren't fascist (also can we stop calling everything we dislike fascist? It cheapen it) . They are following their foreign policy to the letter.
