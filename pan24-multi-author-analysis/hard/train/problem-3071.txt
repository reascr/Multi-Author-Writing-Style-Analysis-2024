The issue with this logic is that near everyone knew Trump for his hate speech, racism, lies, and anti-democratic proclivities even before he stood for President in 2016.
Republicans tolerated Trump's very overt racism, bigotry, fraud, and even his fucking violence and treason... so long as they believed that he guaranteed them power. Now that Trump is not a guaranteed path to power the Republicans are trying to pretend that they have any scruples to speak of; this is theater. If the current shifts and Combover Caligula becomes their best means of gaining power in 2024, they'll suddenly all be back on board with him and all of his bullshit and they absolutely will not give a shit about it.
How to tell when "enough is enough" for Republicans: does the person in question have power, or provide a means by which power may be attained? If yes, then there is no bottom, absolutely nothing is off limits, power is all that matters. If no, then they need to be done away with ASAP because their stupid bullshit might prevent/stall/slow the acquisition of power.
