This is important, with the collapse of the USSR being a good example. Everyone hoping for Russian revolution/collapse doesn’t understand the absolute chaos caused by the dissolving of a nuclear state. Putin needs to go, and Russian needs to GTFO of Ukraine, but it’s probably best for global security that Russia retains a “functional” government and military.
Somehow the current status is the preferred option for NATO: let the Ukrainians do the fighting, but overload them with weapons so that they can win and remove Russia as a threat.
It's the ukrainians that are at fault here because they don't want to stop defending their country, don't want to negotiate with russia and give some of their regions to Russia. This all Zelenski's fault not saint Putin.
I'm sorry, i was being sarcastic. I understand why you missed it though, there's a lot of infuriating comments like that in here.
I'd understand why some of you might not think i was being sarcastic here because i've kept seeing a lot of infuriating, stupid, dissapointing posts like this on social media everywhere, especially in Twitter and YouTube.
And they're only going to stop attacking for a few years before they do their special military operation again, just like how Crimea wasn't enough for them before the full invasion of Ukraine.
