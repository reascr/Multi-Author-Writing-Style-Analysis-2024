My question is how do you decide why gets it and who doesn't? Do you get money just because you are black or do you have to provide evidence you are decendent from someone that was a slave? What about all the other groups that have been discriminated against?
There's a direct connection between the property that taken and the people that it was returned to. Are the people who receive reparations going to have to prove a direct connection to someone that was a slave?
There's no case for black reparations and anyone who thinks there is probably just lying to themselves.
I often wonder the ratio of useful idiots to class warriors among those proposing and supporting race-based reparations.
Seems to me like focusing on race-blind antipoverty measures and other reforms is a better way to try and make things better for disadvantaged groups.
Plus half the time if you look at the actual policies folks calling for "reparations" suggest, it's basically just something like "let's invest more in disadvantaged communities" or whatever - the sort of stuff that could be done in a race blind fashion anyway.
And let's remember that there's various examples of policy that's de jure colorblind being enacted in ways to effectively exclude disadvantaged groups. This is of course reason to be cautious with colorblind policy... but on the other hand it does present an opportunity. If technically colorblind policy can be crafted in ways to effectively hurt or exclude disadvantaged groups, it should also instead be able to be crafted in ways that can allow it to effectively be more likely to help people of disadvantaged groups.
Calling it class reductionism is a fallacy used by people interested in the very strategy the parent is complaining about, turning what are primarily class issues into divisive race issues, pitting the lower classes against eachother and ensuring nothing gets done.
