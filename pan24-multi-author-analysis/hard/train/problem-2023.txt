Russia has borders to protect, republics to police, an increasingly inpatient population to control.
If anything Ukraine may have the upper hand in attrition, no sanctions, western weapons freely flowing and seemingly the personal to man the equipment.
Russia can outlast Ukraine in equipment, but they're not going up against Ukraine for equipment - it's Ukraine and the rest of the world, while Russia is heavily sanctioned.
The longer the war goes on, the worse the equipment situation will become for Russia, and I bet Ukrainians are being trained on more and more western equipment. The US military industrial complex has a license to print money that the rest of the world doesn't hate for once. I wouldn't bet against that.
It likely won't. What rarely gets widely publicized is Ukraines losses and setbacks. In a war of attrition sadly Russia has the capability to outlast Ukraine in terms of equipment and personnel.
Didn't the German army had it's own calculations that were proven wrong because Russia just keept bringing in more troops and equipment?
