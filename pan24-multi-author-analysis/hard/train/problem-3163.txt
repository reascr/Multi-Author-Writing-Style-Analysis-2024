Genuinely curious, since you don’t really hear about Moldova even though they’re so close to the conflict and will be greatly impacted by the result of the war.
Would do no-one any good for Moldova to enter the conflict, because as you mentioned their army - similar with many natural countries- is almost non existent. Maybe they can divert some of the rockets from Ukraine to Moldova.
I don't see how the Russians can effectively threaten Moldova now, they could bomb it with missiles but can't safely reach it.
Russia isn't very well equipped for a maritime assault though, their Black Sea fleet is trying hard to stay out of range of Ukraine. Not that they'd meet a lot of resistance in Moldova as their army is laughable, so a relatively small force could capture it.
Accepting the current lines and turning their offense to Moldova would give Putin an easy win, which his ailing popularity desperately needs.
It makes some sense for Putin to take a weak nation now, but Moldova without a land corridor, seems to create a lot more problems than it solves. I guess Putin could then conscript Moldovan men into the Russian military to bolster numbers and let them do the dying for him. He'd need a lot of troops on the ground to supress resistance to that so it seems too complicated all in all.
