People want better life for themself. There is nothing wrong with this desire. In Middle East and Africa it is also trendy to migrate.
The avalance of Iraqi migrants is partly due to Iraqi population DOUBLING after 2003 war started. War and poor conditions increase birth rate, in this case to developping country level. That war was pointless and now there is also this backlash. I bet we have this same issue ahead in Ukraine in 20 years, altough I hope it will be itself a rapidly advancing and properous EU country by then. If not, the young Ukranians will migrate into such countries.
What EU should do in long run, is make effort to better the conditions, rights and safety of the people in their own countries. There should be legal ways available for people to migrate, instead of using human trafficIng.
Immigration is fine, but the people who migrate need to learn and adapt to the society they live in. That means learning the language, building relationships with locals and accepting the host nations values.
The UK tried an open door policy in the 00's and it built up a lot of resentment in the native population, it didn't help people complaining were immediately labelled as racist (some/many were, but it shut down discussion on the integration issues).
As a fun example a lot of British people retired in Spain. They never learnt the language, insulted johnny foreigner in their own country and generally transposed some of the worst aspects of British culture.
