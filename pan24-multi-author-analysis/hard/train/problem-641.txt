Well, I can't speak for everyone, but my country keeps 10k troops there fully armed and spooled up. If a fight comes, they will be there, and I don't see my country just hanging their battallions out to dry. They have air and ground assets, and I'm quite certain after watching this debacle that 10 battalions highly motivated and fully armed and supported by air assets would mop the floor with these russian battle groups. Once you throw the poles themselves in with their soldiers who are also highly trained and motivated..... russians stand little to no chance in that fight. Especially once an extra squadron or two of f22/F35 shows up escorting a handful of B series bombers..... good lawd. Just typing it out paints a picture of death and destruction of epic proportion.
I believe that is probably the case. It's quite tiring watching them all play the trickle effect with these weapons. I really wish they would just start loading ships and let the Ukrainians get this party started. Start training a few battalions today, and let 'em eat once the shit finally makes it to theater.
Anyway, for the poles' sake( and anyone else that would be involved) , let's hope this never happens. But if it does, I damn sure hope there's as much footage as we're getting from Ukraine.
I'm not saying this to insinuate Poland should act in one day or another concerning jets to Ukraine ( although, I wish they would give them a squadron) just to point out that they would have whatever they need for defense of their people. Also, it doesn't matter anyway. pootin doesn't pick on countries that can fight back, he just made a grave miscalculation with the Ukrainians!
That said, what the article points out is that Poland doesn't have enough F-16 jets to make a proper contribution to Ukraine. We'll need to get greater military powers on board in order to supply them.
