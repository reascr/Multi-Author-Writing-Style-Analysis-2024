Ukraine doesn't need to attack Moscow, it has no military value. Attacking it would create public support. They would never attack Moscow.
Well, why wouldn't the Russians intensify their attacks as a result? I would have thought that the cycle of retaliation would continue for a long time. Why would you think the Russians would rethink their approach?
Russia is full of doublethink. The country of survivors. Everything past pure survival is a luxury. Think of it what you will.
Russians society is very atomised. People only care about their immediate circle of contacts, friends, family, etc. Everything else is "whatever, leave me alone." Including the war.
In this war? Yeah, they're right. There's minimal if any military hardware in Moscow, and all the military structures are going to be hardened against bombardment (against the like of the US bombing them). So bombing Moscow is relatively fruitless militarily unless they want to target civilian infrastructure, which would harm the Ukrainian war effort.
