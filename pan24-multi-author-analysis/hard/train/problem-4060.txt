Hunter is a side show now, the impeachment will be over the classified documents. Hunter will be involved to the extent that they want to place him and the documents at Joe's house at the same time, so they can baselessly allege that Hunter probably copied and sold them to China or whatever.
I don't think it's implausible for Hunter to have dropped off a malfunctioning laptop at a local shop in Wilminon if he was there visiting his father, and simply forgot to pick it up before flying home. The repair quote has a date on it, if Hunter wasn't in Delaware on that day he could easily prove it. The fact that he hasn't done that, or even explicitly denied the laptop story, strongly suggests to me it's true.
That doesn't mean the laptop ever actually belonged to him or that all of the information on it is real.
So while no one is saying everything is fake, because it's not and doesn't matter, everyone did say the laptop was compromised, because it was and that does matter.
So the data on the laptop is clearly real, but the story of how it was obtained is clearly bullshit. However, there is in any sensible way. Giuliani almost certainly bought or bartered with pro-Russian Ukrainians for the cache of stolen emails and then came up with the laptop story to explain his possession of stolen data.
