Imagine hitting a team with yellow cards at the start of the game..... because they have the word "love" on their jersey.
Edit: What makes this even more ridiculous: The word 'love' is on the inside of the official player shirts. It is NOT visible. Fan shirts do have it on the outside, but those are already produced, banning 'love' won't win from capitalism here.
News here in Belgium has a lot of critique on the decision. The official WK tv show on our national televison already called it a disgrace at least a 100 times. Public opinion is on the good side.
The players, coach and staff are complying because it is their job to do what the federation says, but they are not happy about it. Although they are ratter reserved when the topic arrises in interviews. I think personnal and professional life clash a bit here, but if you are paid millions, you stfu and do as asked, I guess.
We'll probably, and sadly, comply this time. As I understood it, football federations of those countries had a meeting and decided a yellow card is a bridge to far.
