Gotta wonder how much MAGA donations to Trump sucked that money out of what midterm Republican candidates could have received if Trump weren't trying to wring as much $$$ out of the MAGA flocks for as long as he can.
Granted, the typical Republican may be a few 6-packs short of a case, but even they tend to learn from electoral mistakes.
The republican party is built upon flawed people, everyone grifting and bending the truth. It has no structure, it has no plan.
It actually does have a plan. They came out and said it, explicitly, a few administrations ago: obstruct, delay, kill, slow. Wherever a Democratic agenda tries to go, the Republican agenda has nothing to do with the goal itself, its goal is only to trip up the progress toward the goal, whatever it may be.
This was stated more or less blatantly and in so many words by Republican leaders during Obama's first term, rankled as they were at him having the audacity of being both black and president at the same time. Nothing has improved since then, since the gleeful encouragement of Trump and his me-first/me-only/me-all-the-time philosophy and their woefully mistaken notion that they were somehow included in his egomania. The party has been poisoned by hateful philosophy, and cannot force itself to look in that particular mirror.
