Trump admitted that he abused our trust and broke his "sacred" oath to intentionally allow thousands of people to die...to make himself look better, i.e., keep himself in power, politically.
Yeah, maybe. So let's put him just a hair above the murderous mullahs on the evil scale. Good job, Donald!
But your argument is that that's not as bad as ordering the execution of thousands of people to keep the mullahs of Iran in power?
Why don't we use the CIA to fuck up the Iranian government like we did to countless governments in South America?
Can't help wondering where Iran would be today were it not for the fucking CIA wagging their penis around back in the 50's. There's always an argument for the necessity of such organizations, but good Lord at the evil shit those fuckers have done.
It wasn't a policy. The CIA (in conjunction with the brits) collapsed the Iranian government in 1953, steering it into whatever they thought to be the lesser of two evils rather than letting the Iranian people make their own turd sandwich.
