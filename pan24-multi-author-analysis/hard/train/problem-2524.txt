And as the article points out, they gave money to both parties, so why do only the Democrats get the headline here?
>Crypto exploded under Trump's regulators. Crypto billionaires were donors to everyone, and the most ardent backers of crypto were Republicans like Patrick McHenry and Pat Toomey. The right went all in on crypto, the Dems only half.
But but but Democrats got some donations from crypto billionaires! Yes, the Republicans got them too, from the same sources, but it's the Democrat ones that are "a problem".
Yes (see Snopes article below), and the patents trademarks were fast tracked the moment Trump took office. And the Trump admin made a sudden 180 on ZTE, after ZTE supposedly violated sanctions. The US had levied a 7 year ban from US suppliers for ZTE. Literally ONE WEEK week after Ivanka's patents trademarks were fast tracked in China, Trump admin directed the Department of Commerce to help get ZTE back in business, lifting the ban. I wonder why? LMFAO.
The voting machines weren't even really the biggest conflict of interest, it was really just the patents trademarks in general, along with the ZTE bullshit I mentioned above. Trump has sold out the United States in 100 different ways, from patent fuckery, money from Trump tower, and of course the stolen classified documents which he undoubtedly sold to foreign interests, along with the mysterious $2 billion that Kushner got from the Saudis. It's all egregiously traitorous.
People expect (and many are perfectly fine with) Republicans being tied to dirty money. For example, Trump received over $5M from the Chinese government while in office, in one of the more egregious conflicts of interest in American presidential financial history but nobody seemed to give a flying fuck:
