Of course we know Russians don't care. If you happen to take the wrong turn, you might get sent into a truck anyway.
It allowed volunteer recruits from other nations, similar to a foreign legion, because Putin tried to recruit Mongolians and North Koreans who lived near Siberia.
"Effectively, Putin has allowed both foreigners and Russians with residence permits in other countries to be drafted into the army.".
This is very true. The people fleeing are way more than those who died. However it is hard to pinpoint exact numbers because many who fled from Septembers draft have returned (of course many won't return). My point is that while this whole situation will shift somewhat the demographics, it will in no way create the "dating paradise" that many Redditors think will happen. If one can't get any women at a society of roughly 50/50, then a society where it's tilted to say 40/60 won't suddenly make them a Don Juan.
The men who have died so far are a drop in the ocean in terms of demographics changes. Russia has 140 million people. If only a third of them are men (which in reality it is not that exteme imbalance anyway) and half of them are dating age (which again, is very rough estimate) then that leaves over 22 million men. Let's say Russia continues this crazy war and doubles their losses to 220k dead next year. That is about 1%, nowhere near as extreme as one would expect the situation to be.
