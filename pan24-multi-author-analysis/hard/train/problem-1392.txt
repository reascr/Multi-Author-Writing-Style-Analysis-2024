The millions of acres that were agreed upon 80 years ago has allowed California to feed the country. 1/3 of all vegetables and 3/4 of all fruit come from California. That doesn't include dairy or almonds or alfalfa. Obviously there should be some compromise to ensure clean water is fairly distributed but it's p disingenuous to insinuate that CA is some water greedy tyrant.
It would be reasonable, in my opinion, to have some controls on the utilized water during a multi year drought relative to the kcsl return on water investment, after the basic water needs of the community have been addressed (obviously those needs would also have constraints as it is a drought).
With reduced water feeding into the system, the only way to restore the Colorado is take down the dams, and restore the natural flow for five years and measure what is left.
they could use desalination plants to get enough water to setup a closed system where all the water gets reused, thereby freeing up the colorado river for the midwest.
The water being taken from the river is being shipped to unsustainable homes, farms and businesses so time to move them or supply them with a sustainable water source which would be solar powered water desalinization.
CA has first dibs. AZ knew this before they went crazy building houses, aka roasting ovens, in the desert with no known water supply.
