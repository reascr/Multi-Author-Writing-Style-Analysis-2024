Registration has been used to confiscate legally-owned firearms in nearly every instance it has been put into place. It is never introduced in good faith, it's always one step in the process of future confiscation. It has been used that way in those three countries, many more globally, and in various states in the US; The end goal of registration is always to confiscate firearms, even if it hasn't happened yet, because the people that want registration are the same that want to disarm citizens.
Since you're listing The United States there, and the United States currently leads the world in gun possession, I guess you're not talking about widespread or indiscriminate gun confiscation?
That's not meaningless. That helps reduce mass shooting fatalities. That's different than addressing general gun violence, but not at all meaningless.
The issue isn't a gun issue(I mean a nationwide ban on handguns would help but I don't see that in my lifetime). It is a disinvestmemt and poverty issue that will take more money than chicago or the state of Illinois are willing to muster in order to fix.
There are things that state lawmakers could do that would help chicagos gun violence problem, however many things are more in the wheel house of the city so funding would be a key to those.
There are more but those are the 3 big ones the state can do that would make a real dent in addressing gun violence in chicago. But they are not easy fake wins that the state party can wave around that they are "doing something".
