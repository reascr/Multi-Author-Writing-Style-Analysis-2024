Except it works. It's indefensible to people who are sensible but I guess most people aren't, because they keep getting away with shit like this in every way that matters.
They spout one line of bullshit for a while, creating chaos as reasonable people try to address the insane garbage. But once that like of crap is no longer useful to the fascist they drop it, and head off to new, fresh bullshit. That’s what we see Greene doing here.
It isn’t because she and her fellow Republicans are so much stupid, and they aren’t gullible-they know they are lying. It is be because that are intentionally doing bad things.
(Normally I change the term “anti-Semite” when including this quote from Sartre, but for Ms Space Lasers, it fits, so I’ll leave it.).
Oh yeah. It sticks out that they never, EVER refer to them as anti fascist and I’d wager good money that a large portion of the base doesn’t know what antifa is short for.
It was a performance art installation at a Republican convention. It portrayed the “patriots” that were “unfairly” detained for storming the capitol. Fucking ridiculous.
