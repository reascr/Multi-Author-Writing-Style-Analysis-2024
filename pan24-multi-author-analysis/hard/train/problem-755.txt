At this point, nothing the Russian Leadership says or does has anything to do with us in this context.
Okay, bohemian Russian-bot, but why not make good on such a deal, when instead, you have alluded to “control” over European energy, and/or open war on the land you intend to claim?
Well maybe they could get out of Ukraine and return to the pre-2014 borders and stop invading their neighbors and start acting like a normal responsible country instead of an aggressive wannabe empire.
If Russia is kicked out by force, reparations could well include a transfer of Russian territory to Ukraine (obviously I don't mean Crimea or their newly annexed "oblasts" or whatever).
At some point I think there will eventually be a peace deal that gets Ukraine crimea and the Donbas back, but to prevent Russia from being an asshole in the future, the terms will not include reparations or accountability for actions.
The reason I think this might be okay is that Russia will crumble even without needing to pay reparations or hold its officials accountable. If they get kicked out of Donbas and crimea, Russia is going to implode as the strong man illusion of its leadership disintegrates.
