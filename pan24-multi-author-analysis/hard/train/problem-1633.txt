The reason they want to up the retirement age is because Republicans have used social security as their personal piggy bank for decades now! Need to pay for a war, take it from social security. Need to pay for a tax cut for the rich, take it from social security. On and on. Now they don't want to pay it back. That's what it really is.
Yep. And until we grind everything to a halt, we’re gonna end up regressing 100 years or so as far as workers rights.
If it’s half assed for sure. But if everyone just stops. I’m talking about every Starbucks employee, McDonalds, front line Apple workers, airline workers, railroad workers, office employees-literally everyone in the 99%. i think that would cause real damage to the rich.
But seriously, we (Americans) need to just stop working- just don’t show up and refuse to show up until the rich see that we are not gonna put up with this anymore and start to change things for the better of everyone.
It's insane and horribly depressing to me that the US is one of the richest most powerful nations on the planet and overwhelming majority of the work force can't afford to retire before 60. What the fuck is the point of life if you go to school for the first 18-24ish years of your life then work into your late 60s onward. What the fuck are we doing?
Both sets of my grandparents retired in their mid 50s and died in their late 70s early 80s, and one is still alive, they had decades after retirement to just live their lives.
My dad was 65 when he died, he had mentioned a few months before he was gearing up to retire in a couple of years (I assume he meant 67). And the only reason I'd ever be able to retire is because he didn't have the opportunity to spend that money on himself.
