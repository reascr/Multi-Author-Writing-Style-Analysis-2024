Yes, the early successes may have largely been helped by rumors that US intelligence was able to surmise basically the entire plan of the early Kiev Offensive, allowing Ukraine to adjust and prepare anti-air defenses, which stopped the VDV’s raid from being able to adequately secure a flight path for reinforcing infantry at Hostomel.
If the Russian incursion into Kyiv had been successful, and they had successfully captured and held the airfield long enough for reinforcements and materials to be air lifted in, the conflict would likely look very different than it does today. That’s the only thing that comes to mind that would have placed the invasion in Russias favor. But, thanks to the heroism and courage of the Ukrainian defenders (and a shitload of western weaponry), Russia is getting mollywhopped.
Yeah, it was a huge blow to ordinary Russians' morale too (to those who weren't in the state of perpetual shock & disbelief already cause we consider Ukranians our brothers and the war was unimaginable).
