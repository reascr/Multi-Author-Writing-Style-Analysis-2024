He says a lot of things. [So we shouldn’t worry about pushing back against the inflammatory rhetoric of a current presidential candidate who was just in the White House, recently received 70+ million votes, and has a large devoted following. Yep, we shouldn’t be bothered to worry about that.].
Some context. Trump has never accepted the outcome of any election. Trump even questions the one he won because he did not win the popular vote and in his narcissistic mind that is not posable. Trump proposed suspending the 2020 elections. Trump wanted to fire everyone that would not support him in overturning the 2020 election. Trump motivated his white nationalist base to try and overthrow the government. Trump claims that as president and a former president he has absolute power to do anything. So when Trump says he will ignore the constitution he means it.
Trump says Constitution should be tossed aside so he can win. MAGA says "you have to take him in context.".
Biden says that part of the Republican base are dangerous extremists. MAGA distorts his context to make it seem like he called ALL Republicans dangerous extremists.
