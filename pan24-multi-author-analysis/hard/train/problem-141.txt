Considering how things went for Republicans on Tuesday, I have no doubt that without the new gerrymandered districts, Democrats would have expanded their majority.
Ask yourself what the midterm elections would have looked like if Democrats hadn't passed an infrastructure bill, or a prescription savings package, or invested hundreds of billions in climate change mitigation, it might not have moved the dial much, but it wouldn't have to.
Without the ability to pass legislation the job of advocating for the Democratic party falls on us, the folks who want to see them elected and in control, Nancy Pelosi can't force action in a majority Republican House, the minority party has practically zero power in Washinon, DC.
A bill can only be brought to the floor of the House for a vote by the controlling party, if Republicans have control of the House they just won't bring Democratic written or sponsored legislation up for a vote, meaning that House Democrats will be able to pass any legislation whatsoever that they can show to their voters.
Republican voters will show up for Republican politicians no matter what, but Democratic voters have a tendency to expect and even demand results, this is okay when Democrats have the ability to produce results, but if Republicans hold control of the House then Democrats can't do that, Republicans won't let them.
In 2010 Republicans won the House of Representatives, in 2012 President Obama was reelected but turnout was down a bit compared to four years earlier so Democrats didn't win back the House, in 2014 Democratic voters were so disappointed with the lack of progressive legislation coming from the Republican House of Representatives that that year's midterms had the lowest turnout in three quarters of a century.
