Well, nordic countries celebrate all the Christian holidays, marry in churches and get baptized but I don't know a single person here believing in God.
They are Christian, since lot of those Nordic people, even though they don't believe in God, are part of the Lutheran church and also and babtized, and thus they are counted as Christians. They often even call themselves Lutheran or Christian, as they still are part of those religions, even without believing in God.
They can still be culturally Muslims, like a lot of Jewish atheists are culturally Jewish and in North America a lot of us atheists are culturally Christian.
I never said there weren't religious people, just that the Nordic countries aren't typically religious countries, my country of Sweden is believed to be about 80% atheist.
Not if one asks what they are in open context open question, but if asked in religion related context, I think large part of nordic people will answer they are whatever their country's Lutheran church is called. And we do not even have all that much "day to day opinion influencing to steer our religion, culture and habits to certai direction" or "finding common identity" drive to it, compared to what I would expect those people to have.
Also at least how it has sometimes in some news has seemed, there is some ammount of occasional "bundling some people as group to main identity: Muslim, even when not talking religion related things" going from different directions in different medias. Sometimes on purpose with different motivations, someties accidentally.
