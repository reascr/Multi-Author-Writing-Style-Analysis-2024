California appears to be the source for its own crime guns 85% of the traces. I think that really blows out of the water the porous borders argument people use to defend Californias failures to address its gun violence.
Considering how large California is, the fact that only 60% of its known guns are coming from in-state purchases I think does somewhat lend to the fact that the gun problem can't be solved completely within California, because a large number of guns are still coming in from out of state. And when you compare it to Texas, where 85% of its known guns are purchased in state, I think it proves that guns are being bought elsewhere and then brought into California.
TX expanded the age for gun purchases down to 18 (from 21) which gives approximately 1 million more Texans the right to purchase firearms, an increase of about 5%.
> While the official minimum age to own and carry a gun in Texas remains 21, another law that came into effect in September allows people between 18 and 21 to buy a handgun.
Finally, tighten up existing gun laws, stop the idiotic "constitutional carry" and add severe fines, including imprisonment for gun dealers who "wink and nod" about cash purchases and require "gun shows" to follow all requirements for gun dealer licenses.
Finally, finally, hold permanent gun buybacks in every locality, funded by the federal government, if necessary and find better ways to remove guns from abusers and people with private armories.
