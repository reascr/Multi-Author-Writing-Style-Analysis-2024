I know. I'm just clarifying a misconception that people have about Hispanic people. Some people think they're all mestizos which is not true. There are white people in those countries who even the nazis would consider Aryan, like white people of German descent who are all over Latin America. Latin America had the same waves of immigration from Europe as the US had.
The nazis also had slaves. They enslaved the Jews and other "undesirables" who were strong enough to work. Those who were not considered "useful" were murdered.
Yeah, too many people think Hispanic is a race, and it's not. Hispanic countries are just as diverse as the US and contain white people as well (and some of them happen to be nazis).
Like I’m Puerto Rican and I’m still white, even if not all of my ancestors were. But I also have cousins way darker than me who are more supportive of idiots like Fuentes. I mean, look at Kanye….
To be fair, it's only Kanye's side saying this. I did a Twitter search and didn't see any pics ir definitive proof.
