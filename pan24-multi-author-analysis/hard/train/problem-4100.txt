Hi TinaToner311. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics. However, has been removed for the following reason(s):
Edit: I noticed you deleted your previous comment. Tell me again, who is spewing nonsense? You weren't even aware that Twitter is now a private company.
And no shit Twitter is a private company. So then how do you know the value of the company? How much is it worth?
How do you figure? It wasn't profitable before he got there, hasn't been for a long time. There was a lot of unnecessary employee bloat. And he said it would be weird for a while because they're doing a little experimenting.
Lmao keep gobbling up bullshit ass news sources. How would the user base grow and they lose more money than before? That makes no sense. And who at Twitter was better at running a company than Elon?
No way, news sources would never all collectively lie to form an agenda. Like they did about a certain laptop now they're starting to admit the laptop is real..whoa...
Oh yeah FOX always tells it like it is... you conservatives in that laptop. You know who actually walked away with billions from Ukraine? Kushner and Ivanka. Haven't seen a single headline there. Why don't Republicans actually do something that American people care about?
