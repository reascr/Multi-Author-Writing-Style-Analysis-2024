A Russian website has over 10,000 confirmed deaths, mostly by visiting cemeteries and culling social media posts. But the Russian military is widely believed to be hiding large numbers of dead soldiers, and the Ukrainians have reported having large numbers of Russian bodies in freezers that the Russians won't take back.
US intelligence thinks the Russian death toll is 100,000 "killed and wounded". There's reason to think that the Russian dead-to-wounded ratio is around 1:5 (US would be at least 1:10, because of body armor, advanced medical care, etc. The historic ratio is 1:3 in most wars).
I suspect it's a bit higher, just based on the ferocity of the fighting. Maybe 30k Russian dead and 90,000-120,000 wounded, but I'd be surprised if it's any more than that.
So, with all that, it's reasonable to assume the Russians have lost around 20,000 dead and 80,000-100,000 wounded, as a very conservative number.
What stuck out to me was the disparity in the number of Russian deaths the article reported from one source and what Ukraine has been claiming. It's a huge difference.
