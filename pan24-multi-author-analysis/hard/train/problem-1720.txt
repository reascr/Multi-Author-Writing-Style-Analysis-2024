Edit: since i got a few replies how Elon didn’t cause it, i wanna specify a little bit. The problem with bot farms and disinformation is obviously much older than when Elon took over twitter. However he gave it a boost and made derailing valid criticism (in this instance of ccp) much easier.
This is what absolute “free speech” acording to authoritarians or would be authoritarians like Trump leads to. Dismantling all regulations to allow social media being overloaded by so much bullshit, that it effectively censors all rational discussions. In the end it only helps fascist regimes like China or Russia what Musk has done to twitter.
Granted, Chinese Twitter has always been more on the NSFW side. If you were to click on the profile of any political poster, whether for or against the CCP, there's a moderate chance that you'll see some rather unique interests on the profile. But I'm pretty sure that usually it isn't this bad and spammy, especially on the city hashtags. I'm guessing they're using nsfw spam because it's plausibly deniable in the context of Chinese Twitter.
Their target audience is most likely other Chinese citizens who are looking for uncensored information on Twitter. At least according to the top article.
