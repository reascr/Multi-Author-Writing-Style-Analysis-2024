Great idea, as your armament factories are being blown up by mystery drones, send your warships to outside of the range where they can be useful defending against such threats, to posture and show 'how great and big and good and powerful and...the regime is'. (eyeroll).
How is taking your naval warships away from your home turf, that just this weekend got bombarded, not a good strategic idea?
Why are you so butthurt about a warship sailing in international waters anyway? Also I don’t remember the US military returning home when BLM protests were happening all over the White America. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
First, you support a paranoid interventionist government, who was also behind a coup against Iranians democratically elected leader in 1953 that fucked with Iran’s political development. Then, you claim to sympathize with Iranian citizens who became the victims of the US fuck ups!
Instead of trying to make Iran a better place for the people, the leaders are more worried about torturing innocent civilians and sabre rattling with the U.S.
