By late 1942 most countries were investigating how to ramp up production of fighter jets. Several thousand jet fighter planes were made before the end of the war.
For most people, yes. But jet plane became public knowledge 82 years ago and had been flown a year earlier by the Germans at that point.
I'm going to seem like a typical American ignoramus here, but I was not aware until now that the Luftwaffe was still rocking the iron cross on their planes.
Well from my very limited googling, I have found that the first “fighter jet” was constructed and built in Germany 1941, so it’s plausible some would know of it.
überbleibsel von vor den Reformen... ich erinnere mich aich noch an geleakte Berichte der Bundeswehr in denen beschrieben wird, dass genug Luft-Luftraketen für den Kampfeinsatz eines Eurofighters zur Verfügung stehen..
