I think the line is if something is true or not. It's fine to blast someone for truths but this headline and article doesn't seem very legit. SVR General like a propaganda channel.
previously did a factcheck on Putin's illnesses SVR Telegram reported on and found out that there is no evidence of their claims of being run by former Russian inteligance officers.
While there are likely insiders who may be speaking to trusted sources (ie not this news outlet), it’s more likely that this is a story generated by people looking to make Putin look weak and raise further doubts about his health. It’s the same tactic as the other humiliating stories that have been put out about various leaders, like U.S. President Joe Biden supposedly losing his bowels at the Vatican (for context: Biden angers many staunch Catholics by taking communion when he’s pro-choice, so the choice of the Vatican as the site of him supposedly soiling himself isn’t surprising). Then there are all the stories of North Korea’s Kim Jong-un’s dietary excess, and rumors every few years that he’s on life support or even dead from gluttony-induced health issues.
If any of you remember the rumors a few years back about Kim Jong Un's health, the rumors of his ill health was likely used as a way to figure out who was and wasn't loyal. Regardless of the accuracy of the rumors it's the potential inner power struggle that reveals who is loyal and isn't if the rumors are credible within the inner circle.
