As a late forties immigrant from a former fascist country I try to vote social democrat and against the budding fascism, I just need more people to vote with me. I only vote democrat because there are very few socialist to vote for.
And, for the record...yes, I do what I can to get everyone around me to vote. I've donated time, and money to the cause. I imagine is much more than you'll ever do, besides trying to insult people for caring.
Younger voters complain...constantly about the older crowd being in politics....but the old people vote.
Also, remember the majority of younger voters refuse to vote. They understand politics like the boomers understand tech...but the boomers at least get something for their ignorance....re-elected.
Boomers show up, and vote for their ideologies, and people their age. Change needs to come from the younger generation. it doesn't happen magically. Only 27% of voters 18-29 showed up. That's 73% that didn't. If you want to point fingers, start with the 18-29 year olds that refuse to vote. The younger voters could push these dinosaurs out of office. They don't. twitter burns, and complaining aren't action.
