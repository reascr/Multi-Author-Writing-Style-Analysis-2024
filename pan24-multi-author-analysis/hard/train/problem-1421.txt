Folks have it so good but refuse to acknowledge it and turn their boredom and comfort into false beliefs and claims. It’s nature I guess. People NEED an enemy by which to judge themselves and feel either oppressed or superior.
The “thriving” image is just that, an image. The high school student parking lot is strewn with new/nearly new high end vehicles. These folks make a good living…but not that good! So O. Razor tells me that they are in debt past their heads. Credit isn’t real money right?
A smart friend told me that it’s just an illusion that there are two parties. Yes, corporate lobbyists truly influence legislation for both sides, but for the last few years only the Democrats are interested in real governing.
It's corporate greed, and as long as Lobbying is legal it's gonna remain that way because the Senate and the House can be bought with donations.
Trump meanwhile was fuming because the state and mainly the city would not allow anyone to stop the riot. Even the police simply fled.
