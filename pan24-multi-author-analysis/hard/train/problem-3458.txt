The potential upside to Boebert and Marj staying in the House is it reminds voters that MAGA is still very much a part of the GOP.
On the district level MAGA still has appeal in certain areas but nationally itâ€™s disastrous for the Republican Party.
McCarthy or whoever becomes the next house majority leader will have to spend so much attention to prevent MAGA from fracturing the party going into 2024. Hopefully to no avail.
Yeah I find both results hopeful. Would love to flip the district, of course, but the fact that it's in play at all is AMAZING. Mail in is the primary voting method in Colorado so I doubt it would favor dems in any significant way, but you never know.
Someone said in another thread that the remaining votes are mail in ballots, which typically favor dems. But I'm not sure if that is accurate or if there are enough to overcome a thousand vote deficit. There will still probably be a recount though. Even if she wins the writing is on the wall and in a presidential election year she will get kicked to the curb.
