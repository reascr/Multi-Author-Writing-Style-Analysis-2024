Better yet, they can accelerate aging as well, so if you go broke and don't pay your cell rebooting subscription, Then you get on the fast track to the grave.
There are so many potential problems (and a few benefits I suppose) if we find a way to stop aging or massively extend our life spans, especially if it's en masse and easily affordable.
See, I don’t really want to live longer (just the population problem alone puts me off that), but being healthier up until the end would be great. Like if I could be basically an 80 year old with the general health of a 45 year old and then kick the bucket? I’m down.
I dunno, and I’m not saying anyone should agree with me, but I’m fine with shorter life. This isn’t something that I recently started feeling. My mom sent me to therapy when I was 10 for saying this sort of thing and that was 35 years ago. I don’t think it’s sad and I’m not a depressed person. The fact that it’s a limited run makes me appreciate it all the more. If I hadn’t had a child I might already have checked out, but I would never do that to her.
I agree, but I don’t think it is realistic to expect a significant enough change in resource utilization to meet the needs. I’d love to be proven wrong, but I would imagine a messier/mass die-off situation is more likely than the world coming together.
