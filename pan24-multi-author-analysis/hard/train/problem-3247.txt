It's disturbing how often we are seeing these things happen. Using lies and fraud to get elected and then using the fact you are in the position you were elected to to cover up the lies and fraud.
This is what our politics have been reduced to, when open obvious frauds get elected, and then get extra time to come up with lies. I'm sure the elephants will circle the wagon around this liar and charlatan, because he's on their team. Sickening.
Someone check to see if he's wearing a mask because he's sounds more like scooby doo villain, actually their villains are more plausible.
And the cherry on top of this disgusting lack of sundae? The GOP will do nothing about him, because Mccarthy needs his vote. What a joke.
No real press coverage, means no scrutiny. The only ones with the ability to fact check is the news media and reporters, without having anyone to report that things don't add up, you get people like Santos. This is what the death of independent local news gets you. A few years ago, reporters would have cut their teeth cracking Santos like a rotten egg. Now he's a footnote, Trump takes all the air time, and so small but important stories get left behind.
