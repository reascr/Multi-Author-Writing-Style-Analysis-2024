I mean NORADs whole purpose is to detect and eliminate intercontinental ballistic missiles, which can launch in mascow and land in the U.S. within like 18 minutes or something so I'm a bit suspicious they didn't detect a slow moving balloon.
In 1946 China sent thousand of balloons way up into the sky to be carried to north America in the jet stream. They had timers and sand bags and every few hours would drop a sandbag to maintain altitude then when it was out of sandbags the last thing to drop were bombs. Every single one got blown way off course and ended up in the middle of no where mostly in northern Canada but one landed in the woods in Oregon.
A Sunday school took a bunch of kids on a field trip to the woods 5 kids found the balloon and called their 26 year old pregnant teacher to come see. It blew up and killed all six of them, the only fatalities from the thousands of balloons they sent over.
Imagine if the balloon would have popped on its own by accident over the USA and caused damage(or took lives). Now that would have been a astronomical cluster Fuck.
