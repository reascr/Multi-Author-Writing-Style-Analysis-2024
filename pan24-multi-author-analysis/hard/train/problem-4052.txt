And Russia invaded anyway. Absolute scum of the earth. They will die, rot, and fade into the lost abyss of history. And it’s all on Putin’s hands.
You neglected to mention the most important aspect of that memorandum: UKRAINE GAVE UP THEIR NUKES IN RETURN FOR A PEACE GUARANTEE FROM RUSSIA.
Ukraine already negotiated peace and safety by giving up nuclear weapons. Russia is a terrorist state, how can you expect any diplomacy and word-keeping? Any negotiations will be used against Ukraine.
What should Ukraine negotiate? Give up their one citizen to live under Russian occupation after we have seen how Russia treats the people there? In what reality is there a negotiation?
How does anyone reasonably see civil negotiations going? Russia already knows it was wrong and should just leave Ukraine alone. Russia committed horrific war crimes and wants to annihilate all Ukrainians. How would you reasonably negotiate with that?
Saying you want the war to end is not the same as stating that the two countries should negotiate peace. How? Russia will not allow for peace. They want conflict and destruction.
The longer the world turns their back and waits for this war to end, the more empowered Russia becomes. The strategy for ending this war and preventing future conflict is to assist Ukraine to have a quick victory and to show Russia that their actions will not be tolerated.
