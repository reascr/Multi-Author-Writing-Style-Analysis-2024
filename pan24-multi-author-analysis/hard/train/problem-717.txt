There’s also a misconception imo about how age of software matters, some of the most stabile business models are run using software written or purchased in the 90’s and that shit works great. All the kinks have been worked out, adding functionality is impossible, but really that means there’s less shit go wrong when the software is simple.
I know this is against the rhetoric, but as someone who flies frequently (30 times in 2022) southwest is the best domestic carrier imo, they give away a lot of perks that you have to pay at other airlines and it doesn’t feel like a cheap experience. Maybe that’s just because my primary airport is a southwest hub, but that’s just my 2 cents.
An airline ticket is a fee for a service-transport to another place. The passenger arrived at the correct time for the service to be rendered only for the service to be cancelled with little or no warning, and it’s not like the airline even still incurs the cost of fuel and whatnot. How could there be any other outcome than a full and complete refund?
I have not made the call to refund yet but we’re you able to get anything more? I was not stranded anywhere but instead drove to the destination instead using my own vehicle.
