I find it funny how many (online) people continue to “oh this generation” when they see people. No, it isn’t this generation. They always existed and were forced to conform to their current society by threat of exile or death. Their idea of a good society is the punishment of these people existing. Sickening.
Yes but most of the democrats in senate and house were not there at the time of DOMA. This is was progress is called. And don’t equivocate that to modern Republican denial of the exact same thing. It’s pretty much the same as “DEMS WERE THE PARTY OF SLAVERY!” When that happened 6 generations ago.
I mentioned nothing of slavery, and you didn't use "equivocate" correctly. (And DOMA wasn't six generations ago. I was there in DC when it was passed.) Forgive me if I'm not impressed with your condescending attitude about what constitutes progress. Democratic partisans and centrists should really take a moment to learn history and/or humility.
Okay, yes the Democrats made the right choice now, but what posts like this ignore is that the Democrats supported and a Democrat signed the defense of marriage act, the law this new one is repealing. It's great that Democrats have finally come around, but don't hurt yourself patting yourself on the back.
