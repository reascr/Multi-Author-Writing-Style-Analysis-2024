Again, I have to disagree. Yes tickets are more expensive, but having been to many many concerts over the years I don't see much of a difference in show enthusiasm. Just depends on the fan base.
And I agree to an extent, especially with point A, sports tickets have become unreachable for many people. However I don't know if go as far as to say people are "torching their financial position" for concert tickets.
Just auction off the tickets and let people decide how much they’re willing to spend on some concert or whatever.
What if you just want to sell tickets for a profitable yet affordable price and ensure anyone of your fans has the chance to buy them?
I would take it a step farther and suggest that tickets bought online have to have name printed on them that matches the card holder/person that is attending.
Because scalpers would still swoop in and buy them all up in order to extort as much money as they can from fans.
I’m suggesting a way to make it so normal people can go see a show and don’t have to compete against a computer.
If the problem is people buying up tickets with bots so normal people can’t attend, then jacking up the price and reselling them on ticketmasters resale platform, then it seems entirely reasonable to point at resales and stop it.
