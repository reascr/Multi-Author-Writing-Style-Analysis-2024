So dem politicians who beliefs are normally anti God running things now makes sense. So as they continue to run things into the ground, it’s all according to what bible says will happen anyway. So 👍🏾.
Just like natzi can not peacefully coexist with jew because a natzi view of morality is vastly different. To a natzi, just being a Jew is offensive to them. And thus they pushed their view of morality with policy changes.
Not saying dems are natzi, just saying dems just like natzi push their view of morality through policy changes. Republicans do not. (If say abortion ban is immoral, I ask, since when is it immoral to save the life of a child?).
Yep. McCain is well liked here even after his passing. If McCain was still alive I bet his endorsement would be better than Trumps for local Republicans.
i feel like calling them "mccain republicans" is not quite right. mccain would talk sense and say he was going to vote blue, and then vote red anyway. these people actually followed through, unlike mccain.
