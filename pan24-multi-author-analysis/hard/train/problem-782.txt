That's so awful. The number of lives lost, and lives ruined. And for what? Some old man's obsession. All those able-bodied young people with their whole lives ahead of them, just being slaughtered. On both sides. And yes, I know Russia is the aggressor but I can still feel sorrow for this absolute disregard for human life and all of the sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers, and fathers being killed in pursuit of such a stupid and tragic goal.
Russia WILL lose, it's just a question of how many more innocent Ukrainians will have to be killed by Russia, before the West steps up to its moral duty to provide the weapons Ukraine needs to end this war ASAP.
Add in the colossal waste in lives and equipment, and it is simply unsustainable for Russia. They're breaking on the rock of Ukraine.
Tbf, it would be about full speed for the average snail, 24 hours a day - but I think if you're getting into the weeds of "exactly how fast a snail goes, compared to our pathetic military", the problem is still clear...
Once Western equipment like tanks arrive for the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Russian positions all along the front will be moving backwards a lot faster than 3km a month...!
