The ACA hasn't solved our healthcare problems, but I will always be thankful that John McCain voted against his party to preserve it.
No, the position of the Democratic Party is to maintain the status quo and retain the ACA rather than some form of universal healthcare that would improve things vastly. Most people on this thread also want to toe the political line too.
Person 2: No ACA must stay, it’s the ONLY way, and besides Bernie isn’t even a democrat, why should we listen to him???
What, what? She's never run against Bill Clinton since she was married to him, and she against Obama unless you count votes for contests that neither candidate was allowed to campaign in because of DNC rules. Obama's name wasn't even on the ballot in Michigan in 2008. Regardless, she never went up against any of the three in a general election.
In 2016 I still felt very confident that she would win (as most Democrats did), but, again, in hindsight there were very visible flaws there that we all ignored because of how much of a villain Trump was.
He’s a big factor trump won in 2016, yeah, but to be fair it’s more of the fact that his supporters just couldn’t fucking except that he lost the primary.
