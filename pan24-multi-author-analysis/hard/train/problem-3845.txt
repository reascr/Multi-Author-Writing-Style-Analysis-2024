Establishment Democrats are really lucky they have such nationally popular policies, because WOW they are bad at this sometimes.
It is objective reality that both parties, but the Democrats most visibly, have given up on rural America. That the urban population outnumbers the rural population lets you call this a winning strategy, and that's fine from a game theory perspective, but it should be no surprise that resentment is sky high in these areas. It's no great mystery, they are bleeding jobs, money, and population to the cities. Just look at the county maps from 2000 vs today.
I have a surplus of good will for the democrats given what the last 5 years have been, but the gap between their talking points and their actual legislation remains significant. Rural Americans are one of the poorest cohorts in the country and yet they vote hard right. The working class party has not improved their lives one iota in 20 years. Neither have the Republicans, but the Republicans at least gleefully extend them the evil elite bone, and that's the only bone they have. They chew on it viciously.
