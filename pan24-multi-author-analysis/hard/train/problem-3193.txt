And while all of this is happening, I hope they remember - there is only one way for them to get the sanctions lifted, and it isn’t even very difficult:
Sanctions are not there as some arbitrary punishment out of hatred for Russia or Russian people; they exist to incentivise a change in policy. Stop the war and the sanctions can be lifted.
Some sanctions will drop. The sanctions on chips that could possibly used in military applications is likely around to stay. Economic sanctions until Russia pays reparations (or their foreign holdings confiscated for it). Etc.
Yep. It also makes the lower level Russian commanders look better because “missing soldiers” aren’t classified as “dead soldiers.” Farther up the chain the Russian high command probably know this is bullshit but the upper level commanders don’t want to post high KIA numbers either, the “news” is searching for anyway to spin the war in a positive light so they don’t want accurate KIA numbers either and the Russian government would rather not make the payments to the families of the dead soldiers. Basically everyone who could press for the truth has a vested interest in keeping the lie going.
And many that weren't drafted fled the country or are either too old or too young to be in the market for significant numbers of cars. Of those that are left many are specifically cutting back on major purchases and spending due to the economic uncertainty. If you think you may lose your job in the next 100 days you're probably not about to buy a car unless it's absolutely necessary.
And Russia's massive oil and gas production has also resulted in the country having a frightening case of Dutch disease. The major businesses are run like a mafia and everyone has to have links to Putin to operate. As a result Russia doesn't have the means to support its government based on tax revenue so if the energy exports dry up they are in serious long term trouble.
