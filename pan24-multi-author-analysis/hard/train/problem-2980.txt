This issue is a non issue as far as I’m concerned. Many young people, particularly young teens and older teens that are gay already feel stigmatized and this is another measure to single them out. It hasn’t been a big deal to any young person I know and just hampers teachers and students about what they can and do say. No one is pushing any young person (elementary to middle to high school) to be gay, it is a time to discuss (and they do among themselves) their sexuality.
Why do you think homophobes and transphobes are so mortally terrified of their kids having gay teachers and openly nonbinary classmates? Because they know damn well that as soon as their kids start meeting and interacting with queer people in real life, everything they've been taught about queer people at home and in church will be exposed for the bigoted bullshit that it is.
These laws are all just the kicking and screaming of people who privately know they've already lost. Support for LGBTQ rights, acceptance, and visibility has been growing consistently over the past couple decades, and there's no reason to believe that that's going to change.
