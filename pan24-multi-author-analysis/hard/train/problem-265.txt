I asked you if you think the strike only affects the oligarchs, not who benefits the most ?Before you ask me a question, try answering what you're asked first.
Letting a massive strike cripple the economy would make the corporations hurt, and would make the rest of us hurt too. We shouldn't let labor take a hammer to the knee of the economy.
That’s not to say that these workers don’t deserve sick time or that there’s no argument to support the labor unions here, of course. I just think it’s worthwhile to not reduce such a nuanced and complex issue into overly simplified buckets of good and evil.
Eh. This is not an issue that’s as black and white as it’s being presented to be. There’s an obvious “rail bosses vs. rank-and-file” angle here, to be sure, but there’s also a lot more to it than that.
There’s a pretty good argument to be made, for example, that allowing commercial rail service to be suspended right before Christmas, the busiest time of shipping services and long-distance travel, is not “serving his country,” too. A lot of critical material is transited via rail in this country, much more than is obvious, and the consequences of a strike like this could add pressure to an already stressed economy.
