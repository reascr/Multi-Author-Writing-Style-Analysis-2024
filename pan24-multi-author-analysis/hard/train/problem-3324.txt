Thatâ€™s a great question tbh. I would imagine climate plays a factor. Culture maybe too to some extent. Also access to education and economical prosperity. Really I have no idea lol.
No, you have no idea what you are talking about. Most Chinese have been vaccinated for 3 times. In China, they developed multiple apps to track people's datas. You would be forbidden entry to many places like stores, bakery, malls, workplaces, if your QR code showed you were not qualified. Before they loosened the covid policy, people literally needed to line up and do a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test every two days in order to be able to work. In some places, they needed to do a test every single day.
Do correct me if I'm wrong, because it seems that you clearly have lived in China at least for a while. I thought vaccination would affect QR codes, because it shows right under the code that if you have been vaccinated or not. And I have yet to meet someone who has not been vaccinated. Hence my conclusion. Unlike the Americans who sometimes have this rebel spirit and choose to not get vaccinated, the Chinese are often very submissive, to be vaccinated or not, that is not a matter of choice. Anyway, if you know any person who's not vaccinated but is free to go to any place, please feel free to share the story with me.
But I live in China and I have seen how many people were lining up for the vaccine and for how long the vaccine campaign went on. Sure, I don't really talk to the elderly, but I don't know anyone who didn't get vaccinated. Based on personal observations, I see no reason to doubt that number.
The problem is that the existing vaccines are no good against the current variants. Also not that different from the West.
The difference is that the Chinese population didn't build up natural immunity by being exposed to the virus, as happened in the West.
