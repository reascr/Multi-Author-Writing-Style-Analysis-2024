I liked when he blamed the west for the rise of the nazis as a military power despite the fact that Nazi Germany and the USSR had a deal to invade and divide Eastern Europe and the USSR hosted 4 secret bases to train the German army and German pilots between 1922 and 1933.
Not only have they forgotten Stalin sided with Hitler but apparently the allies lend lease and military support never happened and they fought off the whole of the "collective West" on their own. What a load of bullshit.
It's just alot of logic fallacies by really stupid people. False equivalence plays a large role. Where some people on the right will see Biden in Kyiv and decide "well maybe the other side has a point too?!?" That degrades fairly rapidly into bringing up their talking points as counter-arguments to a fight that doesn't need to happen.
Hitler's rise to power didn't just happen in 1933 when he was appointed Chancellor. For the better part of the decade before that he had maneuvered on different levels and in different states. He had popular support in the army and with some of the larger manufacturers. It's not like the Nazi's just showed up in 1933.
