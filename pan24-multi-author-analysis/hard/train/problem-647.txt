And Corporations (aka their managers and shareholders) will FIGHT sanctions, laws, taxes designed to obstruct their making profit-driven decisions that are evil. So that means we-the-people must insist our elected representatives fight back and make them happen.
Corporations are amoral, profit-seeking mechanisms. No corporation would pull out of Russia as long as its shareholders could see returns for doing business there.
This is why Corporations must be forced to 'do the right thing' by making it a losing proposition for their shareholders to continue doing business in Russia. Therefore, sanctions.
At the end of the day, are the sanctions necessary? Yes, Putin is a ass and deserved to be tried at Hague. But claiming companies only are greedy is a bit misleading.
Some companies get so big that the people who are in charge can pretend morals don’t matter anymore - like it’s a machine that runs on its own.
They shouldn't care, we shouldn't base our direction (social/ political) on hoping that some giant corporation will be nice on given day.
