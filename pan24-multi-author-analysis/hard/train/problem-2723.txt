Nothing just want the negativity ✌️!… Cops and teachers have the worst pay and endless stress now. I want fair pay so the rest of my life I’ll be placing post notes in stores saying equal pay so they could waste more money and time cleaning.
Its only happening because everyone needs more money so mr. fuck up (President Biden) please release more money so we could seem like we gotten anything for another 2months 🥱.
Then do me a favor leave the 🇺🇸 if you’re here. don’t try to push into what’s not good Take your communist/socialist wants and just move to NK… Cops and all those first aid responders including teachers because that’s what they are have always deserved higher pay since 90s. Just like you disarming our military go fly a kite over there in NK and see how well you do with it.. I won’t stand for cops not getting better pay and equipment.
No, not all police are bastards. In fact, the vast majority are hard working, good people, who perform a wonderful and necessary service.
Yeah crime has been increasing, and the number of deaths is a tiny fraction of total police interactions. Also (and unfortunately) since we in the US insist on having a lot of guns around, we will always have more deaths on all sides (people shooting others, but also police escalating more quickly than if guns weren't as large an issue).
