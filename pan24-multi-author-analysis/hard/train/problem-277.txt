For a whole new system like this they don't want to give it punishments while they figure out the kinks that wouldn't be the citizens fault for not following through... They could always add punishment down the road when they've become confident in their process.
But they can compel participation in the civics of this country(see jury duty). Additionally if i am remembering this correctly Australia doesn't force you to vote for a candidate more that you must cast a ballot as there is an option for none of the above.
Your comment wasn’t really about people who couldn’t be arsed to vote (as opposed to not voting as an act of protest), so I wasn’t addressing that segment of voters.
Are you commenting to me because you would prefer that people who want to refrain from voting as an act of protest state their intention not to vote rather than submit a blank ballot? Are you opposed to compulsory voting for that reason?
Your comment specifically referenced not voting as a form of protest. Having your refusal to vote counted is a better protest than not having it. Protest efforts typically require more effort than doing nothing.
