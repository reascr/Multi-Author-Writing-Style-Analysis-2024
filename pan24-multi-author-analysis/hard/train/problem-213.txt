Bibi and the Israeli right are much more concerned with Iran and local military threats, and they perceive the American Republican party as hawkish along the same lines, so he will tolerate any antisemitism from the GOP as long as Christian conservatives continue to believe Israel must be protected from Muslims and want to continue pouring in military and economic support.
Ultimately they view anyone who is not Jewish as potentially antisemitic for any number of reasons. For him it's about nurturing alliances against common enemies so everyone doesn't turn on Israel at once.
There is so much overt antisemitism all around the world that Trump and whatever is going on with American right wing conspiracists is nothing new or shocking to him. The American evangelicals still want to protect Israel and they view the Jewish government as an ally in the modern Crusades, even though they are fundamentally antisemitic, so Bibi will nurture that relationship as long as he can.
The only reason fundamentalist evangelical Christianâ€™s say they care about Israel is because they believe that Israel has to exist for Jesus to return.
