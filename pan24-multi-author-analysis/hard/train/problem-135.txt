That sub is for those with a different mindset, different from ours and many others, there are many different groups of minds everywhere, I had to learn this through me being very ignorant and dumbfounded about them lol.
I’m American born and raised. To be specific, Asian American. To be even more specific, Vietnamese ethnicity. But as American as it gets. I was raised by parents who fled Vietnam after the war, as like tens of millions of others had. They didn’t flee anything scandalous, no. They fled communism. You can imagine how I was raised, as to what ethics and you can probably imagine how I feel about socialism.
They’re banking on a dream that doesn’t work, has proven to not work, but they’re banking on the theory alone. It was ignorant of me to come all up in there to think I could debate them. Just as you did over on that sub.
That's par for the course, far beyond that subreddit. Here in Georgia everyone I know (in a very conservative county) was righteous about some old story about Rafael Warnock running over his wife's foot, but was very dismissive of the far more egregious abuse stories about Hershel Walker.
