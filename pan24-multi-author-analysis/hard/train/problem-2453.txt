An actual blockade would imply China stopping and potentially seizing neutral shipping, including American shipping. The right of American merchants to go anywhere and sell anything around the world has always been policy and casus belli for the Americans. During WWI, America's eventual declaration of war on Germany was directly caused by German Unrestricted Submarine Warfare which killed Americans and impacted American sale of both war contraband and regular goods across the Atlantic. Moreover, at the beginning of the Cold War, the American-led Berlin Air Lift was a strong response to Soviet attempts at blockading West Berlin, as well as a potent demonstration of Allied logistics capability. So the case of a blockade on Taiwan, the United States would have all the moral and historical justification to call China's bluff by sending supplies to Taiwan, forcing China into an uncomfortable position, where they must take the loss, or fire on American ships and risk bringing America into the war.
China is also not immune from a blockade itself, and any belligerent would likely seize on China's dependency on oil imports from the Gulf and its food imports from everywhere as a way to retaliate in kind. In this, America possesses the ability to shutdown maritime trade in the Straits of Malacca, Hormuz, Suez and Panama, depriving China of its oil and food imports. There is also a risk of escalation as Taiwan, Korea and Japan view sea trade as a matter of existential threat.
Sure but ultimately it comes down to whether or not China plans to invade Taiwan and plans to take full control of the South China Sea. China's support for Russia also doesn't help.
China is aligned with Russia. They literally made an anti-west pact with 'friendships with no limits' while Russia had 150k troops ready to invade Ukraine in Feb.
The prevention is the failure of the Russians in Ukraine along with the solidarity of NATO and other Western aligned states towards Ukraine.
