Right, but at present nothing is replacing it. Twitter being blown up blows up the network itself. People aren't leaving to something better; they're leaving because they can't stay. And until that new network appears, a bunch of artists are going to have a hole in their business.
It's just bizarre to watch, and I'm not sure I know of anything like it happening before. Doesn't that make it newsworthy?
It’s normal to comment that you don’t think certain topics are newsworthy. If a news outlet started reporting on what the teletubbies had for breakfast everyday you’d say “I don’t care what the teletubbies had for breakfast”.
I don't care about the Teletubbies except to mock Christians, but if I heard they were having breakfast I'd still say "gimme some of them Teletubbies vittles!".
Yeah. Probably why I never got into Twitter. I just found my feed always a constant mess and it took more time to skip over nonsense and find anything remotely interesting to read. I also didn’t care about what any celebrity had to say. So I guess Twitter was never for me.
