Yes, but more in the case of when an Indian child needs foster care, not necessarily that they're just snatching children. And the crux of the issue is whether these children in need of foster care should be kept in their communities/culture or fostered with non-native families. And I'm sure these christian groups logic for opposing that is they'd rather these kids go to Christian families so they can show them the light and make them Christian. Just a continuation of the cultural genocide of the native Americans.
Genocide is far more common than even the genocide of the indigenous Americans & Australian-Oceanian aboriginals would suggest.
The first Homo Sapiens of England like “Cheddar Man” had Black hair & skin yet Blue eyes which is awesome.
Christianity and Islam (Mohammed’s Caliphate was based on conquest & death and forced conversion). Both religions were complicit in mass genocide & enslavement. Farmers usually committed genocide or enslaved hunter-gatherers post-Holocene, like the Bantu peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa for example. The Roman Empire regularly practiced genocide.
