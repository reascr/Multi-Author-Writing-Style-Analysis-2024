"I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered at the White House - with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.”.
The GOP has become the most revolting collection of bigots, authoritarians, scammers, money launderers, duplicitous fanatics, perverts, opportunists, and half-wits gathered at the White House--with the possible exception of when Donald Trump tweeted from the shitter during 'executive time'.".
That said. You need to actually fulfill your part of the transaction to actually have relationships that are worth keeping too.
I have the same philosophy — all your relationships (except possibly your kids) should be transactional. If you’re getting nothing out of any relationship (friend, business, partner) it’s time to leave or try to fix it—you’ll be happier for it. What you get out of a relationship might be something intangible — but you should get something.
Love, affection, respect,a sense of satisfaction are all intangibles that count, amongst other things.
I agree with them - all relationships should be transactional in some sense but I think their description doesn't do a great job of explaining the intangible parts.
