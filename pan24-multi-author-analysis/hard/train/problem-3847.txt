The gun is so, so much cheaper with the cost being a few bullets instead of the whole drone. I think that's inevitable. We are now at the point where the first pilots dropped grenades and bricks at people in trenches and moving towards real "fighter planes" drones quickly.
Ironically these drones are so shitty that the lasers are less effective against them than they would be against more advanced ones.
What, reconditioning some stored weapons systems that are 50+ years old or using said systems against slow, low flying drones.
Iranian UAVs are so low tech though, they likely could simply be jammed via something like the DRAKE system, which is literally just a backpack kit. Jam all the communication channels, and render the UAV useless. That would be adequate I assume. It's what the US Navy has been using for the past several years to jam drones operating off Chinese "fishing ships" that have been harassing them.
The issue for Ukraine is they're high priced (initial purchase price), and more importantly, they're brand new state of the art. US isn't going to risk sending one to Ukraine where Russia could potentially capture it.
