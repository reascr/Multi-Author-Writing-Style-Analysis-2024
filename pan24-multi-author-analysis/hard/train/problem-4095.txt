Trump sucked in some ways, but he actually did some good. He secured the southern border (for the first time in modern history), facilitated peace treaties in the ME, and helped a stumbling economy start growing at a good pace. Lowest unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics (and women), as well (I provide this for the identity politics crowd, who are probably unaware of this fact).
Of course they are different. Trump had the power to declassify any document he wanted, Biden did not (at the time of taking them home).
Biden was not entitled to have any classified documents from his vice presidential office, as far as I know.
Biden seemed to have carelessly kept a few classified documents in a couple different locations. Here is where is gets shady, this was kept quiet for 2 months during an election and from what I have seen Biden's own lawyers were allowed to do the searching, people as far as I know do not have security clearance. Now this may be innocent but I find it highly suspect that the DOJ or somebody didn't send a team in to conduct the search at least in some capacity be directly involved in it. It looks as if the DOJ did a solid to Biden allowing them to do the search because if the DOJ went in it would have gotten out. This doesn't look at the very least.
