What? You didn't actually explain why it should be a harsher sentence for someone to harm a police officer. You just said "it's attack on an individual and wider society." Harming anyone at all is "attack of an individual and wider society" since we're all individuals and we're all, in some sense, part of society. Is a teacher or a convenience store employee any less representative of "wider society" than a cop??
If everyone has a duty to help each other and all, why is it that harming someone who happens to be paid to do that should carry higher consequences?
If you attack or harm an officer you can expect a longer sentence, which makes sense because it's attack on an individual and wider society. The reverse should also be true though, the abuse of position to inflict harm should be harsher.
In the UK policing is by consent. This means that everyone has a duty of care to prevent and stop crimes or disorder.
Should have been clearer it is already is a harsher sentence if you attack a police officer (or emergency worker as they are covered under the same law). It would be whilst acting as part of their job not just because of their job (or who employs them).
