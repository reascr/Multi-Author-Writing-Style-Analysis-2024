All he did was knowingly carry water for a man who literally incited a mob of traitors to murder _them_. By them I mean congress.
Speaker of the House does not need to be held by a House member. Theoretically, they could push for Cheney (who did not win her primary) to be Speaker and that would be fine. There were also Republican plans (or whispers of plans) to elect Trump as Speaker that were floated earlier this year if they re-took the House.
Is it possible that a contingent of House Republicans refuse to vote for whoever the GOP Speaker candidate is and Democrats could push through one of their own?
Iâ€™m saying if there are even like 3 or 4 republicans who decide to not cast a vote for whoever the compromise GOP speaker candidate is, Dems could just vote in a minority Speaker.
What would be more likely is that the Democrats push for a more moderate Speaker and try to peel off a few Republican votes with that.
And he was just re-elected. Would be pretty shitty of him to flip parties right after being elected.
Knew it was going to be him. He was the only Democrat in the House to vote against abortion rights. He's by far the most conservative Democrat in the House.
