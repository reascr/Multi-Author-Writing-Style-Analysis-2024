Trump couldn't file a 1040EZ at this point in his life. He isn't a clever businessman. I'm glad his taxes are out there as it fulfills a campaign promise but I doubt there's much in there besides the usual exploitation of tax loopholes by the rich courtesy of the people that actually do his taxes.
Iâ€™m not sure of that either, but people generally seemed to think (or maybe that was just the promoted narrative) that there was some tax fraud, which didnâ€™t make sense since the IRS would have been all over his returns like white on rice.
If the IRS itself didnâ€™t have any problems with his tax returns, I am not sure why there was such a push to have them publicly released. ðŸ¤” The IRS isnâ€™t known for being particularly lenient in the face of any wrongdoing.
didn't a few of his accountants already plead guilty to submitting fraudulent tax returns or something?
The problem is that you cannot mislead investors or insurance companies about the value of your assets in relation to what you tell the IRS. If you tell the IRS its worth $10, and you tell your insurance company its worth $100, you have technically lied to both. whats worse, if you lied to banks or investors about those assets as well, you have done worse because you pissed of really rich people.
That said, to be clear, what he is doing isn't "illegal", it might be perfectly legal. from a business standpoint, if you show low business income or a loss, you get paid back by a lot from the government, so it is a smart business strategy if you aren't a publicly traded business.
