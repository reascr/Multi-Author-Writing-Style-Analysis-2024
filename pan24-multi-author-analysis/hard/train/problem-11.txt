And then what? Pilots quit, and/or wildcat strike anyway, and the airlines do what? Make the C-suite execs try and fly the planes? You can't effectively scab the entirety of high-skill and high-experience jobs like "large passenger plane pilot.".
Yeah. When I worked in Holland for a while, I was floored with how much EU residents get. Even the lowly service and retail workers. I sent some guy home one day because he was being an ass, and my boss asked why. I told him, and he said, "No, don't do that, he still gets paid, even if he's not here." Top that with sick pay and vacation pay, and somehow, things still run fine and I guess it's profitable since companies stay in business.
I used to play Microsoft Flight Simulator back in the 80's. I could never figure it out, but I imagine a real plane is easier since it's not all vector graphics.
I imagine one day planes will fly themselves since it seems like a self-flying plane would be a lot easier to program than a self-driving car but until that day, two pilots.
Awhile back, I read a proposal to have pilots fly the planes remotely from the ground so that each pilot could fly multiple planes at the same time. That sounds like a way to completely suck the fun out of the job and destroy one of the reasons people probably want to be pilots in the first place.
Removing a pilot from the flight deck undermines that entire effort and will absolutely decrease safety purely for the sake of increasing profits (people that think ticket prices will go down are nuts). Thankfully for everyone, the FAA don't get down like that. Their primary purpose for existing is to keep aviation safe; and despite what the news networks say, they are very good at it.
That accident directly led to legislation in Europe requiring 2 people on the flight deck at all times. When a pilot needs to use the lav, a flight attendant comes onto the flight deck in the meantime.
