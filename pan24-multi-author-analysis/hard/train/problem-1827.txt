the position of the saudi government is that they will agree to normalize relations with Israel if it makes a deal with the Palestinians on the two-state solution.
That's why some Israelis claim that Palestinians already have a state, and that the 'two state solution' is really 3 state solution - two Palestinian states with zero Jews and one Jewish state with a large Palestinian minority.
Well, since they still officially do not recognize Israel's right to exist and I would argue that a 1 state solution is just the end of Israel. So let's go with 2SS.
Since you do, please tell me, what should Israel do in order to "Give people more rights" but still protect it's own citizens against a population who launched tens of thousands of rockets on it, committed endless amounts of terror attacks including suicide bombers, explosive charges, random shootings, knife attacks and more?
The most practical and immediate thing I can think of is that the Palestinians must declare publicly and honestly that they recognize the right for Israel to exist and are letting go of ALL violence, and Israel in return is completely stopping and enforcing a no more expansions or new settlements in the West bank.
I guess I would contend that Israel left the Gaza strip because it was too costly for them to protect the few settlers that were actually there and Sharon could use it as a point of saying how moral he was (omitting how quickly military actions increased once Israeli citizens were out.).
Yes. Did you think those who think Palestinians have the right to live without rockets exploding over their heads or drones blowing up housing complexes would say "no"?
