I know the Baltic states have a lot to lose if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, but it is so goddamned heart warming to hear about the constant out pouring of support these guys have been giving to the Ukrainian people.
But to truly understand why Ukraine is still in need despite the out poring of support it is a fundamental problem of armed conflict in residential areas. It costs a lot to wage an invasion. Russia has oil money to pay for that. This was the purpose of the tariffs and the accounts being frozen. Unfortunately both China and India continue to need Russian oil and as such are funding the invasion. The complexity is that it costs even more to defend yourself. And the easiest way for an invading enemy to hurt another state is to disrupt its trade. Thus making it both need to spend money to defend itself and not having the tax base to support that spending.
Most often when a state gives aid the amount is spent on the giving states industry and the goods are then given to the recipient of the aid. This is done for a myriad of reasons. Most foremost the fact that often the state receiving aid is in crisis and may not have the resources or the capacity to produce the things they need.
Just as an aside; international aid does not directly get deposited into a country. The political framework of comparison between how sovereign states work and how individual households is both wrong and harmful.
