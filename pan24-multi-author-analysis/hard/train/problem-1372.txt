But we should shout at them until they’re forced to leave, we should deplatform them wherever possible.
Hate speech and free speech are actually fundamentally compatible, because the former will always try to be used to silence the latter. This is why “true free speech” is a myth - the regulation of hate speech is necessary to prevent the silencing of the vulnerable.
In order for something to actually be done, the definition of what is considered acceptable under free speech to be changed, and that would likely take years, and be met with extreme resistance.
On a side note, I'd like to point out to anyone who doesn't know, that the notion the shooter considered himself non-binary, has absolutely nothing to do with if this can be considered a hate crime.
- Appeals to hypocrisy when the left calls out the shooter for disengenuously using neo-pronouns at the last minute to make a mess of things and get out of being charged for a hate crime, despite mountains of evidence showing the shooter was using he/him pronouns even directly prior to this event.
