Using a nuclear weapon of any kind is a gaurantee of a NATO intervention, Ukraine being a member or not doesn't matter, the free world has had just about enough of this little celebration of genocide.
Simply put Russia isn't going to use nukes because there is literally no realistic scenario where they end up in a better situation (and why would you use a weapon that guarantees a loss). Russia keeps threatening nukes because they know people like you are going to panic about them and try and force those who know better to back down.
If I had to put money on who's rapid response nuclear deterrent deployment behaves as designed, it's not on Russia's. I would also bet it all on the fact that they don't get the opportunity to work out what went wrong with the missiles that don't detonate or hit their intended target.
It could in theory destroy the missile, but it's the wrong tool for that particular job. And even if it did knock the target out, that's a lot of kinetic energy still in the air.
A Kh-22 can hit Mach 4.5 iirc. LPWS (land phalanx weapon system) has an effective range of about a mile, which that missile can cover in just over one second (I'm guessing, no idea what final approach speed is). Also consider, in a case like this, the missile is likely not flying directly at the LPWS.
