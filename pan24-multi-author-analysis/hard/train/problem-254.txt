That word "political" doesn't even mean what it's supposed to mean anymore. It used to mean "having to do with the affairs of the state" in which case, to your point, it ought to be the reason to comply.
I don't know when this happened but for w/e reason that word now seems to mean "partisan". It shouldn't though.
IDK about that. I think that it has been shown in the past that, despite being partisan hacks, none of the justices trump appointed really give a shit about him. They didn't curry favor with him to get the job, they curried favor with the Federalist Society and other republicans.
I mean, obviously I know the supreme court ruling that tax records are personal property is hyperbole, but there is truth behind the sentiment. The supreme court can twist words and logic their way into helping trump if they want to and I was responding to that.
why ask the supreme court for permission when 3 of the judges on the court were appointed by trump himself thats a literal conflict of interest right there.
