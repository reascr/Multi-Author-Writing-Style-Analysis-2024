The US will absolutely not allow Kurdistan to be attacked by Iran under any circumstances. In any case, this would be disastrous to Iran, who would immediately be faced with Kurdish resistance like they’ve never seen before.
If Iran hostilely attacks Iraq, specifically Iraqi Kurdistan, I propose that the Iraqi’s and Kurd’s band together, to declare total Kurdish Independence from Iran.
If they do decide to invade Kurdish Iraq, it’ll probably lead to a larger armed uprising in the ethnic Kurdish areas of Iran, which could embolden other ethnic groups like in Baluchistan to follow suit. It will probably destabilize the Middle East even further because Iran could call it’s proxies to engage in conflict with the Kurdish opposition groups in Iraq and Syria.
If a war breaks out between the Kurds and Iran, we could see the start of a war between a bunch of countries that would not be in the best interest of anyone.
The Kurdish people want to form a country that would include the Northern quarter of Iran, Iraq and half of Eastern Turkey. For some reason, Iran, Iraq and Turkey are not excited about this prospect.
