Someone didn't read the article. Or the consistent public polling numbers for the last 30 years showing 70% of Americans support safe, legal access to abortion.
If you do your research you will see that 60% of America believes abortion should be legal in the first trimester and 83% when the mothers life is danger.
A logical national standard would be for insurance to cover legal abortion in the first trimester to ensure that those who desire them can promptly go to the doctor avoiding both health problems and the inherent complication of going beyond that point.

- Prohibits doctors from performing abortions after 15 weeks gestation – when an unborn child can feel pain – except in situations involving rape, incest, or risks to the life and physical health of the mother. (Affects New York, Oregon, California, Minnesota, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, Vermont, Hawaii - All Blue States).
The pro-choice people have never been about unlimited abortion. They have always been about doctors making the decision with the help of science and not politicians (or religious fundies).
