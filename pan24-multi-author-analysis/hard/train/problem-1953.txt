Boebert actually has the better argument here. McCarthy doesn't have the votes he needs. Hannity keeps telling her to withdraw because she doesn't have the votes, but that fundamentally doesn't make sense when their vote is against Kevin rather than pro-anyone else. There's nothing for them to withdraw and they don't need 218 votes.
Sure, but that's just traditionally. That doesn't mean they have to. Pelosi didn't get all the votes in her caucus either, but she had the power and leadership ability to create reasonable deals and get people to vote present instead of for someone else. McCarthy is in this position because he's a bad leader to his caucus. His caucus may be actually unmanageable, but that's what people voted for and that's what McCarthy enabled.
There’s a reason that even if McCarthy gives them everything and gets their vote he can’t win, because others may not be willing to destroy themselves so McCarthy can be speaker.
with concessions like these, even if McCarthy wins the speakership vote, he's going to be powerless lame duck beholden to the insurrection caucus from the first day.
Seems to me Democrats are missing a huge opportunity here…they could each take turns being nominated for speaker, and one-by-one each get more votes than McCarthy.
It wouldn’t just be for humiliation, but for an hour or two each nominee would have a spotlight on them to talk about what they would do for the country - which you wouldn’t get if it was just Jeffries every time.
