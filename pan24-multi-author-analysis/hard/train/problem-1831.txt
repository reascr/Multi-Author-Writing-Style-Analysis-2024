I think it is worded clearly because they mean any change of status in either direction; not just in the direction of China gaining more control over Taiwan, but likewise in the direction of formal declaration of Taiwanese independence. At present, pretty much everyone but China just wants to maintain the status quo, IE: de facto Taiwanese independence insofar as China has no control over Taiwan, but no formal declaration of independence because such a declaration would only serve to antagonize China and may well compel them to attack Taiwan.
If you’re wondering why America’s official policies aren’t more supportive of Taiwan’s democracy, it’s because the official policy was locked in place by treaty and by law (Taiwan Relations Act) back in the 1970s when Taiwan’s government wasn’t a democracy and wasn’t Taiwanese. It had very different goals than today’s Taiwanese government.
In practice American policy goes a bit further. America doesn’t want to be drawn into a war, so America pushes back against even peaceful efforts by Taiwan to officially change the status quo. Back in the early 2000s Taiwan’s leader was pushing to rewrite the constitution. America made it clear that doing so would cause problems in Taiwan’s relationship with America and Taiwan’s leader backed down. He pushed the envelope in other ways and became very disliked by the American government.
America very definitely opposes Taiwan making official changes to the status quo. It has a big impact because Taiwanese want American support.
The current leader, Tsai, is from the same party and before she ran for president she sent people to assure Obama that she wouldn’t act in the same way.
