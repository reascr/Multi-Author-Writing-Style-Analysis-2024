It doesn't make you think why it wsa being created in the lab in the first place? And it doesn't make you question if it wsa an accidental leak or on purpose? It doesn't make you wonder if the government knew the entire time how the pandemic began?
I mean, I feel like it's probably a good thing to know how a pandemic originated so we can try to not let it happen again.
And I'm sure I'll get obliterated for even asking, but can someone explain to me why it's such a big deal for everyone to get vaccinated for COVID? (I got the vaccine as early on as possibly FWIW) They originally said you couldn't get or transmit COVID once vaccinated, so it made sense. But once both of those things proved to be untrue, doesn't it just become a personal choice at that point?
And I don't think I misunderstood that quote. You can read the entire exchange from the official whitehouse.gov transcript. I don't understand why both things can't be true. The vaccines are a good thing and people shouldn't be afraid of them, but at the same time many people in positions of power, the President included, made false claims about it to reduce vaccine hesitancy and push people to get it.
Okay, so in off the cuff statements it was said a couple of times, but unless you weren't paying any attention whatsoever to any other media and knew absolutely nothing about any other vaccines, then you would probably be smart enough to realize that there was still a chance you could get COVID even if you were vaccinated.
I think you misunderstood that quote though, he was speaking to one specific person, they got vaccinated and didn’t catch Covid, so technically he wasn’t lying or wrong. You must have just misunderstood why he was talking to.
