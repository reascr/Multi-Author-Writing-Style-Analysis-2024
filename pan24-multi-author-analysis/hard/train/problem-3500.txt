It seems to mostly come down to the fact that Meadows has a long-established residency in North Carolina, and that state law explicitly says you don't lose your residency in the state if you are out of state for political service, which Meadows was while he served in the legislature, and then as White House chief of staff.
They are in the article. Those arguments are that Meadows had a long-established residency in North Carolina, that he was in Washinon, D.C. for political service, and that state law explicitly says that political service is a legitimate reason to be out of state while remaining a permanent resident of North Carolina. As for the address they registered at, it's true that they didn't own it, but they did sign a standard year0-long lease to rent there. And while it looks like Meadows himself never visited the address where he was registered to vote, it looks like evidence shows his wife spent a lot more time there than it initially appeared, which is very consistent with a married couple that is still a permanent resident of NC but one of whom is temporarily working out of state.
This doesn't look particularly suspicious, honestly, and pushing too hard here risks drawing lines that are inconsistent with existing settled law. For example, it's okay for college students who are studying out of state to re-register to vote if their parents move while they are still out of state, even if they've never been to their new permanent address.
When I moved here, I sent a note to my former state via their website informing them I had moved so did my registration and voting in NC. Right away, the former state got all on my case about voting somewhere else and said they suspected fraud. I pointed out that if they can't read their own website forms that it wasn't my fault. It shut them up.
