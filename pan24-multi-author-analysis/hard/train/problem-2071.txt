These stories are happening constantly. They need to be highlighted and heavily discussed on the news every single day until every anti choice law is repealed.
So many women and little girls are being forced to experience devastating psychological trauma, having their physical health harmed, their futures irreparably shattered, and their actual lives put at risk bc Republicans decided to enact a nonsensical and medieval mentality about controlling women in the 21st century.
This is absolute madness and inane cruelty - Texas legislators subjected this woman to mental & physical torture and forced her to the brink of death for no reason whatsoever beyond their own petty ambitions.
People in Texas bemoan the governor and higher elected officials - but Texas cannot and will not change unless the electorate pays more attention to state representative elections, unless the Democrats in Texas (i.e., the most woefully inept and disorganized bunch of Eyeores ever assembled) get their shit together.
The republican state legislators are lazy and unintelligent. Their staffs are lazy and uninformed. They meet with lobbyists, who compose their legislation, in hotel ballrooms eating chilled shrimp next to ornate ice sculptures. The Texas legislature is so seriously flawed and decayed as an institution that any attempt at repairing it would be akin to trying to swat flies away from a cowâ€™s asshole.
