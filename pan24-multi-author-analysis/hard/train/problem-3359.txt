I know, the Russian forces have caused untold suffering and widespread damage all across the country. I'm sure we will only hear worse to come.
The Ukrainians have fought tooth and nail for their homeland and I'm rooting for them. They have displayed tactical cunning and real military discipline taking back land the Russians took, and for all the deserved criticism, Zelenskyy has proven himself a true leader. I grudgingly accept other nations must continue to support Ukraine pushing back the Russian forces. But it really feels like a matter of when, not if, now.
They're untrained, ill-equipped and undirected, so they're destroying everything in sight. And unfortunately that's a worse outcome for the Ukrainians.
Worst case scenario if you underestimate you enemy is exactly what we are seeing with Ukraine withstanding the Russia.
Russiaâ€™s military has been very underwhelming so far, but the worst thing that we can do right now is dismiss it as a threat. If we do dismiss them as a threat, why should countries continue to give Ukraine aid if they managed so far? It is still a war and if Russia was so incompetent why is it not over already. The worst thing that you can do in war is not take your enemy seriously.
Worst case scenario if you overestimate your enemy and are wrong is a bunch of funny ha ha memes about them being a paper tiger.
