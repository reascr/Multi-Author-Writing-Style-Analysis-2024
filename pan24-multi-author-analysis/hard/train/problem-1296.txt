media: Trump did this horrible thing, Trump signed this horrible law, Trump appointed judges, Mitch did this bad thing. senator X holds up this bill.
The media mentions that democracy is under attack but always fucuses on the big elections. They rarely mention that one of the fixes is for people to vote every chance they get. Vote ever year in every primary and we might get more politicians in place that will do what the people want.
The problem is that it’s not the candidate as much as it is the voters. As long as the United States has a substantial number of voters voting for this kind of crap there will be those looking to please this group of voters.
There are millions of voters in the anti-Trump coalition who are default GOP and fucking desperate to get back to voting for gunz n’ low taxes. DeSantis and Rupert Murdoch (et al.) understand this, and there will be untold billions pumped into free-to-consume media portraying Ron D as the Sensible and Acceptable Alternative to Trump.
Which is why we are going to get billions pumped into free-to-consume media portraying him as the Sensible Alternative.
You’re right to point out that my argument involves something of a logical leap- Ron DeSantis in his uncut form probably won’t actively appeal to many of these “gettable” voters. My bet is that he will have the canniness (and outside assistance) to tone it down juuuuust enough if/when he’s forced out of the Bubble, while still playing to the fashmob when he goes on Fox etc.
I am pretty convinced of this, but I also allow for the fact that I could be wrong. The least we can do, though, is guard against complacency.
