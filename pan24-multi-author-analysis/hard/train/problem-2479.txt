You copy pasted a lot but did you read it? The court is arguing that not acting on climate change immediately might cause huge losses of freedom in the future. Children born today will lose many of their freedoms as adults just so the adults of today can procrastinate on climate change for another decade.
Do you actually care about preventing climate change or are you just here to be an edgy 15 year old?
As to why companies don’t do this on their own - carbon energy is cheap and the externalities (emissions) are paid for by everyone in the form of climate change.
They aren't, and the carbon tax properly prices the externality of co2 emissions, which until now everyone had been bearing as a shared cost to the environment.
It’s possible to set up a carbon tax that pushes most of the cost into the polluting corporations isn’t there? That’s what I thought the plan was all along - consumers would get the vast majority of the money back via tax breaks - the tax burden in those instances pushed onto those who actually pollute. That’s how we were implementing this thing here in Canada.
Says the Canadian (Avg. emissions/cap 2021: 14.3 tons CO2) to the Swede (Avg. emissions/cap 2021: 3.42 tons CO2) about the average Scandinavian (emissions/cap 2021: 5.33 tons CO2). , ].
