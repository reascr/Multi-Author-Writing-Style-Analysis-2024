And worth noting that Trump's FBI had possession of the laptop in question for a year or more before Trump left office; I am guessing if they had found anything remotely incriminating at all, Trump would have been on Fox News with all the details.
Literally every time a reporter sees this person, they need to ask them specifically why Hunter Biden's laptop is more important than Donald Trump stealing a trove of top secret documents.
There's literally no possible prosecution that could come out of that laptop, and everybody in the Republican party who is talking about it knows this.
It's not even just practically unreliable. The chain of custody on that was corrupted so badly that it and everything to do with it is completely inadmissible for any court anywhere in the United States.
You'd have to appeal a ruling on that evidence all the way up there, somehow, and if they did rule this admissible it would destroy criminal prosecution rules in the US overnight. There would be no restrictions on valid and invalid evidence. Abolishing the idea of chain of custody is beyond insane.
