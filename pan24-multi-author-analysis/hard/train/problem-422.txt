It’s a stretch to say it recognizes sovereignty, it is mentioned twice in article I and once in fourteen amendments.
“14th Amendment Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”.
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states that "Congress shall have the power to regulate Commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes".
Tribes are all subordinate to the federal government, as the U.S. Constitution gives plenary (i.e., near absolute) power over Indian tribes to Congress. Thus, “tribes” (in the legal sense of the word) only have existence if the federal government recognizes the tribe as existing. If the government doesn’t recognize a claimed tribe, then for legal purposes it’s not a tribe.
To terminate a tribe, Congress just passes a law stating the tribe no longer exists. The law will dissolve any tribal government functions, disestablish any reservation, and apportion/sell off the land.
This harkens back to the disastrous of the 1940's-1960's where Congress abolished & privatized reservation trust land and dissolved American Indian tribal governments. My tribe was terminated in 1954-1974. Valuable prime real estate was then sold off against our will by a non-Native run corporation. This news is deeply disturbing to me.
