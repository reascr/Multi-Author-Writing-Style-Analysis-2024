Puts a lot of stuff in perspective. My flight over was incredibly uncomfortable due to faulty climate control, I didn't catch a wink of sleep, just sweated my ass off on a 10-hour overnight flight- But they spent time in Russian detention due to suspicions about their Visas, so... Perspective.
Attended a wedding this summer with a couple who left Russia to attend the wedding and were never returning. Her parents were high up in the military, super pro-Putin and she was like "yeah, so... Fuck em, basically.".
Yes. Because their media is allowed to tell both sides of the story and their government has an opposition party who is able to challenge Putin without fear of being thrown out a window.
Working on a project here in Canada with a Russian national from Washinon state. The guy believed to his core that kids were getting killed by Ukrainian Nazis. This guy lives in the west, but the propaganda goes deep to the bone. Now imagine in Russia where they are only getting one side of the story.
Russian here... For all people, who suffer because of this war - I am sorry that our govrenment and their puppets do.
Please, just know, there are Russians that know the truth and are sorry for everything, but can't do anything, because we are hostages of that horrible regime.
