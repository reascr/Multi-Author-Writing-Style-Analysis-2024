Russia paying the price for twenty years of aggression and murder for bargain basement prices too. "So General, if we keep all this old Cold War equipment we bought when I was still in the Senate we'd have to keep paying to maintain and store it just in case WW3 breaks out, right?".
Yup. The world is in this situation with Ukraine today because twice before the international community has done essentially nothing when Putin twice invaded the territory of sovereign neighbors: Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. The world let Russia invade South Ossetia, Crimea, and the Donbas with almost zero consequences. Why wouldn’t Putin think that he could continue taking land and destabilizing the region if they aren’t subservient?
Hitler got away with taking the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, and it encouraged him to sign a pact with Stalin for the Nazis and Soviets to invade and divide up Poland. The world needs to remember this, because we are currently repeating the same mistakes, and just getting lucky that Russia is so much more incompetent than the Nazis were (not to diminish the stellar job that Ukraine has been doing to defend themselves).
they wouldn’t, Putin maybe a an asshole and cunt but he isn’t stupid, he attacked Ukraine before they apply for NATO, he isn’t attacking any NATO country because it would be straight up suicide and his own administration would kill him for it.
It wouldn’t be a sustainable situation, but Russia wouldn’t be moving an inch further would directly attacking NATO troops.
Minimum they would do in that scenario, if Russia somehow did it by surprise (which wouldn’t be possible) is deploy troops and wait for a Russian offensive.
In the real world however we would notice Russian troops massing for an attack and then set up our defensive line preemptively. Russia then has no wiggle room, it’s war or bluff.
