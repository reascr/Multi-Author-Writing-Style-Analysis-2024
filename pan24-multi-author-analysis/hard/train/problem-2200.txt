People are gullible enough to take their PR dog and pony virtual signaling show seriously? Where else could these people show off their private jets?
I guess it's pretty easy to spot that in this case the use of private jets is certainly not worth the cost. As long as the WEF continues to value economic growth as the highest goal, then they will not have a positive impact, because they will always sacrifice the environment for growth. For that they will be defended by primarily right-leaning pundits and their audience, who describe any deviation from this as "socialism". After all, the people attending are those that .
It means the meeting is in person and likely has a far higher attendance from wealthy / powerful people. Both are certainly very important things. In person increases the likelihood of success and similarly a higher attendance by such people means the outcome has more of an impact.
Now counterbalance it with the cost of private jet use and the track record of the WEF in recent years. Which is pretty much non existent to even hindering in regards to climate change.
Climate change will be discussed. By people who not only have the carbon footprint of a charcoal sasquatch, but also not sense of irony.
