And if you think that democrat leaders aren’t pushing being violent, you need to look at Shelia Lee Jackson’s words, Nancy Pelosi’s words, and spread em wide Harris’s words, Schumer’s words. All four of them pushed for violence towards others. Shelia even threatened a federal court with a riot if it didn’t decide they way she wanted it to. Hell…sleepy joe called everyone who voted for someone other than him a threat to democracy. He also said “if you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black”. Pretty funny from the guy who created and passed a law that disproportionately imprisoned POC on three strike drug laws. What was that Pelosi said about not shipping immigrants north because they need them to “pick the crops”? Not a small bit of stereotyping there, is there? Or should we go into the Kente scarves they wore for a news op, not understanding that the Ashanti tribes captured and enslaved thousands. What racism were you talking about again?
First off, you’re going to need to understand what a fascist is. You apparently don’t. You also need to understand what a dictator is, something else you obviously don’t.
Because one is moving towards a fascist dictatorship and one isn't. Greedy, corrupt corporate Democrats aren't manifesting violence by telling the dumbest people exactly what they want to hear. They're just getting rich by telling moderately stupid people exactly what they want to hear. If you think those are the same, why not just be honest and say that you like the racism?
