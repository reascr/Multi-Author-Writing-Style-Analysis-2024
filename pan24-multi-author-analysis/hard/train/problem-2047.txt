I guess I should clarify Draft in defense of one’s homeland, not to fight a war away from home. My point os it shouldn’t be up to just the brave, or just up to men to defend the homeland. It should be a pure lottery with no deferments. I Personally would not follow through with any draft of their was deferments of any kind or sexism involved.
So you are just a pussy I gather? People have to defend their homeland from time to time, sorry it offends you but it’s reality. It’s nice to think other people should defend your life, but you don’t have to do anything.
I'm not asking anyone to defend my life. If a country attacks mine or vice versa I have the right to decide if I think the conflict is worth fighting for or not. If its not then my death is not the automatic outcome even if my country losses. I'd have to weigh the consequences of that situation out and decide if I thought it was worth it or not.
I'm also saying no nation state should have the ability to grab someone off the street and force them into a situation where their life is in danger against their will. Especially when threatening them with prison or death for not complying.
If you need to threaten your own people with prison or death to get them to fight then seriously why even bother?
No the point is people don't ever have to be forced into a situation where their lives are in danger. If your country is worth anything at all people will volunteer. If its not then its frankly not worth the loss of life to defend it or fight for it.
