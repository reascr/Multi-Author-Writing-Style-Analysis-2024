In any army, a ton of manpower is spent on non-combat roles: truck drivers, military police, construction, guarding supply lines, and also patrolling and protecting the country’s borders. With a peacetime army, I’d be wasting trained soldiers escorting supply convoys, protecting rear areas, and just loading and unloading shit on and off trains and trucks. If I had a ton of new conscripts, I’d put my conscripts in these roles and move the trained soldiers to the front lines. I’d also use conscripts to guard non-conflict borders and move the combat troops from there to the front lines.
It's not as simple as shifting the best soldiers to the frontline and replacing them with untrained conscripts. The conscripts might decide it's better to fight for their own freedom instead of some vague objective in Ukraine, particularly if all the "real" troops are busy at the frontline.
Considering he didn't specify, he can as well bring in some fuel/ammo/weapons with him and fight for the Ukrainians... Maliciously complying with his words...
The thing is - before the mobilization occurred a lot of Russians thought of war as a place where they'll go, fight a little bit and get awards.
This isn't any major rebellion, but at the very least it shows that Russians are getting aware of what is really happening.
They didn't really think of it as a place of death, suffering and despair. But now they understand the truth since their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers are on the battlefield - and they also find out some information about the state and how it lies to them.
