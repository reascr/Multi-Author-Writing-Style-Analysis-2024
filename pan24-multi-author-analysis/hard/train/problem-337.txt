China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has been on a high-stakes tour of Europe, defending his country’s interests in a clash with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and reaffirming Beijing’s friendship with Russia with a visit to Moscow.
After meeting with Mr. Wang in Moscow on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin’s top security aide said Russia backed China on a range of issues.

Portending a Global Rift: Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that China is strongly considering giving military aid to Russia, a move that would transform the war into a struggle involving three superpowers.
If China does begin selling weapons and supplies to Russia it will probably trigger US led financial sanctions against them.
As Europe and the United States, again, pressure Beijing not to aid Russia’s war, China has few options for responding. Even as it privately tries to soothe concerns, in public it has sought to look firm.
