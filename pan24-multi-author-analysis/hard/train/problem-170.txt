Halloween is canceled apparently….well maybe that’s why it was set for November to go into effect. Dance recitals, cheerleading competitions, school plays….
Gentle reminder that beauty pageants, concerts, prom nights, cheerleading, and dance performances would all fit under this. It's our duty to help enforce the law, so be sure to report these if this bill is passed.
Then it will be fair when the police are doing the enforcement. They could even have a special police force. It could be called the FASHION police! Man that would be so FUNNY.
Honestly, it will probably be way easier on everyone if, instead of outlawing styles of dress as unacceptable, they gave everyone a list of clothing and makeup that meets acceptable standards.
No on second thought we shouldn't make jokes about something so serious. Maybe call them the Morality Police? Yeah that sounds way better!
See everyone? I worked out the kinks in just a few paragraphs I bet these well qualified legislators have everything under control Nothing will go wrong!
