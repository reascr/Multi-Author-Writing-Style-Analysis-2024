It's not quite 48%. Trump only won in 16 because he was a complete unknown politically and was able to get independents to vote for him. I don't see independents voting for a far right kook like DeSantis. Not with a safe centrist incumbent to vote for in Biden.
So what's the point of a second term for Biden then? He won't even be able to get supreme court seats. Odds are the 2026 midterms will be another loss as well for Dems if he is still president. How big of a Republican majority are you willing to give them just for another 4 years of a biden and a Republican Congress?
I'd rather have 2 years of a slight Republican trifecta from 2024 to 2026 then get stuck with a huge Republican majority in 2028 that persists for 4-6 years or longer.
Those who voted for Biden and will vote for him in 2024 need to understand they are historically making it easier for Republicans to win congressional seats in the following elections. That's the cost of holding the presidency.
And I already said why holding the Presidency is still important. The GOP would be unable to pass any of their agenda. That alone makes it worth it.
