They're trying to get rid of corruption, so they can resemble an EU member state, instead of resembling an ex Soviet Union state, with close ties to Russia.
We shouldn’t underestimate how much corruption is part of the very culture of government in Ukraine as it is in Russia.
So long as we have leverage in the form of military aid to Ukraine, we need to use that leverage maximally to rid the country of corruption, whether Zelenskyy likes it or not.
If you mean the corruption tricked Russia into thinking it would take less than a week to take Ukraine, then that is probably part of it, buy Zelensky had been running on fighting corruption since he was made leader.
Are you suggesting that the only way for Zelenskyy to maintain power is for him to appease corrupt officials by allowing them to steal? Even during war time, when the state traditionally is given additional powers to fight against corruption?
To be fair, before he attempts to expand government it's probably good to get rid of the corrupting forces and finish the war for their very survival first.
I mean the corruption is affecting the war, it isn’t as if resources aren’t being co-opted by these corrupt officials that can be used to fuel the war effort.
That corruption is literally killing his countrymen fighting on the ground by depriving them of the equipment and resources they need. I think he would have the backing of his people to do whatever he needs to do to get that under control.
