Lol I noticed that on the press conference a few days ago. The one held by whats his name, lloyd austin? The US defense guy and the general.
Anyway so this journalist asked «Why are you holding back Poland from donations?» and he goes «we are not, Poland is free to make their own donations» I fucking laughed, don’t need a backstory to tell what’s been going on there.
Somebody at that press conference basically asked Austin, "Why did you stop Poland from giving MiG-29s to Ukraine?".
It makes far more sense to put the jets on a train from Poland to Ukraine (which is ultimately what they did) than it does to fly the jets from Germany into Ukraine, especially since Russia still has essentially all of Ukraine within theoretical range of their long-range ground-based air defenses.
They didn't, though. Poland wanted the US to let the Ukrainians fly the jets into Ukraine from Ramstein (America's primary base in Europe), and the US basically said, no, if you want to give jets to Ukraine, do it yourself directly. Poland eventually sent the jets to Ukraine disguised as spare parts, but in the public consciousness, the US still got the blame for blocking Poland.
Its not "scapegoating" Poland, its just setting things straight with the tremendous amount of bullshit coming from them. The whole blockade thing was a straight up lie, and honestly, that was just the last in a long line of insults. Poland is a great country, the current polish government is a burning shitshow tho.
And besides that, fuck off with your "Poland far right" bullshit. Maybe look first at Germany, the only country in Europea where mob of ordinary citizens wanted to burn alive hundreds of refugees, and where nazi terrorists could murder foreigners with approval of state security service.
