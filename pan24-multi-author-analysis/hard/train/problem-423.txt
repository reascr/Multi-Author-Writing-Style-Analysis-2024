China could blockade Taiwan to restrict certain imports/exports and hold Taiwan's economy hostage. If America doesn't intervene, Taiwan's government will have to either surrender or watch its economy crumble.

Wouldnâ€™t China have more to gain from trading with Taiwan than spending a lot of effort destroying it, taking the damage from Taiwan counter attacks, and the global economic fallout?
As on the same line of reasoning China will not be suiciding it's air force and navy in a conventional battle over Taiwan either, or risk its most commercially productive population centres over Taiwan etc etc.
I don't know if taking what happened during the Taiwan Strait Crisis when China barely had a navy or air force or any anti-ship cruise missiles and wasn't the US' largest trading partner and the manufacturing centre of the world is terribly relevant to a war that would occur today or in the future.
