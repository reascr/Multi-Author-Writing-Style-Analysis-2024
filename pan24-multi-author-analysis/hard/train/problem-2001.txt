Modi has often said in public that he had asked neighbouring states(which were ruled by opposition at that time) for help with more police but they denied him support.
For pt 4) he asked other states for help as his police force at that time was not adequate to stop rioting immediately and other states should have helped.
Also I am not making this in my mind PM Modi has literally said it on national media to rajdeep Sardesai in an interview.
Opposition and Pakistan try to corner modi and blame him for incident. But the riots were controlled within 2 days.
While i condemn the loss of human life, it would not be right to blame modi for it as he did as much as he could(he had only been in position of power for less than 2 years and being from a very humble background he didn't have much experience of handling such situations but still riots were controlled within 2-3 days and all guilty were punished).
Godhra train incident happened when 59 karsevaks were burnt alive by a Muslim mob. It sparked of riots in entire of Gujarat for next 2-3 days killing more than 600 Muslims and 300 Hindus.
Riots happened in Gujarat in 2002 after a train was set on fire and about 50-60 people were burned alive. The perpetrators were said to be muslims and the victims were said to be Hindus. Some of which participate in the Babri masjid demolition. There was a huge loss of life during the riots.
