In a perfect world, Afghan women would all be allowed to leave Afghanistan, immediately. That would solve the problem the spineless Taliban seem to have with women, and in a few years, would solve the world's Taliban problem.
Just because reddit lacks all ability to see nuance in an argument I agree that women should be able to leave and that the Taliban are nutjobs. I am just sick of people pointing at religious nutjobs and saying those “brainwashed men” are doing this… There is always a group of nutty women in the dumpster fire with the probably majority men group.
If you don’t think there is a surprising amount of hardcore brainwashed religious women that want this too you don’t know that like most groups of people they don’t unanimously agree on anything.
One wonders how much is religious vs. wanting power/subordination over women and using religion as the excuse. It’ll be different for each person. Either way it sucks.
This is awful, simply awful. But for God’s sake, keep the heck out of Afghanistan. You might as well try to make life easier for the citizens of hell.
