Thanks for this info! I've never heard of Pritzker before. It's exciting to learn that there might be some Dems who aren't in the spotlight who are considering running in 2024.
Are you saying Dems are grading him for reelection on a curve because he's done a great job on pursuing his agenda? Or are you saying grading him pursuing his agenda on a curve would result in a "great job?".
YES. I wish more people understood this. Politics are fucking boring and they are meant to be boring. I don't want to be entertained, I want to be governed. There's no shortage of venues for entertainment these days.
Trump is a showman and was a constant source of dopamine for 4 years. Even people who hate him (me, I'm those people) got some entertainment value out of him. But I don't want to be entertained, I want a functioning government. And I want them to do all the boring shit that government does. And Biden has been doing a bang up job in that regard from where I'm sitting.
This is a classic problem for Democrats, and lately I've been thinking that it's less because Democrats are bad at messaging and more because politics and governing are supposed to be fucking boring and procedural and we're living in a time where we are constantly being entertained and stimulated. We collectively have no attention span. We hop from one stupid story to the next. The average person doesn't have the fortitude to tackle complex boring shit that politicians are supposed to tackle.
Politics isn't about finding a mythical median voter and adopting all their policies. People with "change stuff" messages and no long term political history win the presidency as frequently as institutionalists.
