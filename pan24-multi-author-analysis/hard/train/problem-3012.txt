It's complicated. NATO bombed the shit out of Serbia with methods most people in NATO countries would call barbaric in any other circumstances, and before that the countries that you mentioned were nothing but happy to endorse the dissolution of Yugoslavia without any consideration of the consequences, because commies bad and freedom good.
Media in Europe and America, particularly because of the Kosovo conflict, has massively oversimplified the Yugoslav wars and the narrative that emerged seems to have put most of the blame on Serbs as a whole, underestimating the guilt of other groups (it is hard for people to understand a conflict where basically everyone is the bad guy, if i may be simplistic) and also not understanding the complex political differences between for example Serbian people, the government in what is now Serbia, and the Serb paramilitary groups who committed the worst atrocities. They are connected, but not the same. Serbs are resentful of this. This makes the internal politics of questions like who to align with very difficult.
The remnants of the war have also supercharged the right wing nationalism that helped start the war in the first place, so things in this regard have become worse and this drives anti-west, pro-Russia politics that other illiberal democracies in southern and eastern Europe seem so susceptible to.
an "invasion" by russia doesnt have to be with soldiers, just shove in lots of russians like in the Donbas and then stir up the local hatred for some reason to undermine the government.
The point isn't about "fear" in the context of this discussion, the point is about Russia exerting greater influence than just in Russia and Belarus (and, I guess, regions they occupy such as in Ukraine or Georgia).
But I mean, there are simpler examples of Russia's presence and influence worldwide, such as their notorious interference in other countries' political and mediatic systems.
