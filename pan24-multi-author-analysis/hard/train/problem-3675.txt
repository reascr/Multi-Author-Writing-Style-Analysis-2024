Not sure why it is a separate resolution and not an amendment to the original as Bernie proposed. This sets up an awkward scenario wherein only one of the resolutions may pass leaving the railroad workers boned.
The Democrats, who will ultimately be the deciding factor in these resolutions are expected to fight for unions though, and if the sick-leave resolution fails then so will they.
Whatever people think of the democrats forcing the unions to accept the contract, it’s a clever move so that people can see that republicans and their corporate masters hate giving workers sick leave.
The idea that Congress would force a contract on workers whose unions rejected it makes me physically sick with disgust and rage.
It makes it clear that the republicans are the ones who don’t want paid OR unpaid sick leave, not the democrats. The dems are in a bad position because there’s a lot of pressure on them to keep the economy running at a time when it’s basically teetering on the brink. Fuck republicans, this wouldn’t be a problem at all if it weren’t their life’s mission to destroy workers.
