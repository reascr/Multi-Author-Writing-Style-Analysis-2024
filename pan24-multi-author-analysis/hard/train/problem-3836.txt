The state will be free to form itâ€™s own legislation and internal structure with no oversight by any entity. Free association means the US would take care of defense and maybe also foreign policy.
OK, so this is a discussion about Compacts of Free Association with the US. Currently three countries have entered into such compacts: Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. None of these countries was "taken from the Spanish during the Spanish American war in the late 19th century... to expand American colonial reach.".
yeah. morally its the right thing to do, theyve voted to become a state in all 3 of the last votes on it ive seen. but it takes 3/5ths of senators to pass, or 60. so unless they can get 10 republican senators to back this to prevent a fillabuster it wont happen. and since it would end up adding two new senators to congress, and they'd most likely be democrats, the republicans will never go for this.
i agree in principle but as with everything it is a complicated matter. as far as i know some of these territories have voted to keep the status quo. as opposed to PR that wants to join the union.
I'd be very happy to see them join the union. It would finally give them representation in congress, and I imagine it would substantially improve their economic situation. And I think having a Latin American state would go a long way in promoting diversity within the US.
