Saudi Arabia serves far more countries than just the US. Were the US to actually forcibly remove the Saudi government to put one of our own choice in place there would be global issues and possibly an actual military response. The reason the US has gotten away with moves like that in the past is because the country’s they did so too we’re firstly fairly hostile to most world powers and secondly had actually given the US an excuse to attack them (flimsy as they were in many cases) Saudi Arabia has given no such excuse and is on “friendly” terms with several global powers including Russia, China and many of the US’s European allies. Such a move would not be at all well received on the international stage. The fact is the world still needs oil for now (although the time is rapidly approaching where that is no longer true) and that means the Saudi’s are in prime position to dictate international terms as they are one of the few countries with abundant amounts of oil. Realistically the best thing the US could do to reduce its dependence on them would be to ramp up our own oil production to fill our needs and continue to invest in alternatives wherever possible. Many of our major power stations for example could be transferred away from fossil fuel power to nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and wind power. We’ve had the ability to do this for decades and have not done so, because 1 it’s expensive in the short term and 2 the Saudis and a few other major oil dealers bribe our politicians to keep them from making strides in that direction.
Oil is what everyone thinks at first, but the truth is that the Saudis (And others in the region) use London, NYC, Miami, and LA as their personal money laundromats. Lawmakers depend on that more than barrels of dino juice.
