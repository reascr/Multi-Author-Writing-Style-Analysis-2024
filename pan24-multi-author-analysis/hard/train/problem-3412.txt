I wouldn't support a wholesale repeal, but it could probably stand to be rewritten to restore some responsibility and delineate what they are or aren't responsible for.
Yes, both of those things are true-- its why rational people support background checks for gun purchases and permit systems, and car manufacturers are subject to regulations on a car's safety features and ability to follow traffic laws. The question isn't whether they have responsibility, its how they are legally obligated to fulfill those responsibilities. Reasonably, it would mean transparent algorithms subject to regulation, and moderation policies subject to regulation.
The core problem at issue here is whether algorithmic recommendations constitute editorial control of said content. The result would either mean that websites can exercise 0 control of their content, or they must maintain complete control of all content.
But best of all, when websites crack down on hateful content, or close because they can't moderate to the legal requirements, who will republican voters blame? The government^tm and liberals obviously. Government regulations obviously killed your favorite website, and the only ones left are liberal tech companies that are deleting your constitutional speech Vote for republicans to pack the courts to fix the problem /s.
Republicans are on the attack not because of the RE but the FE- the TX and FL social media laws are aimed at eliminating editorial discretion and forcing big tech’s REs to normalize right-wing content that’s widely agreed to be extreme now without the intervention of an FE.
