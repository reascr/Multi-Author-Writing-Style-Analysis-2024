That person is going to have a hard time going forward. More people are choosing less traditional names for their kids nowadays, and many of them will sound "black or foreign" because they likely are.
Having gone to school, I think some of these parents are making a bigger deal out of this stuff than the kids who go to these schools are. Kids will use all sorts of things to segregate other students into cliques, but it's because they want to belong to a special group, not because they inherently care about all these race or cultural issues. That may shift in high school, as kids become more individualistic in their beliefs, but they're also highly influenced by their own social groups....but overall, talking to any kid about many of these issues, and they usually just shrug it off because they think it's stupid.
I feel for the teachers, and hate what's happening, but the above question is something that I feel has been left out of the whole conversation.
What’s so frustrating about this is that it’s school principals being quoted. Teacher here, our lives are FAR worse than that of a principal. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a cake walk to be a principal either. But they make our lives hell. Not only are we so often the first people to get screamed at, we also have to deal with bull shit bureaucracy from principals. It’s fucking awful enough to be a teacher and now I have to do additional lesson plans, curriculum maps, oh, and I have to handle discipline myself because admin won’t do shit.
I teach in a rural, poverty stricken area. So it’s not a culture war around me. The war is over in my area, and public education lost.
