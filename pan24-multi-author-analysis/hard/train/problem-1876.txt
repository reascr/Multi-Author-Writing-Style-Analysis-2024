Given our ties to Ukrainian energy companies competing with the Russian gas market in Europe, I think it'd be prudent of us to put any suspicion of ourselves at ease (or take responsibility and offer our apologies and dedicated atonement to freezing, as well as any other energy consumers around the globe who might have been adversely affected economically by this despicable act of ecocidal terrorism, if be the case.).
Personally, I wouldn't want the Democrats controlling the investigation of the Nordstream 2 bombing.
And I just wouldn't like to see the House of Representatives trying to politicize a terrorist attack on foreign soil.
Cool, so I assume that you would be willing to address the fact that the Keystone PipelineÂ 2017 spill happened while both houses of legislature and the executive office were held by Republicans and they had even less to say than in the spills that I mentioned before.
Wait, where is this coming from? Are you suggesting that the US is responsible for the bombing of the Nord stream 2 pipeline?
