I went to school in Florida in the late 90s and there were a lot of my classmates who were smart, driven, and cared about making a positive impact in the world. They all left Florida as soon as they could though, so the ones who actually stayed long enough to become politically active were mostly the children of the swamp people. These moves hurt all children in Florida public schools, including the ones who should have the opportunity to become smart enough to leave.
This is why DeSantis is lowering Florida's standards for schools imo. He knows his policies are driving teachers away so he does shit like make it so Florida will hire anyone from the military to be a teacher.
Also the last two elections have destroyed the Florida DNC. It seems they have lost hope with DeSantis just constantly tightening his grip and flexing on them constantly.
They are flooding the state making it trend redder and turning into a red fortress even as other states trend bluer. In some part because their crazy red voters are migrating to Florida.
