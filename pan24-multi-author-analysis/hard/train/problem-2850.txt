That such an absurdly illogical argument is being parroted as fact is a great argument against freedom of speech.
The Saudis don't give a damn about that. They were just looking out for their own economy, which is petrol based and would be damaged by low oil prices. Which is also why Biden didn't actually do anything, because he knew it as well as I do.
So we helped them bomb the Houthis to dislodge a government that is friendly to Iran, because we aren't fond of the Iranian regime either.
Not for their egos, but because pro Iran Houthi militias overthrew the government and waged a brutal civil war against the former government. Since the Saudis hate the Iranian government and were allies of the previous Yemeni government, they intervened.....and got their butts kicked for the same reasons Russia did.
Anyway, I wasn’t trying to argue about who is better or worse, my point is, if you wanted Saudi Arabia to act in a certain way that is beneficial to you, you need to not threaten the country for a start.
If the US didn’t want Saudi Arabia to alter its oil production, then the US shouldn’t have vowed to make Saudi Arabia an “international pariah”, removed the houthis from the terrorist list, and threatened to halt arms shipments.
Every time I hear the Saudis wanting to blackmail the global energy market i get so infuriated they just commit an awful war with the most high tech US weaponry for their egos essentially.
