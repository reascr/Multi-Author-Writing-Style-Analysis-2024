Which was the only way the norwegian producers could get congress to accept buying it for the american forces. (American jobs!).
I say go for it. Their caterwauling isn’t going to change anything in Ukraine, Joe sure as hell isn’t going to back down. You’re just making Biden look even more bad-ass. As the “strong on defense” party, your natural move should have been to criticize him for not doing enough. But if you want to blow up your coalition? I don’t mind.
I don't see why people are so worried over this. It's essentially the same strategy used in SVD before pulling back: You hold ground and bleed them as much as possible before falling back. Then counter-punch them elsewhere grabbing large amounts of territory in return.
One of the Tweets showed it was in the Dnipro delta. I have no idea why it would go into such an exposed position. There isn't much room to maneuver in a river...
Going to be interesting to see if/what offensive UA does in March. Theoretically they could even have those 50 Bradleys by then, but I don't know if they would be trained up on them in time. Any new mobilization RU does in a few weeks will be similarly poorly trained and equipped conscripts, so I can't see them amounting to much. And then UA can do another breakout and demoralize them taking a lot of territory in the Melitopol/Kherson salient.
