Dems not only need high voter turnout, they need their voters to not do split ticket voting in swing states.. if you are a Dem voter, this would be the worst possible time to do something like voting for Shapiro and Oz, or voting for Warnock and Kemp, or Kelly and Lake (sadly polls show many are leaning to vote that way).
Indiana voter turnout in 2020 was 65% - the higher you go, the more gerrymandering falls apart, because most of the time districts go with a couple percentage points of margin, which is blown away by a couple percentage points more of turn out.
This is a lie they tell you because they know it does. Think about it, why would they waste their breath / effort if it didnâ€™t? The reality is gerrymandering only works with low voter turnout - the second you have a ton of turnout it falls apart, because it hinges on apathy.
Between voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the fact that the electoral college gives more voting power to dirt than to citizens, the deck is pretty well stacked against democracy.
Meanwhile, I recommend voting for whichever of your representation options is not actively trying to undermine our democracy, so that we can expand our options in the future, rather than being stuck with a one-party state.
I suggest pushing for ranked choice voting, to help level the playing field for candidates from additional parties, widening our choices.
