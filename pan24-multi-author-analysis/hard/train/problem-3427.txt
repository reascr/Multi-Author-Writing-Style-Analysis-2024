Tbh historically China has been pretty chill and usually on the right side of conflicts, they are communists under dictatorship but they aren't stupid.
They don't need to decline, having Zelenskiy in China doing nothing beside peace talk will boost China's images in international politics. The thing is, China isn't going to betray the essential policies with Russia the way Zelenskiy thinks he could do.
There's a lot of nonsense in the Chinese policy position (it really isn't a plan), but my favourite is China's call to end sanctions against Russia. Can't have those "unilateral" (ie. agreed by dozens of countries but not China) interfering with profitable trade with Russia.
Because China is the only country with real leverage over Russia. Chinese industrial power is keeping Russia afloat. Without China, Russia is toast.
China has 10x that amount of people. China invests 6x the amount that Russia does, and they leave out a bunch of military-related categories from their annual budget so who knows what the real number is. Again, let’s not ignore their industrial base. It’s fucking massive and they’re throwing investment at it. That’s how they’re able to produce so much naval tonnage every year.
Russia only has 140 million people. That’s fewer than the population of Pakistan, or Indonesia. In all honesty when you consider that Russia is a low-income country with a 140m population while maintaining a massive land area, it’s not a surprise that their military is doing so poorly.
There’s a reason why all these D.C think tanks have been publishing constant reports about China’s rapid militarization.
China can absolutely turn the tide of war in Ukraine. Would they? Probably not, I don’t fucking know. But if it’s a question of industrial military production, their base is there. It’s not 2003 anymore.
