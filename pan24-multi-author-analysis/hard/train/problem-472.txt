I mean... they have no reason to give the enemy accurate and up-to-date casualty counts and damage morale. Same reason Russia is keeping tight lipped on their losses, they have nothing to gain from doing otherwise.
I never said that random redditor is correct, I seriously doubt it's 20:1 or even 10:1 at this stage. Maybe the Russians have reasonably accurate Ukrainian casualty estimates, maybe they don't. Either way, why make it public and guarantee that they do?
I think the Ukrainians know that defending their sovereignty and freedom doesn't come without cost. Releasing concrete numbers while the war is ongoing just isn't a logical decision to make, and you can't really equate this to the US in the "global war on terror" since those two conflicts are not comparable. And the US isn't urging Ukraine to negotiate peace, they're basically just saying to be more open to it publicly and not say things like "no negotiations with Putin.".
Yup. That’s why I’m asking. I have a feeling the reality is that the war is getting really nasty for both sides, but all we are seeing is the Russian death counts. I’m pro-Ukraine (well, more anti-Russia tbh) but the propaganda is quite obvious.
