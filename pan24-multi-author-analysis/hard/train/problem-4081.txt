I always wondered why the programs on Fox that argued in court they are for entertainment, are allowed to still have the Fox News icon on the bottom right hand of the screen.
[In] the context of “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” the Court finds that Mr. Carlson’s invocation of “extortion” against Ms. McDougal is nonactionable hyperbole, intended to frame the debate in the guest commentator segment that followed Mr. Carlson’s soliloquy. As Defendant notes, Mr. Carlson himself aims to “challenge political correctness and media bias.” This “general tenor” of the show should then inform a viewer that he is not “stating actual facts” about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in “exaggeration” and “non-literal commentary.” … Given Mr. Carlson’s reputation, any reasonable viewer ‘arrive[s] with an appropriate amount of skepticism’ ….
"The "'general tenor' of the show should then inform a viewer that [Carlson] is not 'stating actual facts' about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in 'exaggeration' and 'non-literal commentary.' ".
Yes. If you think that is anywhere close to stating it was "entertainment" programming and therefore irrelevant to free speech protections, it wasn't.
That's literally saying that their speech shouldn't be protected... unless.... they do the disclaimer thing.
No one is saying it’s not protected speech. They’re saying Fox News should have to disclaim they aren’t reporting facts before it gets to court.
Yes, sort of like Fox News is getting sued for by Dominion right now. Huh, I wonder why they aren't going with the "it's just entertainment" argument in this case since that's totally something that happened in the past?
