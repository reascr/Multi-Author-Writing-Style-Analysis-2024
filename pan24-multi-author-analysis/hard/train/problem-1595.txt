I'm going to disagree. Not because I like these fucks, but because traitor has a very specific definition that is important. I don't want to water it down or get to a point where we just call everyone a traitor. Denying an election is just talk. Trying to overthrow the election results? That's treason.
Treason can carry a penalty of death. Politicians contest results all the time. There is a legal process. If you say election deniers are traitors, Republicans will start calling every when recount treasonous.
Some of these election deniers lost in their primaries and screamed fraud/rigged against their own party.
And how will election results be overturned without denying them in the first place? Just because it’s “only” the first step towards treason doesn’t mean it isn’t precisely that.
Further: they do NOT meet the standards or definition of the legal framework for ‘traitor’. In anyway.
What’s your legal training? I’m not being a jerk but I’m just trying to explain that this isn’t a simple thing. You cannot just articulate your stance with words you feel fit in a court of law. There is a literally definitional difference between an “and” or an “or” that will change how a single idea being expressed must be carried through.
