That would include Republicans, then, since they were in support of the 13th Amendment that specifically and in no uncertain language allows for involuntary servitude.
I'm pretty sure Republicans advocated and were in favor of slavery pretty often in the recent years, during efforts to remove slavery from state constitutions (like in Colorado, Utah and Nebraska) or the punishment clause of the 13th amendment.
Could at the very least be argued that Republicans put a platform to uphold the constitution and the constitution has slavery in it therefore they can get banned as well.
The fun part is when the constitution says that slavery is okay as long as its done as a form of punishment, meaning anyone who has or has ever backed the constitution has thus supported slavery. Something the new GOP does not agree with by their attempted coup, meaning you have to be anti USA to be able to run in florida. LITERALLY taking over the US, one state at a time through 'legal intervention'.
Consistency matters when you are attempting to game the system. If it doesnt pass, it'll be a call out saying that the other sides support slavery. They only lose in this scenario because they sound and look like nutjobs with every other thing they try to do and say.
Thirteenth Amendment: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.
