Well yes, but no. It's been autonomous since 1924 within whatever country it was a part of. It was originally part of the Ukrainian SSR, then the Moldovan SSR, then the Nazi Romanians took it, and then it went back to Moldova. But they always had some form of autonomous government.
When the Soviet Union broke up there was this massive power grab across the former empire. In Moldova it got incredibly bloody between the Transnistrians who wanted to join Ukraine to side with Russia and the Moldovans who wanted to join Romania. The region was created as a middle ground to allow them to join the Ukrainians (probably now Russians) if Romania and Moldova sought reunification.
Ukraine may help out later- especially since even a Crimea-less Ukraine can choke out the Russian presence- but right now Ukraine's not likely to touch it unless the TDR does something very, very stupid and convinces Ukraine to help Moldova out.
The problem for Ukraine is not that there would be fierce resistance, it's that Ukraine is currently trying to exist. While it looks like Ukraine still has the edge over its opponent due to its military and diplomatic prowess, Russia still makes advances here and there (note that Imperial Japan made territorial gains even in 1944, two years after Midway and other such battles already made it clear that Japan was going to lose), it still has to deal with the Russians in the East and South while keeping a reserve force available in case Lukashenko goes crazy.
I'd say it is more like deeply seeded Soviet propaganda that somehow has lingered and Russia is able to make use of it, but yeah it's incredibly weird, with the way things are going it really makes me wonder what the hell we'll see happening with it as an increasingly isolated region that is clearly sympathetic and dependent on a collapsing power.
