I know there are large cultural differences, but it seems like the DR should slowly annex a little slice of Haiti, modernize it, add functioning government, and when that area meets certain benchmarks for stability, add another slice etc.
Haiti is too failed to pull itself out of this by itself unfortunately and all the aid being dumped in doesn't do a thing without a functional government to administer it and build a future where it can be more independent.
When it comes to Haiti, it's not that the world hasn't tried, it's just that it's such a messed up Gordian Knot of interconnected problems that even the best development planners in the world working together with enormous budgets haven't been able to figure it out.
It's a deadly cycle. Aid erodes sovereignty, which erodes legitimacy, which creates instability, which makes aid even more necessary, and more of a treasure to fight for control over. So far, every plan to try to break that cycle has failed. Maybe the next one won't, but it won't be for lack of trying.
