if only everyone will remember that they are the ones who did this, two years from now. We need to keep reminding them. get young people to turn out again.
well I'm really sorry to hear about your circumstances. I wish there was more you could do to get out of the hole that you're in. I also live in one of those shit hole red states, unfortunately.
yeah Democrats in office really have a hard time understanding that most people have the memories of goldfish. You have to stay on message and repeat it, over and over again to really drill it home. and I get what you're saying about the courts, Joe Biden would have never made this move if it wasn't backed up by the law and economists and probably at least a dozen more advisors. I guarantee it probably is legally sound, but then we have the courts who are more interested in hurting him politically. something for Democrats to run on, you're right.
People will remember, but the democrats also have to do their part in the fight. If this somehow does get blocked by the crooked supreme court, the democrats are obliged to continue the pause or use plan B. In the worst case scenario, make it a '24 campaign issue. Make court reform a '24 campaign issue too because a decision against this will mean the courts are 100% political and the implications of that extend far beyond debt forgiveness.
