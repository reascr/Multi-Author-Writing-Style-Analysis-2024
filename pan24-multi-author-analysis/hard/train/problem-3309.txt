Yeah I understand what the 13A is, I’m asking if this proposed legislation would survive a constitutional legal challenge in the basis that it would go against 13A.
I’m not American, and obviously forced labour is bad and should be banned, but isn’t this technically unconstitutional due to the 13A? Or are the amendments not protected in the same way as the bill or rights? I’m curious to see if this bill gets challenged on those grounds.
The potential financial harm caused to for profit prisons is the angle that came to mind for me. Not a great moral argument, but people engaged in slavery likely aren’t the most moralistic of people lol. But I looked it up and it turns out California banned for profit prisons a couple years back so it’s a non starter anyway.
I was going to ask if the owner of private prisons could make a challenge but it seems like California banned private prisons in 2019. Thanks for the answer.
That’s a great point. People do want some purpose and want to work for a living. But we all need agency over that. Let them choose what they want and pay them a good wage.
