I went to the Baltics in 2014 on a choir tour. Estonians did not hold their punches in their opinions of the Soviets.
Estonia has been extremely harsh toward Russia from the early 90's. It is a brother nation of Finland, similar language and culture. During the cold war when Estonia was a Soviet Republic, they watched Finnish television. Especially traumatic was an ad figure of a Finnish super market chain, a guy who marketed various fancy meat products in TV daily. They had limited selection of meat products in The Soviet Union and that daily dose of Finnish wealth was a thing, which has been inspiring documentarists, and those western influences from Finland have been seen as important cracks in the iron curtain. Estonians watched also all kind of western series from The Finnish TV, like Dallas and Dynasty. I don't know what kind of series those were, but quite American they surely were. Quite a thing to watch American TV series every day in The Soviet Union. Literally the whole Estonian population learned to speak Finnish with The Finnish television, which made Estonian people even more close to the Finns.
Exactly. That is the documentary. I have seen it. Of course one factor in that thing is, that Finland is culturally close enough for Estonians, that they can identify themselves with Finnish things. Finnish culture sucked Estonians to its whirlwinds.
Though I’d say that there are ways in which Estonian culture is more European than Finnish, too. The Germanic influences have left some traces in Estonia. I’m Finnish, btw.
It might be, that Finns arrived from Estonia to Finland. Estonia was the bigger and wealthier neighbour for centuries, Tallinn was a hanseatic city (a Central European trading union). But when the climate in Finland started to get warmer in the 1500's, Finland started to grow bigger and stronger. Nowadays Finnish GDP is about 10 times bigger than the Estonian one.
