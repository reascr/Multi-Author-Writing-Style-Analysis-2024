>Jeffries is a mute member of the CPC, the largest caucus in the party, but has recently chosen to ally himself with its more conservative factions. And while the partyâ€™s moderate wing has moved left on everything from foreign policy to social welfare, Jeffries has not moved with it.
Neither will Jeffries. We need somebody who could plausibly talk to both halves of the party, but Jeffries has made his career out of attacking progressives.
The GOP play smarter politics than the Democrats - they play dirtier and the Democrats keep doing exactly what they want; hold the center. Why do you think they keep moving the goal posts?
"Moderate" (read conservative) Democrats are, at best out of touch and at worst actively against what the voting public wants and cares about. Actively ignoring this and saying that unity can only be done behind moderate leadership will only exacerbate the system that spawned Trump.
How has that been working for you? Honestly. Uniting behind the conservative wing of the Democratic party has been a failing move. Pushing Hilary as a candidate three times? Biden barely winning... losing the Supreme Court, electing people like Manchin and Sinema? Kind of feels like uniting behind the moderates isn't doing any good - it's a slow death.
