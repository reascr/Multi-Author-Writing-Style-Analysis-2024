You can buy them anywhere in the west without raising red flags -- suppliers like Digikey/Mouser, small hobbyist shops, ebay, etc.
We don't. Iran simply has to have someone in any western country buy them. From there, smuggling them into Iran (with Iran's help) would not be difficult at all.
Iran has been under sanctions for decades, this is just another thing they have been buying illegally. Now that America knows what parts Iran is sourcing for it's drones, it's possible to chase down said supply lines.
It seems to me this is more about the "embarrassment" of American items being found in Iranian drones. But AFAIK, Iran can fairly easily (and probably already is working to) replace American items in their supply chain with reasonably equivalent Chinese parts, or parts from other countries?
Iâ€™m sure there is a probably a much larger number of companies importing non medical products and then moving them into Iran.
The cost to the US / Western allies in administrating the sanctions must almost certainly be higher than the direct cost to the Iranians to buy elsewhere. I guess it's a signal that the US is opposed to an Iranian drone program, and it's hard to put a dollar amount on that... But whether it's for a domestic or foreign audience, it seems like this is all politics one way or another, from what I can tell.
But that's for more complex weaponry; my impression of many of these drones is that they're only moderately more complex than RC airplanes? Some models are literally off the shelf consumer models (I know not the ones talked about in this article, but it's an example of the level of tech needed to build a working drone.).
