The big problem here is that we don't value people with disabilities and it reflects in what we're willing to pay the selfless individuals who take care of them.
Working with special needs people should be a six figure job and yet we pay them as if they're the ones with special needs.
Why take on the emotional exhaustion, low pay, and legal risk to teach special needs when you could go elsewhere? We are leaching off teachers and assistants who genuinely love to help struggling kids - and that's the only reason we have the people we have today. It won't last. The UK is a preview for the US.
This is going to be a problem in the US. Pay is shit for teachers and more so for assistants. Teachers, unlike cops, can be held personally liable if they make a single mistake and the parents of special needs kids can have hair triggers for lawsuits.
Parents of special needs children often have hair triggers for lawsuits because our school districts have clearly demonstrated that a lawsuit is the only way to get a response.
