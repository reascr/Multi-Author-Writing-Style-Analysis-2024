You see, Iran and North Korea supplying us weapons is cool.... No global catastrophes. The west supplying Ukraine however will lead to global catastrophe.
West not sending enough weapons to Ukraine prior to Russian invasion has lead to a catastrophe. If Ukraine was NATO outpost armed to the teeth, Putin would be scared to invade like puppy.
They're not going to kill themselves and destroy Russia; they'll bide their time and try to take Ukraine again in the future.
If Russia actually thinks it is going to lose the war in Ukraine, this is the reality for the Russian elite. They will be ostracized from just about anywhere in the world where you can eat in a Michelin star restaurant, park a yacht, and stay in the presidential suite of a Four Seasons. They and their nation will be humiliated and isolated from the developed world’s economic system, which they have used to facilitate their theft of state resources and escape Russia to enjoy the freedom and democracy of Europe and North America. Their future will be one of poverty and isolation. They will not tolerate that.
The Earth will recover and there will be life again. Let’s hope if there are any humans who survive, they do a better fucking job protecting the only home we have in an infinitely vast, mostly dark and empty universe.
They will absolutely break all the toys and leave the sandbox if they can’t do what they want when they play in it.
