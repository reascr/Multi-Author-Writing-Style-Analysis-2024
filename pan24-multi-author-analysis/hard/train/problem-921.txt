I truly believe this is overstated. I think the truth of the matter is that when scared, half of people shut off their empathy and go into survival mode.
Some peoples perspective are just so entirely different to include the fact you mix in hate and fear and for good measure that people don’t like to admit they are wrong.
I’ve heard a few, to include immigration, abortion, excluding transsexual from military service, and distancing us from NATO but I can’t remember anymore right off the top of my head.

Ya. All other posters have this wrong. The comments are about how she’s being a hypocrite for being mad that he was mean to her. This is not what’s happening. She is calculating based on conservative media turning on Trump that they’re going to Mussolini his ass. It’s survival mode.
