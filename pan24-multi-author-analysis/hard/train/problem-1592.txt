Honestly? Assume that NYT, like most major institutions, has at least one or two people in it that are active supporters of what Russia is doing. This was likely not a case of incompetence, but intentional malice.
It's not really about "letting it happen." That's the whole point of clandestine operations; it's to act in ways that people specifically don't know about. Russia's broad, all-encompassing disinformation campaign in the West that's been going on since '97 couldn't have happened without active participation from at least some people within almost every single western media and news outlet. Realistically, most leadership in these organizations wouldn't have known about the problem until it was too late for them to do anything about it anyway -- at which point they'd either quit, get ousted, or stay quiet and collect a paycheck for staying quiet.
You know that Hanlon, whom you're quoting, was an optimist who simply refused to believe that people could be as awful as they actually are, right? Malice, unfortunately, tends to be the driving force in most things that negatively impact the human race.
Of course malice happens plenty, but so so often people fail to appreciate the complexity of doing just about anything in the modern world, and how many issues stem from that alone.
People usually overlook the fact that decisions are made in large organizations by a lot of people, each of whole see only part of the situation. When you look at the whole thing from the outside, things often look too stupid and obvious to be accidental, but it wasnâ€™t that way to the people making the mistake.
