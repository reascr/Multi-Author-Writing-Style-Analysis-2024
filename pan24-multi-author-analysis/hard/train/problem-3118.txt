Could they have maybe addressed something more pressing, like Missouri’s abysmal maternal mortality rate?
The argument was over the definition of a blazer made of ponte knit fabric. Ms. Kelley wanted it defined as a “cardigan” and not allowed under the existing dress code. Ponte knit is very commonly used for women’s suiting. Eventually they got her to add “cardigan” to the dress code so they could continue wearing their knit blazers.
That seems more important than whether a blazer made of knit fabric is considered a “blazer” or a “cardigan”.
The big issue was whether a ponte knit blazer was acceptable. That required the addition of “cardigan” into the wording, because Ms. Kelley refused to accept ponte knit as a suit fabric. Even though it is.
It is equal. I doubt anyone is arguing that it shouldn’t be. The argument was whether knit blazers counted as “blazers” or “cardigans.” The click-bait stuff about “bare arms” is nonsense, as women were required to have jackets or sweaters in the old dress code regardless.
Why is it distressing to you that the women’s dress code would become equivalent to the men’s dress code?
Of course, if you want to pass a better dress code, that doesn't mean you make women's more restrictive. It means you give men more options and let women keep what's working for them. My buddy should be allowed to wear a nice sweater instead of a full suit.
