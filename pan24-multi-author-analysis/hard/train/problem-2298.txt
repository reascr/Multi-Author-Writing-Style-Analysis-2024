"Both are bad" is the only justification when faced with the facts. It'd be nice if they took it a step further and realized the "bad" stuff they were told about Dems came from the actual bad party that lies. They'll admit Republicans lie, but not that they lie about the Democrats. Oh no...they are straight up 100% honest on that topic. Definitely.
IOW, they feel duped they got tricked by the Republicans but have too much pride to admit they've been wrong or that they are voting for reasons they don't want to admit (racism, hate, bigotry, sadism, fascism, authoritarianism, etc).
Various mentalities lead people to wear the brass collar, but whatever the reason, I doubt most understand how such a poor decision as voting Republican impacts their lives.
Same. Kasper Weinberg, James Baker, Edwin Meese, UGH! And it wasn't just Reagan's staff either—you can include his supporters in Congress. Strom Thurmond, Trent Lott, Jack Kemp, Tom Loeffler...relentless trash.
The man’s brain is a runaway fruit cart barreling down a hill. Walker has no impulse control. I really wonder if a large block of voters look at politics like it's a reality TV show and they’re doing it “for the lulz.”.
When they do political polls, they should ask "are you voting for this candidate solely because of their party affiliation?" How many voters that support Walker even know anything about him other than he's Republican?
Only 11% of GOP voters crossed party lines, that suggests that “they all” do not actually know how much of an idiot Walker is. Or if they do it shows that they don’t care because he has an R next to his name.
