Imagine if MTG became speaker - JFC - the press will probably leave Biden alone. Although I suspect the press will all be about how Biden will make peace with the GOP - cuz that's what they always end up doing - appealing to the grown-ups.
Only democrats have agency. Even funny is how we should give up our agenda in favor of theirs in the name of bipartisanship because ostensibly the people want that despite electing democrats.
I mean, the alternative is getting nothing done for the next two years, so... if the Democrats can build a coalition with a handful of moderate Republicans and elect a moderate Speaker who will support moderate Democratic bipartisan legislation, I'd say go for it.
Wishful thinking, the scenario I would like to see is the Democrats vote as a block for Hakeem Jeffries and the Republicans split their votes, and Jeffries becomes Speaker because some Republicans voted for him.
My modest hope is that, on the second ballot, Newhouse (a Republican Trump impeachment voter) wrangles four “moderate” GOP buddies and conspires with the Dems to elect himself Speaker. Even though Republicans would still control the House and Speakership, at least we’d finally move past the “Big Lie”.
