Not saying CS is totally neutral as to whether they benefit from having these accounts/clients, or that management fees in $19 billion will be negligible. But this is just sort of a status quo thing.
It ain’t all or even mostly going to be cash. Other assets are harder to leverage. Precious metals might be impossible unless they are EFTs based in metals. Other assets could be actual tangibles, in addition to shares. Not all shares (especially in the private banking world) are the kind traded on public exchanges that lend themselves to loaning out, and even then the customer has to consent. This level of customer would not be pressured to consent. The relationship is too valuable.
I don’t doubt the bank can make use of the cash that’s in there. But that’s going to be a small fraction of the assets being frozen.
What happens when you "freeze assets"? Does this mean that Credit Suisse is now gleefully holding $19B dollars and is making investments and collecting interest on that money? When it "unfreezes" do they owe the depositors interest payments?
