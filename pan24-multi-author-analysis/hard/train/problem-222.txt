Is he not concerned with power? Sure, he doesn't mean to take over the plantation, he doesn't challenge the master in the big house. But, power is what separates him from the slaves. It's what gives him his little stump.
Why, they might just lose their little stump. Equality? Ugh "I'm not one of those people. I shouldn't be working those fields".
If we don't have the power to turn our values into actual policy... what have we got? Other than the ability to tell ourselves "at least we're the good guys.".
It’s not just this though. My husband’s family excuses any and all behavior because “they support my policies”. So it doesn’t matter if they are adulterers, child molesters, corrupt beyond imagining as long as they continue to vote to morally police everyone else. You see this too within evangelical families. They will shun, judge others for what they love to call “sexual sins”, but if anyone they know does it, it’s either blissfully ignored or “well, Jesus knows their heart, so who are we to judge”.
