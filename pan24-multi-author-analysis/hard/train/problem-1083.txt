They could hardly have stated it more clearly if they'd painted themselves purple and danced naked on top of a harpsichord, singing 'We've just run out of rockets.'.
Yep. It kinda reminds me of when I have a bag of potato chips and its almost empty. I might just want a handful of chips but there is about 2 handfuls left in the bag. So I end up just finishing off the bag.
Also with all of their air defenses sending 1-2 out isnt a good idea since they can get picked off so they are forced to launch swarm attacks in hopes of over whelming their air defenses.
And you mentioned it being part of an IAD, the missile you fire with one of those systems cost orders of magnitude more than the drone they are shooting down. Even a Stinger is one order of magnitude more. That’s why people keep going back to gun system, but you need a shit ton of them to protect infrastructure.
Short range as in like 2km, and the can move at 45km/hr. It’s not a system use use to intercept incoming attacks, it’s a system you take with your armored columns to rip apart Soviet helicopters or keep around your base to shoot down anything that gets through the missile systems of your IAD.
This is why drone warfare is difficult to defend against: quantity has it’s own quality, and if it cost you more to shoot down than for them to send they win the economic exchange.
The more pressing problem is finding a mass-produced and reliable counter to cheap Iranian drones which (sometimes) do the same thing at a small fraction of the cost of a cruise missile, and shooting down which costs Ukraine far more than the drone. Probably a lot of truck-mounted machine-gun AAs, WW2-style.
