Can someone explain to me exactly what ilhan Omar said that was antisemetic? Is she wrong saying that it’s all about the Benjamin’s? She specifically referred to aipac, which is ran by a bunch of right wing Christian zionists (which by the way, the reason for Christian zionists supporting Israel is highly antisemitic in of itself).
It is a common conservative talking point to conflate criticism of Israel with criticism of Judaism as a whole, because that way they can paint opponents of Israel as antisemitic.
It was more the tweet that Israel had "hypnotized the world" that trafficked in antisemitic tropes of secret world domination, than the "all about the Benjamins" tweet.
in 2012, Representative Omar tweeted, “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” The word hypnotized has been used many times referring to Jewish people controlling the world.
