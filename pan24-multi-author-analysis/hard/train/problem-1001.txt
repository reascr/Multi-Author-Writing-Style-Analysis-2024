Then you have somebody like Ken Paxton who hires a team of lawyers to come in and immediately lay the groundwork for saying that their client is an attorney and a highly respected public official and the normal Bond conditions don't make any sense at all, why should he have to pee in a cup in front of a probation officer when he's just charged with fraud? And staying inside the county couldn't possibly work because he has to travel all the time for his job duties.
The wealthy don't get better outcomes because they get special treatment or because they bribe judges or whatever. They start from a position of privledge and have the ability to afford lawyers who can advocate for them, whereas people who don't have that tend to be worked through the system.
That bias is both due to how the system is structured (e.g., being able to afford bail or high-powered lawyers) as well as implicit (e.g., subconscious preferential treatment towards the wealthy at all levels of the justice system).
Edit: this provides an good read on how implicit biases impact the justice system (albeit centered around race rather than wealth).
This was another good read on socioeconomic bias that agrees with you that it tends to be more implicit:
I would argue that more explicit wealth bias exists in the system, but that is hard to prove from implici bias.
Is that due to a bias towards the wealthy, or the fact the wealthy have more resources than the poor to oppose those steps at every turn and cultivate their appearance to the court room? I would guess the latter, more often than not.
