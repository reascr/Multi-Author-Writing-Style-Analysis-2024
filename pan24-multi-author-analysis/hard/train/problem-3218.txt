Yea that’s incredibly fucked up. It’s blatantly showing the politicization of the highest court in the land, that’s expressly supposed to be non political/partisan. They’re rubbing our noses in it.
That’s part of the issue. USSC nominees were supposed to be bipartisan for their nomination by a majority vote, but the polarization has become so ridiculous over the past few decades that of course favors will be made behind closed doors. McConnell saying a judge can’t be nominated during an election year, then doing it is just one example. Also, the original comment I replied to was in regards to the Federalist Society. They fucking groom their picks. “I’ll get you a seat but you have to dissent whenever we want you to.” It’s all transactional and fucked up. Even Obama caved a bit with his nomination of Garland, a moderate conservative by today’s standards, and was shut down just because a president with a “D” nominated him.
Even Amy saying “glad to hear some noise that aren’t protestors outside my house,” referring to the applause she got and talking about her help to overturn Toe V Wade after (I believe?) stating it was already precedent during her hearings.
The issue is that our system of law and governance is predicated about precedent. About established rules, and upholding precedent so we can ensure that people are treated with at the least the facsimile of equality.
That's not precedent. That's just lying, or acting in bad faith. "It's settled law..." Left unsaid was "until the next opportunity to overturn it".
