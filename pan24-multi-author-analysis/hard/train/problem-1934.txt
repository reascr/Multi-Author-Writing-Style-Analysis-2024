It is a “crisis” when Democrats hold the presidency and it is an “opportunity” when Republicans hold the presidency.
They simply used the word “compromise” so republicans could save face. That was the compromise that was struck.
There is no compromise. The debt is over money we've already spent, now the bill has to be paid. That's it. You don't get to negotiate, you pay your bill.
You have to pay what you owe, yes. That doesn't imply that the debt ceiling must increase. It implies that some discretionary programs may go unfunded or under-funded because the money allotted to them in the budget is needed to pay other higher-priority obligations.
In actual fact the debt ceiling was exceeded the moment the government committed to make those payments without having the income to cover them—not when the bills came due.
There shouldn't be any question about the government paying its debts, but that is no excuse to keep spending money knowing that doing so will cause the debt ceiling to be exceeded. Pay prior obligations first, borrow up to (but not exceeding) the debt ceiling if necessary, and then divide the available resources among the various programs up to the authorized limits. Accept that this means some discretionary programs may not be fully funded if more money was authorized for them than is actually available after debt service and basic essentials are accounted for.
It is the President's job as Chief Executive to take into account not only whether spending on some program has been approved but also whether the government can afford the expense. Paying debts already incurred should always have first priority, short of an existential threat. However, this intolerance for default is not an excuse to keep spending and incurring new debt which will inevitably cause the debt ceiling to be exceeded.
“responsible debt limit increase” is a bullshit collection of words. You have to pay what you owe. Responsible budget makes sense. McCarthy is an ass.
