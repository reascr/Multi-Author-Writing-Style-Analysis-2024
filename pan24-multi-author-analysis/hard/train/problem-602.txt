Exactly. China has a demographic time bomb. They wont be a threat forever. Without Russia’s support, they wont take Taiwan.
By destroying Russia’s military in Ukraine, the US could drop its defense budget to 400 billion a year and still maintain enough of a presence after asking allies around the world to step up monitoring the flow of goods.
Also, we're defanging a major geopolitical rival with no troops on the ground for a fraction of what a full blown US/Russian war would cost (even if you somehow kept the nukes shelved). We're gathering intelligence on every action Russia takes as well as what weapons of ours are most effective against them.
Even before the lend-lease kicks in and Ukraine starts paying us back, I'd say that it's money well spent.
Also, no amount of money we spend is in any way comparable to the price of not doing anything as Russia takes over Ukraine.
Secondly, those expenses would be there regardless or not if we give it to ukraine. Besides the purchase cost, stockpiles of Equipment cost money to store and even dispose/dismantle.
And that’s without putting a single American life at risk or effort on gathering intel on enemy and simulations. Add to that the fact ukraine is now in billions in debt to us, it’s weakening Russia, power projection, free advertising for NATO/US weapons, etc.
It doesn’t matter, because the benefit of weakening Russia and sending a warning message to anybody trying to upset the world order far outweighs the cost, which is a drop in the bucket for the US. 50 billion dollars is pocket change for America.
