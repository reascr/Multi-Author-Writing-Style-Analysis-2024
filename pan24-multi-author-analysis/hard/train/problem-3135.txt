I think your misconception is because you imagine that the universe has a central point it's expanding away from, sort of like the way a firecracker begins at a point then explodes outward from that central point. But that's NOT how the universe expands.
Anyway, I think time didn't start at the big bang. I think something must have existed before. But what existed before? Well, the simplest thought would be that whatever existed before the big bang must have been capable of producing the conditions for the big bang. Simple enough right? Makes sense?
If the ultimate fate of our universe is that nothing ever happens again, then why didn't this happen prior to the big bang? Whatever existed before, if it follows the same laws of physics, should be subject to the same natural and cosmological laws. But whatever happened before the big bang resulted in conditions that caused the big bang, so entropy was not the ultimate fate of whatever existed before.
So, assuming the laws of physics are indeed consistent pre-big bang and post-big bang, then we can take a pretty big guess that, if entropy was not the ultimate fate of what existed before, maybe entropy is not the ultimate fate of our universe either. But how is this possible when the evidence is mounting that we have an expanding universe?
This makes me wonder if the heavier elements in our universe have then also been around longer (and in greater abundance) than we thought. Because if massive galaxies were around so soon that suggests supernovas were also going off a lot earlier than we thought, which means more time for heavy elements to form.
