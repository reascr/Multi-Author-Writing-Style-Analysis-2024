Also, that article using silver certificates as an example of "default" sure is stretching what is means to default. The debt was still valid, it just wasn't redeemable in silver. It's extremely misleading. Actually, so is 4. The debt was still valid, it just couldn't be converted to gold. Changing how debt is payed back (or redeemed) isn't defaulting.
Defaulting on relatively very small portions of debt (like gold bonds or silver certificates) is extremely different from defaulting on all debt. And that article really stretches the meaning of "default" (not to mention getting it wrong about silver certificates) and was written by a contributor to the Federalist Society, so I'd take it with a very tiny grain of salt. It's very clearly written to give the misleading impression that the idea of the US never defaulting isn't true and what could happen later this year is just the same (it's not).
No it hasn't. The US has never hit the debt ceiling. Under Obama they came really close, and even just that caused the credit agencies to lower the US's credit rating.
We came close to it this last time and got our credit rating downgraded. But this time around, I think the people involved might just be crazy enough to add a 5th to the list.
