And Russia didn't have plane to plane missile technology till one of ours got caught in the fuselage of a Russian mig, they landed and reversed engineered it.
We didn't really know what mig 25s we're outside that they had a weird design and were fast until a Russian pilot defected and landed at a random airfield in Japan.
Sorry, I found it on a rabbit hole vid watching session which probably started when watching something from Real Engineering on youtube.
Then we wasted an absolute ass ton of it bc nobody had really used pure titanium in production environments, so we basically had to learn/develop a whole new production and machining process for it. ...and now you can go buy a titanium camping spork or carabiner for like $5.
I'm pretty sure we were only able to make SR-71s bc we used a ton of back channels to buy titanium from the USSR. As in the USSR had the best source and mining capabilities for it at the time, so we did some crazy shit like have a shell company in x country buy it from the USSR, sell to another shell company in country y, who sold it to another shell company in country z, who sold it to us.
