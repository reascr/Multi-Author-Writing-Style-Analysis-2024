Can someone summarize what is the situation in Kosovo? The article more or less describes how the “match was lit”, but I don’t really understand how or why Serbs and Albanians hate each other.
My guy, no Serb is killing albanians in 2023, but a lot of Serbs in kosovo are getting terrorised by albanians because of historic ethnic tensions. You are being brainwashed just now in this sub.
To answer briefly, Kosovo was a part of Serbia for the past 700 years or so and then the albanians managed to take it with the support from America.
- The reason that caused Serbs to start not liking Albanians is that when the Ottomans conquered the balkans, the Albanians switched sides and became Muslim (mostly). The Ottomans decided to expel as many Serbs as possible from the Serbian heartland and settle the area with Albanians.
They expelled the majority of the Kosovo Serb population after the Serbian Army pulled out following the NATO air campaign. By that point, they were no longer the smaller army. They were unopposed.
