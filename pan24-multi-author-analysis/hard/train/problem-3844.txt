Exactly. The point isn't to have Taiwan win, but to make taking it so costly and unfruitful that China cannot afford to invade and/or occupy long term.
For something like this USA to Taiwan sale to help prevent Chinese incursion, I can see a lot of reasons for why this is normal and legimate (perhaps because I'm on the USA side of that issue).
Yes, the most dangerous thing Taiwan and the US have done for world peace is allowing Taiwan to start falling dangerously behind China militarily. Not that the Taiwan military can go toe to toe with China, but from what I've read over the last 10 years it seems as though even the asymmetric deterrent capabilities of Taiwan have been falling behind. Hopefully Ukraine is the wake up call both the US and Taiwan need.
Taiwan needs to do a lot better than that. They should think about how to be more like ukraine, or other US allies around the world able to defend themselves for a credible period of time mainly on their own.
That way, even relief is delayed by unforseen future circumstances, Taiwan is not overrun. That way, China does not plan to create such circumstances imagining that if it sets it up just right it can win a short war.
