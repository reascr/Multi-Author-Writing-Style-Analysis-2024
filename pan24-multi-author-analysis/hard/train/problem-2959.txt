Dolly you're the best! The beatings of some of the workers at the power plant is a bad situation. I can't wait for the day when the terrorists leave that plant once and for all.
So interesting! They're so brave. That one doctor who said they tell a lot of jokes to get through it, he seems like he'd be a great drinking buddy. That one soldier holding the bullet is one lucky man. Thanks for posting this.
Thanks for sharing this. It's crazy how close they got, and a critically heroic defense by Ukraine's National Guard and others.
A Ukrainian soldier once remarked they'd fight with sticks and stones if they must, but it seems Russians are racing to get there first.
Considering the power imbalance between Ukraine and Russia, I can understand the hyperbole. But if I was going to be more specific, I'd say the Russian state terrorists are more caught and being slowly ground.
Think of it like a manufacturing accident. "Crushed" implies immediate, grievous injury most likely resulting in death. "Caught and ground down" implies a low, possibly non-lethal outcome. If Russia was being crushed, this war would be over. But Russia is instead throwing their military at entrenched and highly experience Ukrainian forces, grinding down their military capabilities.
So, instead of helping Ukraine win, and stopping Russia alltogether, and making sure that there will never be a "future" fight with Russia, US is holding back, while readying to "fight" with Russia.
They can give Ukraine what it needs, now, and save countless lives, and international order, or risk it all, and pay later in a bigger war.
