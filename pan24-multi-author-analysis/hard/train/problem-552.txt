I can appreciate the absolute balls and bravery it took to martyr yourself for a freer Russia. But it is unfortunately in vain. The Russian people are not ready for change yet (even more independent polls show a majority still support both Putin and the war), but hopefully this war speeds that process along.
And you are so right in that second paragraph. Leaders due tend to opt for war as a way to regain support. There had to be something going on for Putin to not be satisfied with "just" taking Crimea and part of the Donbas.
I will say what he is doing has become somewhat overshadowed by the war. While we all knew how Russia treats dissidents, it was still a huge message for him to willingly be arrested and show the world what they're capable of, and very publicly.
Oh ye, who is oh so learned in the ways of Russian opposition and totally not a troll, who do you suggest _is_ a fine example of Russian opposition then?
Many Russians, powerful ones too dislike Putin, but disagreeing with his methods doesn't mean they disagree with his goals.
