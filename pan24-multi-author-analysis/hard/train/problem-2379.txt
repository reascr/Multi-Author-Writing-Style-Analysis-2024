The gay wedding cake issue came down to the state authorities mishandling the case, not the underlying issues related to the cake.
Not really, because a gay wedding cake probably doesn't differ at all from a straight wedding cake, so it's not an issue of putting any sort of content on the cake that would qualify as speech that's objectionable to the baker. At least with a website, you can tell by looking at it that it's for a gay couple if there are photos of the couple.
I personally didn't have a topper on my wedding cake, so I don't feel like it's a necessity. If that's really the sticking point, then I'm fine with the baker refusing to put two brides or two grooms on top. I'm pretty sure people would be fine with buying their own topper and putting it on themselves. It probably costs a few bucks on Amazon to get one.
What they probably can't do themselves is make a three-tier cake with pretty flower decorations made of icing. That's typically the main service being requested from a baker for a wedding regardless of sexual orientation. Nobody who requests that is asking for anything that anybody would consider to be objectionable creative expression.
No, and they're not compelling anybody. The website designer in the case you're talking about hasn't been compelled to make a website for a gay couple because she doesn't offer wedding websites as a service. She could continue doing that and nobody will ever force her to make a wedding website for a gay couple.
Should the government compel someone to create a website for a gay couple when it goes against the website designers religious beliefs? Creating something is speech in itself. So compelling someone to create something is compelling someone to speech.
