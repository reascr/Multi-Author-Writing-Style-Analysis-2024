Something we talked about in my climate change & sustainability course today is thermal expansion playing just as much a role as ice melt when it comes to sea level rise.
The Greenland ice sheet, one of the coldest and most remote regions of the world that serves a pivotal role in the Earth's climate, is now clearly feeling significant effects of climate change. Researchers found that central and northern areas of the sheet have recently seen the hottest temperatures in a millennium.
It has been long clear that many parts of Greenland are warming, but the latest research, published in Nature on Wednesday, took a deeper look at the central part of Greenland's ice sheet, where the impact of climate change has long been unclear.
To learn more about that impact, researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research drilled ice cores to create a "high-quality reconstruction" of temperatures in central and north Greenland from 1,000 AD to 2011. With that data, it became clear: Not even some of the coldest, most remote and highly-elevated areas of the world can escape the impacts of global warming.
Aside from complications in determining climate from the deepest cores, it's important to keep in mind that while man made global warming is real, the era of humans has occurred in an interglacial period that's been relatively colder than in the past. The last "hot house" period happened before humans existed (several million years ago) and saw a consistent decline in temperatures until the current day where they are suddenly and rapidly increasing. Due to this man made increase, it's unlikely that humans will ever see another ice age again.
We are technically still well inside an ice age. It's been going for 2.6 million years or so. That ice age is why there's still so much ice. While it is warmer inter-glacial period, all the ice means ice age. In terms of geological timescales, the amount of time ice covering continents and poles is roughly around zero.
