The best part of authoritarians is they end up believing their own lies. Which pairs nicely with "Never interrupt your enemy while he is busy making a mistake.".
Yeaaah. Since the war in Ukraine began, I've seriously started to wonder how many of their nukes are even functional let alone have a reliable vehicle for delivery.
That was a big reason but it is my understanding the much bigger issue is the cheap Chinese tires they use for all of their vehicles. Tires which aren't rated anywhere near the necessary standards to support the weight they were expected to carry.
It's such a tossup these days. It's really hard to say anymore. I left Ukraine out because I simply don't think they have the capacity to beat any of those I listed on their own merits. They're repelling a Russian invasion with huge support from NATO, sure. But on their own, their nation and military just aren't that great. Repelling an invasion with international support and winning a conventional war on your own are two entirely different things. Lastly, and very much importantly, nukes.
