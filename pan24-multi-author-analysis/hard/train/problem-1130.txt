Ok not crazy if you strictly limit your news and media consumption to one source only and willfully tune out the vast variety of extra data points and platforms debunking the Fox News lies. But sure its not crazy that a crazy person that only listens to one source completely beleives only that source that retracted their own lies.
You might argue it’s crazy to believe that all media but this one specific media outlet is lying, but that’s what manny people believe. More often than not, these people operate on faith — hence their religious disposition. They don’t need facts because they have faith.
This isn’t surprising because you want your delegates to be the most devoted individuals from your party. It just so happens that for Republicans, that also means your most crazy party members.
This was a republican, who got caught. The only thing this shows is that our election integrity is fine as is since we’re catching voter fraud when it does happen. The right fails to mention that most of the voter fraud have been republicans thinking they could get away with it since President Cheeto keeps saying it’s so rampant and easy to do to his base.
For the last 2 election cycles the vast majority of voter fraud has been small numbers of republican individuals thinking it’s easy to cheat because they hear so much about democrats cheating.
