Just checked our guidelines are you’re correct, there is no intermediary fees for banks in PSD (replaced by PSD2) Which is ofc an EU directive. Otherwise payments outside PSD jurisdiction may be subject to the following:
As someone who works at a bank, there absolutely usually is a fee to transfer money between banks internationally - in the UK it’s typically £25. You’re mistaking it for a card payment where typically its down to how you choose to have the exchange rate worked out (i.e by the merchant or your bank) but other than an exchange fee of a couple quid, there’s no real fee for transacting internationally. Some banks even offer no fee for transactions in certain areas (e.g I think Monzo allows for no fees in Europe, Starling is the same for US?).
Great. So any ambassadors who get called to Turkey to talk about this, simply start out with “Russia is doing this, you know this, we don’t have anything to talk about.“.
If I were Turkish I'd be embarrassed, but I know enough Turkish people to know most are going to just double down or disregard. Religious ire seems to fill the void Erdogan left in their wallets.
