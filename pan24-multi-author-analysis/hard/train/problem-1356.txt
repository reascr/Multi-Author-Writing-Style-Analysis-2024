It'd be neat if he riled them up even more, that way they can't like, try to pretend they weren't going on about prosecuting a well-meaning doctor for no reason.
Redpillers were making their way towards "Americans first" legislature to try to pull troops out of the M.E., but Biden being the guy to actually do it made him the guy who makes America look cowardly.
He probably caused the pandemic by advocating for masks which scared people and made them breathe harder which spread the virus quicker, even though it's not airborne OR dangerous, of course.
At the very beginning of the pandemic, when they said we needed cloth masks, my first reaction was that will do literally nothing to stop airborne particles. But within a very short span of time, I was wearing a cloth mask, because even decreasing the chance of getting covid by just a few percentage points was worth it when the alternative was ending up on a ventilator. I think many of these idiots don't make the risk/reward connection and just see someone, that they don't see as a authority figure, telling them what to do. So basically 5 year olds.
