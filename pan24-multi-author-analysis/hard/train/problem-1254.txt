China will attack when China is ready to attack. That's years in the future by even the most terrifying professional estimates.
Geopolitics moves really slowly most of the time. These people have waited most of a century, they are not in a rush. Don't get too caught up in all the young people being excited about something actually geopolitically exciting happening for the first time in their lives (Russo-Ukrainian War) and expecting that to be a new normal or something.
It's slow and boring, just like usual. If China doesn't launch its attack for another 20 years, I honestly wouldn't be that surprised.
I mean China doesn't need to attack now. We are basically taking away Taiwan's strategic resource advantage with the CHIPS act. Taiwan will have to always be on the cutting edge of semi-conductors or that strategic resource necessity of the world will start to dwindle. People pay more attention to something that affects themselves than if inaction does not sadly. China in the future could economically starve Taiwan and then with combination of Taiwan friendly policies and tactics like bribery to eventually get the leadership of Taiwan to support reunification. The question is the resolve and willpower or such leaders of Taiwan to not be susceptible.
it really depends on what China wants to gain from taking over Taiwan. At the very ideological level, a war would be to end the civil war ongoing from 1927. The end goal would be to wipe out the remnants of the RoC government. To that end, they could accomplish this by wiping out the entire population on the island. They don't have to invade until afterwards.
