I have a serious question. Trandgender people don’t feel comfortable using the bathroom that corresponds to their biological sex, so advocates say that they should be able to use the bathroom of their choice. If biological women don’t feel comfortable sharing the bathroom why are their concerns not valid? If anything why not make a third bathroom for trans students?
Trans people want to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. If they have not had gender reassignment surgery, then I also understand why woman would not want to have someone with a penis in the bathroom with them. Now I personally think it's silly because no one's looking at genitals in restrooms. But and I mean this is the nicest way possible, but why are the concerns of cis people discounted? Trans people don't want to use the restroom of their birth gender, because that makes them uncomfortable. But if cis people are uncomfortable with someone who still has the opposite genitalia in their bathroom they shouldn't be listened to as well?
This way you could know that you wouldn’t have any trans people sharing your restroom, while also not imposing your fears about the diarrhea thing on other people.
Your solution also puts an open target on trans people who then have to out themselves any time they want to use the restroom which can be dangerous.
I think any state that issues trans bathroom bans should be legally required to have an alternative bathroom trans people can use. Single stalls, teachers restrooms. I think that is a happy medium and both sides can feel comfortable. And before anyone says well that's not right, the bathroom issue is a distractive talking point. My idea addresses it, and makes it stop being one.
