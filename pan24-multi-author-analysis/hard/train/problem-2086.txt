I mean, if you look at how effective Biden has been with extremely slim majorities, it does seem that older leaders may have extra abilities for legislation.
We also have to think about the potential Biden could pass away in office (he is in his 80s so this isn't alarmist shit-talk) and no fucking way is President Harris going to be able to get elected in her own right.
An a liberal Democrat understanding that Biden had a 50-50 Senate tie (with Harris breaking), Manchin and Sinema sandbagging him, and only a few seat lead in the house he got...
It would be quite something but really not all that shocking if Biden managed to gather votes from Republican House members to keep things moving (at least avoid likely shutdowns). The GOP is doing some soul searching right now, and a few might just sober up and realize that governing effectively has a positive effect on approval.
We all had a pretty strong consensus, he's doing a great job. Nothing revolutionary, but he's also acting as a moderate within the party, meaning he's pulling the centrists further left. "Sassy Joe" is what my sis-in-law called him, and he totally is.
