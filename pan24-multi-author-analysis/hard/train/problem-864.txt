Musk’s actions since closing the deal last year have illuminated how he sees the balance internet platforms must strike in protecting free expression versus user safety. While he’s lifted restrictions on many previously suspended accounts including former President Donald Trump’s, he’s also placed new limitations on journalists’ and others’ accounts for posting publicly available flight information that he equated to doxxing.
“The question of free speech is always more complicated than it looks,” said David Brody, managing attorney of the Digital Justice Initiative at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law. “There’s a freedom to speak freely. But there’s also the freedom to be free from harassment, to be free from discrimination.”.
That's actually not true, it's considered hate speech and it's not protected. If you fully read what the first amendment says and its expanded legal definition, it basically outlines that racism isnt protected in free speech. Real fucking weird that you even tried to do that...there are tons of legal phrases that cant be said that come with repercussions, you're analyzation of free speech is based off of the concepts the words themselves have seperately, but the legal concept of "free speech" is a lot different. My next question is why do you think hate speech should be protected, weirdo?
I don't agree with "hate speech" or racism but criminalizing those sorts of things has the opposite of the desired effect.
Because the government doesn't do a good job of defining speech in such a way that hate speech only includes "bad" things. Nice speech doesn't need protection.
