he make his choice to fight for his country with his people as sacrifice so he can say "Ukraine still fighting" and also take massive debt from all the weaponry that ensure none of the future Ukrainian children have any future but work to pay that debt.
That's one scenario but it's not happening right now. The smart move is to just say Ukraine now belong to US/Germany which make them NATO region right away. But no, his ego is too high for Ukraine and he want to keep fighting sacrificing millions of his people and future.
It is better to support Ukraine against an unprovoked invasion and genocidal occupation. Allowing Russia to take what it wants is a dangerous and appeasing precedent. Russia can end this whenever they want by leaving Ukraine, yet it's somehow Ukraine's fault Russia is continuing to attack them?
Russia effectively had parts them for eight years and Ukraine could do nothing about it, and Russia occupies Crimea as well. None of that stopped Russia from wanting more and claiming to annex Kharkiv, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia now. Giving Russia an inch was not going to stop them from trying to take a mile.
Although I don’t think the Russians should be let off the hook entirely. They had a chance at changing, although I think the cards were always stacked against that. It’s all their particular context, as opposed to say the PRC that has never been democratic. Those people truly have no control.
