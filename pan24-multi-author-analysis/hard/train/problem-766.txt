Basically the article centers around reports from Vadym Skibitsky, who is Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief, and Andriy Chernyak, who is a Ukrainian Military Intelligence Service representative.
Until Ukraine & Zelenskyy are shown to be repeatedly telling harmful lies to the West that are demonstrably false at anywhere near the level of Russia & Putin, in both subject and quantity, it's very misleading to suggest that Ukraine and Russia should be treated similarly as information sources.
I also don't agree with the framing or implication that both Russia and Ukraine are equally as untrustworthy, or that information from either side should be dismissed equally as false propaganda just because they are on opposing sides of a war.
So, unfortunately I think Russian patriotism and propaganda will be stronger than any audible dissention, left in the country.
Maybe if these (ethnic Russian) new conscripts, from bigger cities are forced into bad situations, sentiments in Russia can change politically around Putin.
None of that is guaranteed to lead to Putinâ€™s downfall, but the possibility of it increases as this war drags on and he brings more troops into it.
What they're claiming is that Russia plans to mobilize 500k troops for a spring offensive and what they believe is that if that offensive fails, it will lead to the downfall of Putin.
The Ukrainian military is warning that Putin is planning to mobilize up to half a million new troops in preparation for a new offensive in Ukraine.

Russia plans to mobilize 500,000 soldiers in days. If they don't deliver victory, then 'Putin will collapse,' says Ukrainian spy chief.
"If Russia loses this time around, then Putin will collapse," said Ukraine's deputy military intelligence chief.
