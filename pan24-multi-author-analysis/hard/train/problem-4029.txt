That's Putinist nonsense. Letting Ukraine fall might be easier in the short term and dealing with Russia might even beneficial for a completely cynical USA.
Putin's fanbois like to spin the Ukraine war as something machinated by the USA to "weaken Russia" because Russia would have been a rival from the outset... it made itself the rival by invading neighbours.
what do you mean where did I say it wasn't the right case to help Ukraine, I am saying the US is motivated to see Russia army weakened and is one of the core reasons why they are supporting Ukraine.
Literally, the reason the US is arming Ukraine is that it is an amazing deal for America they get to say they are defending democracy and simultaneously military crippling a rival without having to fight them for a few billion dollars, Geopolitically speaking, it is a wet dream for the US.
I’m glad Germany is helping Ukraine, and I’m glad they’re no longer using Russian natural gas, but they would’ve been in a much better predicament had they heeded warnings from the US & UK about Russia’s plans that had been handed to them for years. Now they have the gall to complain (private) US Natural gas sellers are up-charging them.
Germany is repeating the same course of action it did with Russia. Ignore all of your allies’ concerns and warnings about a country, allow said country to invest into integral parts of your economy, and then act surprised when every single thing you’ve been told for years comes true.
Not to mention the political pressure they place on their allies and other countries over which they have influence, when this can lead to economic payoff for the US.
