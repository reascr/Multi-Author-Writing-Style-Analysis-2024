Contrary to what a lot of people think, being a stupid asshole is not good publicity. Ask peta and greenpeace how much of a shit anybody gives about either of them after all their nonsense.
Its not that they're destroying anything (so far), it's that they're being insufferable ass-clowns and making people think climate activists are a bunch of fucking vandalizing morons who are doing this for attention to themselves, rather than attention to the issue they claim to care about.
This is low-effort, low-stakes tomfuckery which, to be fair, does get attention but it only makes climate change activists look like overpriviledged fuckwits with too much time on their hands and not enough drive to do something actually meaningful.
Instead they're sanctimonious assholes doing stupid stunts that drive people away from climate activism, ensuring the fossil fuel stranglehold holds for a little longer.
If the actions of some random climate activists change your mind about climate change, your ideological integrity is about as rigid as a wet napkin.
Maybe if your audience is a bunch of morons without the capacity for careful examination of complex issues.
