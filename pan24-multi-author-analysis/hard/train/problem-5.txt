Thanks for the info. Iâ€™m not suggesting we unnecessarily poke the bear. At the current rate of the conflict, Russia appears overextended and all Ukraine/NATO needs to do is defend.
If there's a conventional war with Russia there is no discussion. It's over before it even started. Since nukes are a thing there will never be one, and that's how it's going to go until the nukes don't exist.
yes man because us using nukes against a ww2 power with zero nukes is the same as us using nukes against a modern power with one of the largest arsenals in the world.
If it's a single nuclear weapon and not thousands of nukes, I can imagine that it would have the rest of the world launch a conventional invasion of Russia.
Nukes will be met with nukes. Why? Because if nukes are launched then "nukes are on the table" and the tactic that has the highest chance to succeed in preventing more launches is to hit the launch sites and the best weapon to hit the launch sites are nukes due to their large blast radius.
Why would you use conventional weapons that may not obliterate a launch site and risk more incoming nukes when the enemies willingness to use nukes automatically gives you the green light to use your own?
In other words, nukes are the weapon with the highest probability to hit and destroy a target launched from hundreds or thousands of miles away, so if you want to prevent more nukes being launched at you, you have to launch nukes to ensure that you hit the enemy launch sites and missile silos.
NATO would hopefully not retaliate by nuking Russian cities, but rather they would strike nuclear launch sites to prevent more nukes from launching, followed by an invasion by conventional land forces of several countries. I mean, that's what I'd think would happen.
