We all know that, but his “my pronouns are prosecute/Fauci” is some next level fucking laziness. At this rate he’ll be tweeting “build the wall”, “lock her up” and “NFL players can’t kneel” in no time. The dude can’t even evolve the troll.
I could be wrong, but I believe he has a trans daughter. Can you even fathom the emotional and intellectual bankruptcy this idiot has that he can drop such hateful shit. And we’re past the point of joking. He knows this translates to violence, unless he’s impossibly thick. Maybe he is. Maybe he’s that stupid.
You’re right of course. Apologies. I hope prosecute finds prosecutes way so prosecute doesn’t keep wasting space with prosecutes uninspired, intellectually bankrupt shit.
I’ll join you in the armchair psychology. I wonder if he gets a kick knowing that she’ll read his crap because he knows everything he says at this stage will be spread across every news site in existence? What a man.
He really is. I had no idea until he purchased Twitter, honestly. I had always thought of him as a planetary activist based on nothing more than owning Tesla. How informed I’ve become in the last 6 or 7 months. Wanting an EV myself, I would never purchase a Tesla.
Does this guy know who buys Tesla’s? It’s fascinating watching him alienate his entire customer base, lol. Guess who won’t be buying another Tesla ever again?
Second, Tesla announced that they're going camera-only a few months ago. Not sure when that transition is set to happen, but it's going to be worse. It's very easy to confuse a camera (for example, by getting dirt on the lens).
