Without an open land route to Sweden to divert Swedish forces, a sea invasion of Gotland would most likely fail. Sweden is safe anyhow as Russia would need to go through Finland or Norway. Both are either in or about to join NATO so that is a no go.
A vast majority wants to join NATO. However, it's a tricky situation. Paludan, a danish-swedish troll, burnt a Quran, which pissed off a lot of Turks and started burning the Swedish flag in response. Here's the thing. We have freedom of speech, and we can't prosecute someone expressing their beliefs within our borders, no matter how stupid they are.
Turkey is a dictatorship. For crying out loud, there's been moments when Erdogan has reminded the people that he is immortal, a simple trick done by dictators. They have zero sanctions on Russia as well. This is a massive win for oppression of democracy, win for both Turkey and Russia if Sweden can't join.
However, Erdogan and 'unfortunately' Turkish people right now, do not understand this concept of freedom of speech. If they did, they would've burnt pictures of the dude responsible, not the flag of the nation allowing for people to express what they want.
