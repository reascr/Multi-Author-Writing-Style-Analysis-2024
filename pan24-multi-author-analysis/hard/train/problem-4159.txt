Navigating a crisis well would have likely have given him a boost in the polls, as well as creating a national unity around tackling the problem. It was an easy chance to display non-partisan leadership. The fact he didn't do any of the above very well is likely why the polls were fairly accurate within the margin of error either way; he didn't gain any support, and he may have shed support or motivated opposition support. Who knows for sure?
I doubt it. The difference in this study was 10 points, or 55% republicans to 45% democrats. That means of 50,000 people who died, 27,500 would have been Republicans and 22,500 would have been democrats.
It certainly doesn’t help the right, but Covid deaths aren’t the thing that’s going to save democrats. It’s just a tragic, stupid loss of human life that these people would rather be proudly ignorant rather than protect themselves and their families with a simple little needle.
That said, I agree it's a tragic stupid loss of human life, but it's definitely having a wide variety of consequences.
