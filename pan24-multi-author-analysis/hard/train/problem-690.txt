I think it's a variety of reasons. First, accumulating wealth is evidence of your success. Second, a corporation is there to maximize profits (i.e. increase stock price) for the shareholders so a CEO is restricted by that -- he would have to show that increasing wages will increase profits. Third, donating to charity brings more status than paying your workers a little more. Fourth, they probably see donating to charity as more useful because it goes to help those most in need in a way that the donor feels most align with their vision.
OK? But The Gates Foundation does great charity work. You make it sound bad that they are donating their money to a good charity just because it's their own charity.
Why wouldn't you donate to your own charity if you know everyone running it and you agree with the mission?
That’s why you have “charities” like the Clinton Foundation or whatever. You can say “we are donating 50 million dollars”, but you’re just reinvesting your own money back into your own company. Lol.
If Bezos actually wanted to be generous with his fortune, he’d be out there paying off medical debt, making low income housing or co-ops, paying for lawyers for people being fucked over by the cops and sending kids to college:
It's all BS and these billionaires are mostly psychopaths who will shit on the little man and keep these workers down, case and point Bezos the cretin gives 0 fucks about the workers that enrich him.
