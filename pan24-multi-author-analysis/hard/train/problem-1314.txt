There are 30 NATO countries, all with the same power to make demands, only Turkey and to a lesser extend Hungary is doing this.
Only thing that matters is strenh, and Turkey is probably 5th strongest in NATO, soon to be 6th if Germany gets its shit together.
Uh not when you look at the numbers on the ground, Turkey has the 2nd largest army in NATO and beats Sweden and Finland combined for personal and budget...
and I want Sweden and Finland to get in same as you, but reading all these post about kicking out Turkey out and how Turkey isn't as valuable as them is annoying, when Turkey is a huge contributor to NATO and its the main reason why they get to play the game they're playing right now.
Both statements can be true at the same time, that Sweden and Finland would be better members than Turkey, and that it's stupid to even suggest kicking Turkey out.
But if Finland and Sweden would be "better" members than Turkey is a hypothetical and different question.
Just to be clear, I don't support what Turkey is doing right now either and I hope that things can get sorted quickly so Sweden and Finland get the OK.
