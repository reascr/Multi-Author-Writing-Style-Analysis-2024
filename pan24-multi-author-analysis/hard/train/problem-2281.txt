Because they canâ€™t let a Democrat have any wins to campaign on. They have to work toward a narrative that Democrats are ineffective and freeloading off government because how else are they going to convince their base that Democrats are ineffective and freeloading off taxpayers?
And they are funding all of this grotesque wastefulness with our tax dollars, because Republican voters are terrible, spiteful people who want the nation to suffer.
Just to play devil's advocate here, it's not such a bad thing to be having these right wing GOPers wasting their time chasing after bullshit instead of spending it drafting legislation that would further erode the rights and safety of regular Americans.
They could pass legislation, there are things this nation would benefit from that is not part of any liberal/moderate/conservative ideology but one side simply will not work with the other to accomplish it and always seems to go far out of the way to obstruct these very common sense things simply because the other side proposed it. I would list examples but even my short list is too long to list here.
Just look who tries to work in a bipartisan fashion. look who tries to compromise. Hint, it's isn't the GOP.
