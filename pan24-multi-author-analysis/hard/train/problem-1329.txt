She saw Oz as possibly winning and wanted to disassociate herself. Has nothing to do with helping democracy. Oprah is and has always been all about her brand.
I get where you're coming from and am no Oprah fan but honestly I can see people who like her being swayed.
Sigh... Oprah, like Obama is ulimatily a conservative. Both are very well spoken and everything, but still conservatives. In the old days I would have thought of them as liberal Republicans., which used to be a thing. Until they all changed after Carter, and Democratics became the party of right leaning conservatives I hardly recognize led by Bill. Everyone seems to think that the difference between being a liberal and a conservative has to do with whether you support Woe vs Wade or the Christian right. It is really all about whether you support economic policies that leave no one behind or you don't. Oprah is filty rich and supports very conservative economics policies and conservative personalities who think and travel in the same circle as her. This doesn't make her a bad person just not very economically intelligent, unless it is about how to make more money, which is easy when you're rich. There is an entire huge industry in America devoted to advisers who will tell you that it takes money, to make money and how to stay rich. Ask Oprah she owns eight homes.
