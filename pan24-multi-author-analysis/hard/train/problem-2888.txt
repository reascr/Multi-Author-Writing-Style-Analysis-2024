It still amazes me that after a doctor gave him a dementia test while he was president, in which he had to identify that a drawing of an animal with a hump was a camel and that a drawing of an animal with a long neck was a giraffe, trump subsequently went on TV to brag about how he had been able to correctly name the animals.
trump did not create a new political philosophy. He read about Hitler and the Nazis and liked it. The GOP was embracing fascism long before trump became the party leader.
How was Donald trump a fascist. You guys love using that buzzword even tho you are the literal fascist, trying to silence people you don’t agree with; the cancel culture as a whole is fascist.
Cuz he incited that “riot”. so are the governors and mayors who let the blm and antifa (ironic) run rampid through their cities for weeks fascist? I never said anyone was silencing me, and it has nothing to do with private companies. The fact that they can all team up, and are all left leaning agencies that can wipe someone’s face off the face of the internet, they can silence other peoples points of view, if that’s not fascism and a threat to our democracy than idk what is.
Ain’t no way out of our current president, and our former president, that you think our former president had dementia. You are living in a fucking bubble. Biden is juiced w Addy just so he can be coherent.
