A consumption tax is extremely regressive - as poorer ppl.spend a much larger % of their incomes as compared to the wealthy.
Sales Tax is horribly regressive, because as a percentage of earnings the rich donâ€™t spend the majority of their money like the lower and middle class do.
Yeah, that's $114B that the poor and remaining middle class will have to pay because there wouldn't be a way to collect it from rich people any longer. This is just one facet of how Republicans are bad at and for the economy.
Edit edit: Can I get a CBO score on this bill. Would it even generate close to the same amount of tax we collect now?
Even if that scenario, that tax is regressive. Billionaires won't stop buying yachts cos of the sale while the non-rich people who depend on second-hand bicycle may just be priced out by a small increase in sales tax.
Folks, please save your outrage. Dole them out in small increments because the next 2 years will see lots of bills like this. If you waste all your outrage on this one, where will you be in 2024...out of outrage? Burnt out? Let's pace outselves.
