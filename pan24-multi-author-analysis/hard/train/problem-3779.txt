In a world where half the electorate already doesnt know what “facts” are…RCV just exponentially complicates.
So you believe that the electorate, including republicans are well informed and have accurate and complete knowledge of all candidates in their races?? Not just the one they are voting for??
You would be suprised. The libertarian Party loves the attention he is getting them now but he got barely any support from the party. In fact the right wing tried to vote None Of The Above to him running. And something not a lot of people know : There was an of the Libertarian Party this year.
I put neutral in qoutes because last plank said basically: "there are a lot of good faith views on abortion so the government should stay out of it.".
I get ya. I feel better about most libertarians because I can mostly talk policy (unless they are the extreme anarchist flavor of libertarianism). Most debates boil down my argument to “Government cannot solve all our problems, and nor should it, but there are many problems that only government can solve”. What problems that can be better solved by government is the subject of debate. Examples are regulating economies, providing education, military, etc.
it’s a moving target. Libertarianism has remained somewhat constant, but under Trump many of his actions were very “big government”. That being said, most Libertarians I know started off as Republicans, if that counts for anything.
