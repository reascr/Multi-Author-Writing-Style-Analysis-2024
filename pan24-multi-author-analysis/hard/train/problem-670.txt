Early ballots must arrive before polls close at 7pm on election day, whether by mail or being dropped off in person.
This is why I post my ballot or drop it off at least a week before election day. This year I received my ballot on 10/14, it was in the mail by 10/15, received and signature verified by 10/18.
I didn't return mine that quickly, but it was signature verified on 11/2, and then counted in a batch on 11/4.
County elections departments in Arizona post lists of what ballot batch is counted when. Looking at the one for Pima County, early ballots that arrived up to a week prior may still have taken until election day to get counted.
Florida starts their election 10+ days before election day AND they count their votes as they receive them (those votes are REQUIRED to be counted and tabulated prior to election day). Many of us just do early voting (not ballot drop off).
Arizona counts early ballots as they're received too. And early voting here starts Oct 12th. But the counting of early ballots isn't completed prior to election day, and unlike Florida, there isn't a requirement for it to be.
