To start, I think education should be free, this is not a defense of the system. But you might not realize, when we're talking about endowments, the donor can be veeeery specific regarding what the money is intended for and the university has to respect that. That leads to some areas being very well funded, other departments and initiatives have to fight to survive. And anyways, at the institutions you're talking about, generally people who would be getting a loan to go to, say, a state school or mid-tier university would get a free ride, would they not? People generally only pay tuition at Ivy League schools when they can afford it, from what I understand.
Of course, the more expensive colleges are also (ab)using adjuncts. Iâ€™m just saying community colleges are a less-bad option for a student, not a solution.
Lowering tuition costs for future students is like putting a sawstop on after that accident to prevent more from happening.
Forgiving loans with no attempt to lower tuition costs for future students is like getting past an enemy trap but leaving it to take out the next platoon.
