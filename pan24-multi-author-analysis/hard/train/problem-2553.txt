When you’ve got the momentum and advantage it’s not best practice to let the competition dictate the game. I’m disappointed that I have to describe US politics this way, it’s sickening.
I'm not saying he hasn't done good as well, just that Democrats have become a very pro-corporate party and it's disappointing.
Young voters are big part of the reason there wasn't a red wave, and Biden doesn't really inspire them. Younger voters had a big impact on the midterms, and that's despite still having a relatively low turnout. If you could find a good, younger candidate they could relate to, that could easily make up for any incumbent bonus.
There were younger candidates. Beto was a star at one point. It's not like we have a better candidate just sitting around waiting to be tapped. Maybe if some of the primary candidates from 2020 kept momentum, and maybe if they were better integrated with the current administration, it would make sense for them to run in 2024 if Biden were literally unable.
He seems to be doing just fine. Barring that, we should be working on a good candidate for 2028 so that we have continuity of progress.
