Basically. It's up to the individual states to enforce whatever actions they think are necessary once they decide that Russia committed war crimes. Mostly it'll probably be more sanctions since no one is planning to go to nuclear war with Russia. Ukraine also wants to set up a tribunal to prosecute the Russians, but again the results of the tribunal don't force anyone to do anything, and are only enforceable by the individual states agreeing to do something.
This motion is presented in the general assembly, which means it can't be vetoed (and all 193 member states have equal voting power). You're thinking about resolutions in the security council which end up having military operations to enforce them (which is why they can be vetoed).
Only a resolution by the Security Council will care any real weight, and such a resolution would be vetoed by Russia. One would hope the inevitable failure of these efforts stimulates efforts to reform the structure of the UN, particularly its empowered decision-making bodies.
