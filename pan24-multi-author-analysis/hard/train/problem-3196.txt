I did an overseas tech support call once for my company's software product. He was a French professor.
Wow, what a pompous ass. Condescending, insulting, made every generalization about Americans he could think of including how US companies always build software that doesn't work because it's built for the cheapest cost possible. (I replied with, sir I'm from Canada and that's Canadian software you're using.).
Says the . The only reason Russia didn’t have a African colony wasn’t because of any anti-imperialism morals, but because the French kicked them out when they tried to get one.
OK, so… Before this occurred, he was receiving threats to assassinate his son in Africa if the Russians didn’t leave Africa to leave it wide open for the French. He thought the anonymous parcel was his son’s head. I’m sure he wasn’t being rational by the time that parcel arrived. But, needless to say, as he opened the box, it exploded and he’s fighting for his life in the hospital. He may still die. Jeez… I would not want to be on the bad side right now.
