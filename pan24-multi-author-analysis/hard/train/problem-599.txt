_”Wolf 1069 b is tidally locked to its parent star, which means one side is always in daylight and the opposite side is in darkness. Although this means that the planet doesn't have a day/night cycle like Earth, the researchers hope that the dayside of the planet could still have habitable conditions.”_.
One would imagine the twilight-zone between perpetual day and perpetual night to be the strip with the most variation in lifeforms.
And assuming... Rain as well, holy hell those monsoons could be epic -assuming the planet would have Earth-like but extreme-scale temperatures and at least half the liquid water on the surface as there are on Earth... Though it could make a really cool setting for a SciFi-novel or a movie.
Damn, I forgot the exact term... Anyway, shouldn't there be fairly habitable zone in-between the day- and night-sides? Sort of twilight zone where temperatures and light would have aspects from both sides, blending into something that's less extreme?
What kind of weather patterns would such a planet have and would the dark side have huge icecaps while the day side would presumably be dry as a bone. Assuming the day side is as warm as -say +70c and the night side to be something closer to 0c... Shouldn't this stable temperature difference cause really violent winds and storm fronts to form?
