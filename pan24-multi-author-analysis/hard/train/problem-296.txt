The House Republican majority is so slim they will not be able to get the votes they need to conduct anything like that again. In fact, I am wondering if at this point they want the Jan 6 panel to continue and see Trump indicted, if only to get him off the 2024 table.
I don't care what Pence says about Trump today, now that he has Murdoch's approval to have an opinion. Every one of those creeps coming down on Trump now were solidly loyal right up until the midterms.
They don't care about anything but political power and since it is clear they can't count on riding Trump's coattails anymore, they are ready to kick him to the curb.
Oh now that the midterms are basically over, Republicans didn't win,and now they suddenly care about trump being shitty lmao.
The Republican party was still behind trump until he became unelectable (aka seeing all his candidates flop in the midterms).
You can come out and denounce trump, but that'll likely do little more than cause a political base to be lost, and be cast out of the Republican Party. The people who would've listened to Pence denouncing Trump were likely already against Trump. Taking this guy down requires more than just condemnation, because he will reflect it right back and put you in danger.
There was an interview with Trump recently, where he admitted that he wanted all of the credit and none of the blame. Flat out admitted it. This goes to show we're we've been misguided about Trump.
Furthermore, it's likely Pence has played some part in Trump's recent fall. With the many investigations occurring, it seems likely Pence has played a significant part. So there could've easily been external factors, where if Pence came out publicly, the investigation could be harmed. Trump's politics rely on mind games/manipulation after all, and combating this requires tact.
