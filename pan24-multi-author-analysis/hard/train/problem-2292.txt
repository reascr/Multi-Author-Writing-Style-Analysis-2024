You can give him credit for serving the national party while also acknowledging that he lost his own election, and several other seats in NY were lost because he undermined his colleagues.
It's time to face the truth: both Republicans and Democrats are a disaster at the national and state level because they work for corporate lobbyists, not the people they were elected to serve. Both parties are beholden to wealthy donors and special interest groups, and their policies reflect that. From tax breaks for corporations to cuts in social services, the interests of the wealthy and powerful take precedence over the needs of ordinary citizens. Until we break the stranglehold that corporate money has on our political system, we can't expect anything to change.
While the Republicans are undoubtedly more corrupt, can we really believe that Democrats who accept generous donations from corporate lobbyists are not influenced by them?
An yes Republicans are far more corrupt then Democrats but you still have to ask Why is it that when it comes to supporting the rich and powerful, both corporate Democrats and Republicans can find common ground and pass bills easily? But when it comes to bills that serve the working class, there's a bunch of fighting and very little gets done and Corporate Democrats put up a weak fight?
