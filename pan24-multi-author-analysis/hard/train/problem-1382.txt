Some intelligence people had said not that it was Russian disinformation, but that without any specific knowledge about the laptop, the whole thing looks like a Russian disinformation op.
I highly doubt the FBI has actually looked at the contents. It's an illegally hacked laptop that was passed around political operatives before making a show or turning it over to the feds. The whole thing is inadmissable and if anything in it was real, going after that lead on the basis of it coming from the laptop would probably poison the well of anything that came of that lead.
Nobody has really seen the supposed laptop besides the FBI and the political operatives that tampered with it before turning it over. The whole story is about as ridiculous as any other Republican conspiracy theory.
The hoax as you’re describing it is the GOP slant on what the hoax was. The actual evidence folks were following at the time were “we need a back channel to Russia,” “Russia if you’re listening,” “we’d be bankrupt if it wasn’t for the Russians,” handing off polling data, the $ through the NRA (butina), “so to be clear mr trump has no financial relationships with any Russian oligarchs” “that’s what he said, that’s what I, that’s obviously what our position is,” and the million other connections between high ranking trump officials and Russian oligarchs- but the whole thing was kicked off because Russia hacked both the rnc and dnc and leaked dnc emails only- this was bragged about by Papadopoulos over drinks in Australia. All of this was known relatively early.
