You're right, americans totally don't treat kids like property, that's abuse rates are so low, kid's aren't kicked out at 18, and child marriage laws in most states definitely aren't remaining on books vote after vote.
Most states allow child marriage when parents consent, as well as beating your child as long as you argue it's for discipline. This is children as property in action.
Whataboutism would be saying the first thing doesn't matter, when I clearly said to a much lesser extent.
No I am specifically NOT making comparative statements about which is worse because it doesn't matter. Both are terrible. I'd certainly argue killing 14k is worse, but there are many people who vote Red that would argue being pro-choice is quantifiably worse. ..
I mean.... Yeah.... They probably want to do a lot of crazy shit. It doesn't mean they will actually do it lol. As I said, they're not that crazy. At the end of the day they want to maintain the status quo. Even they know It would mean the end of their regime if they went too far... They're already balancing on the edge of the knife as is.
Iran is crazy, but not that fucking crazy. That would be an absolute death sentence to their country, even they know that.
