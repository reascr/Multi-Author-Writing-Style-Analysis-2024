Don't forget attempted genocide by way of mass abduction of women and children whom they will attempt to program as loyal Russians. Even aside from the mass slaughter of Ukrainian citizens.
What russia is attempting to do here is genocide. They're trying to erase Ukraine from history. They use the word "nazi" for anyone they see as an enemy with no regard to the actual definition.
It is beyond irony that the Russian crime empire uses anti Nazi rhetoric for propaganda purposes when they are behaving like textbook Nazi's without the German.
When Russia says Nazi they are not engaging in doublespeak, where they accuse the enemy of doing exactly what they do, themselves. To them "Nazi" simply means "western enemy of russia." Russians don't care about torture or concentration camps, why would they? It's their preferred solution for political differences. Even russian mercenaries ride into battle with nazi symbology tattooed on them.
This is IMPORTANT because it is the SAME mental game that fox news and the new republican fascists play. Replace Nazi with Liberal, and the thought patterns are indistinguishable. To them there are only republicans and enemies of the state.
The greatest crime in stalinist and Putins Russia is opposing the state. You'll get killed for it. When russians are asked questions and give mindless, contradictory answers, it isn't because they're stupid. It's because only an enemy of the state, a nazi, would say what the state doesn't want you to say.
But the term doublespeak originated in the book 1984, not nazi germany. Goebbels propaganda could be called doublespeak/think at times.
