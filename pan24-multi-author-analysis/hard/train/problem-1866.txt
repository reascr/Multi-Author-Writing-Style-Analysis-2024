Since China and Turkey are in on it, there could be deals where Russia gives X to China cheaply so China can give Y to Cuba, etc etc.
Cuba's interesting set of economic bail-out buddies says a lot: China, Russia, Algeria and Turkey. It remains to be seen if Cuba's long-standing economic crisis ever gets resolved.
The truth is that the Cuban regime is what holds back the country from having relations. We already know that their whole "humanitarian assistance" with doctors has the government withholding payment from those doctors to keep them from basically running away of the country.
Are you aware that only a minority of abroad Cubans are up to that level of wealth? Well fuck all of those teachers, doctors and their families that managed to run to other countries am i right? If they hate an authoritarian regime that has made sure to keep their population in misery, they must be rich.
This is pretty much it. If you open trade with Cuba, it's pretty much like giving more money to the regime. As long as Cuban remains under a one party rule, shit is likely gonna stay the same. Let Cubans vote, let independent media exist, and then change will start.
Ok, then let Cuban people vote for any political party they want would be a start. Let Cuban people read news from independent sources. Let Cuban workers start their own businesses. Let Cuban workers sell the product of their work in a free market. Let Cuban people travel to foreign countries.
It's not only Cubans in florida. In other countries, Cubans who fled the country have that sentiment, and I'm not talking about rich cubans living in their mansions in Florida. I've had multiple Cuban teachers here in DR and whenever they mention Cuba, they don't have nice things to say about the government, and I wouldn't put them alongside Republicans.
