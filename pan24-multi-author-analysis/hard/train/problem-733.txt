Lol. Qatar spent billions on this so they could become more visible on the world stage and I went from knowing very little about Qatar to hating it with every fiber of my being.
Difference here is that Qatar has deep pockets and fifa is more than willing to whore out the sport, its fans and what minimal amount of integrity fifa had left for that money.
My take is that FIFA has been telling everyone for years “don’t worry, Qatar will be great hosts,” and at this point FIFA is too embarrassed to sanction Qatar and thereby admit they were even a little bit wrong.
It's ok, there is no way that fifa boss Gianni Infantino will let Qatar boss him around and he is above reproach as he has absolute no connection to Qatar... checks notes... Ahh, it seems he moved himself and his family to Doha over a year ago and pays "rent" on a house - probably to one of the members of the royal family...
He response will be something along the lines of "Nothing to see here, and stop wearing fucking rainbow hats. By the way I should know what it's like to be persecuted, because I used to have rainbow colored hair".
