So even if France, Germany, and the UK did have the power to offer NATO membership to Ukraine, they could not accept it at this current time. Even pre-2022 before the invasion they could not get accepted because they had disputed territory in the Donbass and Crimea.
One of the conditions for joining NATO is that the country must have resolved any conflicts with its neighbors or other countries in accordance with international law.
The actual condition is that the country must demonstrate the intent to resolve any such conflicts in accordance with international law. Ukraine has met this condition.
Secondly, it states it's a factor in deciding whether to invite a state to join. In other words, this is not a hard binary yes/no. It's not saying that countries must have settled their disputes to be members (or many existing NATO countries should not be in NATO); rather that they must show a commitment to settling them in that manner.
And again, it's about showing the commitment to resolving these types of conflicts according to international law. Ukraine has shown this to be the case. The fact that a hostile power has illegally invaded them doesn't change that.
