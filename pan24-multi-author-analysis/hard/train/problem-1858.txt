Even in cases where it’s undeniably, statutory rape, such as when a 10 year old becomes pregnant, the GOP will deny the case exists, deflect with whataboutism and then try to prosecute the doctor anyway.
Some ectopic pregnancies miscarry on their own in a process called “expectant management.” This is what a lot of doctors are having to do in states with restrictive abortion laws- wait and hope the patient miscarries on her own. Sometimes when an embryo implants in a fallopian tube, the removal of the tube is required in the removal of an ectopic pregnancy, which isn’t a “provision” that is necessary in an induced abortion. And sometimes, treatment of an ectopic pregnancy is nearly identical to the patient to an electively induced abortion.
“[T]he indication and treatment for ectopic pregnancies is distinct from the indication and provision of induced abortion”.
No, of course not. Any ectopic pregnancy is life threatening to both baby and mother and must be treated.
With all these unwanted babies being born, who is going pay for prenatal care, ultrasounds and the birth of the babies? C-sections cost thousands — who pays for that?
