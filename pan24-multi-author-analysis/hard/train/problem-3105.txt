Really? You think the global response against the Iraq invasion and the response against the Ukraine invasion are the same? Where were/are the American sanctions, embargoes, wealth seizures? How come the world didn’t isolate the US?
Lmao imagine the US on some moral high horse over one of the most peaceful countries in history. Even Russia can’t compete with all the terrible things the US has done in the world.
Saddam didn’t want to be an American puppet anymore and the US found that unacceptable. Zelensky doesn’t want to be a Russian puppet and Russia finds that unacceptable. The difference here is that the US could’ve just let that go as Iraq is far away in the Middle East and even if it wasn’t it’s not like saddam could do anything against the US. Ukraine is right next door to Russia and if Ukraine wanted to it could join NATO and build a NATO military base in Russia’s backyard.
Ukraine would never join NATO as long as it have an active conflict on our territory, so a fairy tale about NATO expansion is for dumb people, if we could join, we would do it at any second, but NATO not gonna allow it until the conflict is resolved.
Firstly Saddam literally was a dictator that ordered rape of family members of his critics and mass executed civilians, he killed 30 000 of Iraqis with mustard gas . In 1980, 70,000 Shi\a were arrested, and never heard from them again.
