Same page for helping Ukraine? Lol what are you smoking? A majority of House Republicans are ready to stop sending aid to Ukraine. Hell some are even for Putin.
I’m an American and I think it’s stupid and crazy to spend money on military rather than free healthcare, free education and social programs that can help people.
Nobody thinks you (as a country) spend money on military rather than free healthcare, it's not a binary choice. That's all your internal marketing and arguments.
We think you don't want free healthcare because you see the individual as more important than wider society. You would rather step over dead children than tax others to stop children of the poor dying.
You already spend more on healthcare as individuals than any European nation, with worse outcomes. If an American wants a child, it's statistically better for them to move to Russia, where survival rates to the age of 5 are higher.
Even the phrasing of military vs health you put indicates you may want free health but individuals shouldn't pay extra for it.
