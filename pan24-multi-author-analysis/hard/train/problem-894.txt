Seeing Lukashenko's name often reminds me of a brilliant scene early on in Servant of the People. Zelensky is practicing meeting foreign heads of state using body doubles, and immediately stands up each time to greet them. When the Lukashenko double walks in, Zelensky's advisor stops him saying something along the lines of "no no, there's no need to get up for him". Zelensky casually replies "of course".
It's probably not just Zelensky himself. I imagine that a lot of the politicians that would otherwise have fought one another politically now cooperate against the immediate common real enemy.
I wish Ukraine a boring future and nothing worse than a moderate corruption scandal on the news ASAP.
I think you're discounting just how much corruption existed in Ukraine prewar, not that it's all gone now. Since the outbreak of the war a lot of Russia's political pawns are gone, it'll be significantly easier for Zelensky to pull through with his promises in the new political climate.
I don't know much about global history so my examples involve the USA but I'm sure if we have examples spanning almost 250 years, then there should be many examples globally.
