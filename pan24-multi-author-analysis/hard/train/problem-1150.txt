They are in violation of the UN Charter which they signed in 1991. It specifically requires ALL nations to never seize and annex territory by force of arms. First Crimea and now the Eastern Provinces of Ukraine, meanwhile bombing clearly civilian targets in Central and Western Ukraine. The UN General Assembly should expell Russia completely, not just from the Security Council, after all the USSR was one of the permanent members not Russia. Russia wasn't even a separate entity of the UN until 1991, whereas Ukraine SSR was a founding charter member of the UN and merely changed its name to Ukraine without the SSR moniker.
Actually in removal of Russia from the Security Council Russia doesn't get a veto vote in the UNSC. If Russia keeps threatening first use of Nuclear weapons, even tactical weapons, they will be removed from the UNSC.
Russia is clearly the external aggressor seizing territory and annexing it permanently from Ukraine which is clearly forbidden by the UN Charter.
The Russian Federation broke their most important treaty obligation when they invaded Ukraine in 2014 and subsequently annexed territory. They canâ€™t claim the rights of the USSR if they abandoned the responsibilities of the USSR.
