As tragic as the Khashoggi killing was, no one outside of reddit realistically expected America to be hard on the Saudis and push them closer to China/Russia or lose influence with OPEC.
Saudi Arabia is the worlds largest exporter of Oil and ultimately the Biden administration has Russia/China as enemies already. Saudi Arabia is also at the forefront of determining global oil production/prices.
There is a really interesting Video on Youtube, where the creator guessed the relative remaining amount of oil in the Saudis reserves.
China has the ability to make larger chips, like for simple electronics, yes, but with the current CPUs, we talk atom sized transistors with quantum tunneling issues (we got so small with CPUs the electrons just phase trough walls of a few atoms randomly sometimes), which is extremly hard to make.
Turns out, when the americans left, they 'found' (read, faked) almost double the oil reserves over night.
Bruh look at their demographics. China lacks vital stuff like high precision machining and Chip manufacture. They just lost access to that and the leader is driving it into the ground faster.
