Your veins are coursing with plastic, weather patterns are shifting into unpredictability that threatens the food supply, and giant methane craters are exploding in the tundra, but have you TRIED just BEING OPTIMISTIC? .
Yeah. It's hard to overstate how good the US and Russia have been dismantling their arsenals from Cold War peaks. Both have drawn down over 90% of their nuclear weapons, and the largest bottleneck in removing more is that dismantling the things is slow and expensive.
The United States in the 60's had over 30k nuclear bombs or warheads and by 1986 the Soviets had 45k nuclear bombs and warheads. Many of these were tactical nukes meant to be used by fighter jets or short range missiles on the frontline of battles.
It became a game where because the U.S. had so many nukes the Soviets needed more to take them out, which meant the U.S. needed more to target the additional Soviet nukes etc etc.
Because Russian and the United States agreed to stop building more nukes and shrink their arsenal(The united States in the 60's had 30k nuclear warheads and the Russians caught up in the 80's with 45k nuclear warheads).
It had to do with assuring incredibly high probability of kill on the many Soviet nuclear installations (the more warheads you target at something the more likely you are to destroy it).
Additionally with “super fuzing” it’s clear U.S. doctrine is to use SSBNs as counterforce weapons as they can attain probability of kills in excess of 0.99 on hardened structures like missile silos (almost guaranteed destruction with just one warhead).
Yes if the U.S. is lucky they’ll get like 20-25 warheads with GBI (not counting the warheads SM-3 equipped AEGIS ships might get) but those warheads could be on critical targets and to ensure target destruction additional warheads have to be tasked in the event one is lost.
