The collection of guns laws meant to keep unqualified people from getting weapons, such as the ones listed here in Oregon. For instance, why is it bad to wait to get a gun past 3 days? There have been various mass shootings with guns that were given to people whos background checks were late, so they were given guns by default.
Gun controllers know guns have the right to murder people, even though it is illegal for people to murder other people. That's why they think guns need to be banned.
Now I’m not arguing against gun reform. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different outcomes; but simply waving a magic wand and saying all guns are illegal will not solve things. Because there will always be people with guns in this country, they’ll just be in the hands of criminals and the police. That isn’t even addressing the fact that confiscating firearms will involve a non-zero number of deaths in its execution.
Almost all of the modern gun restrictions were put in place as a response to minorities arming themselves en masse, and lawfully assembling in a show of solidarity. They are not designed to restrict criminal’s access to firearms, they are meant to keep firearms out of the hands of the poorer population. Because anyone with money will not be impeded by any legislation.
