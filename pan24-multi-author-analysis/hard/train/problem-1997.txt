The American administration wouldn’t have done what they did if they didn’t consider potential consequences and the Saudi administration wouldn’t be doing what it is doing for no reason. Based off the Americans recent actions it seems they are more concerned with the pacific and revitalizing it’s homeland. It’s entirely possible the Americans no longer care and the Saudi Arabians are trying to goad the Americans back into caring or they may be courting China as an alternative in the event the Americans actually don’t care anymore. I do doubt China will waste money and military assets abroad defending Saudi Arabia though. Things are definitely changing.
The USA is making moves to bring manufacturing and certain other industries back home. Some of these moves come to the detriment of Allies and have Europe, Japan and Korea side eyeing us. America is clearly focusing inward, how far it goes, who knows. But the Saudi Arabia’s of the world wouldn’t be making these moves for nothing.
But if Iran attacks SaudiArabia we are first to defend them? After the Saudis sided with Putin on oil cuts they are cosing up to Xi, time to re asses WHO is not our ally any longer based on the OBVIOUS.
