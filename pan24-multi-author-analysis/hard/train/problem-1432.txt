I can't see how you can be an american and not realize that this war by proxy is actually great for our country from a geopolitical strategy standpoint, and unlike a lot of our military actions, also the morally right decision to boot.
I understand the anti-war belief, but you canâ€™t be anti-war when a war like this is going to set the tone for whether other nations will engage in territorial aggression.
If only they could understand the horrors that will happen to Ukrainians if the aid dries up, and the Russians rebound.
But then they put a little twist in there by suggesting that instead of doing anything to russia, they should just stop sending weapons to Ukraine.
If they want peace you need to send more arms to Ukraine to push Russia back. Anything else Russia will surely strike again. Their nose has been bloodied too much and humiliated to let things just stand.
No need for Ukraine to negotiate, they did nothing wrong. Also any short term Ceasefire would only benefit Russian to give it time for new troop training, mobilization, resupply and entrench their positions further.
