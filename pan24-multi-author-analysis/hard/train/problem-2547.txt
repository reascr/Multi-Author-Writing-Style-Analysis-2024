Yes because you're asking them to give their assessment of a system they have little understanding/information of. The factor that matters is if they're happy with the cost they're paying and happy with the care they are receiving.
It's obviously not shit if they're happy with the care they're receiving at the cost they're paying. I get that Bernie wants to push his MFA plan, and some who want "free" insurance support it too, but the reality is most people are happy with the healthcare they already have.
I’m to Bernie’s left on health care (I support socialized healthcare like Britain has, not just insurance.). But I’ve read the polling data. While Medicare for all has strong support among Democrats (around 70%) it’s opposed almost universally by republicans (like 15% support) and about 50/50 by independents. It’s not even close to having the votes.
The public option would get us to 98% coverage vs 99% with M4A. And it has broad voter support, with something lien 90% support from Democrats, 70% from independents and about 50% or republicans.
