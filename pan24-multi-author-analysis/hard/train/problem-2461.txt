The Weimar Republic had only existed for a little more than a decade and was the only attempt at a non-authoritarian government in its history. It failed. There was no democratic tradition, no long standing foundations of free people. It had also been defeated in a World War and it was a national shame. The Nazis flourished in such an environment.
The United States, despite its flaws, is not in those circumstances. There is no doubt to someone with a passing knowledge of the Nazi rise that what we are seeing here mirrors the fascism of that time. But the country, culture, society, and political order are different. And the internet, which helped flame this fascism also has spread its antidote, far and wide, and generations who will not permit its neck being stepped on.
German society in 1933 was very very different than American society 90 years later. The fascist playbook is the same, and they will no doubt wreck havoc, but the internal resistance to it in 2023 America is far more powerful than the authoritarian leaning social order of 1933 Germany.
Some good news is that these Swings toward Fascism in the past tend to last only around 10-15 years and are then followed by a pretty strong progressive period as people strongly reject it when it inevitably falls apart.
