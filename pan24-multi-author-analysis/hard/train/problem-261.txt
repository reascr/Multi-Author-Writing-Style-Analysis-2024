I'm sorry, but do you really not see the problem with this? More regs mean higher costs for the freight comps, leading to higher costs for the manufacturer or importer bringing their stuff to market. This means higher costs for the little guy just wanting to buy eggs.
I isolated 2019 for the simple reason that it was the first year that the TCJA [1] really took effect. Said Act was passed in 2017 to take effect FY 2018. Considering the usual lag, it is reasonable to expect 2019 to see the first major effects of it. Had TFG [2] not cocked up [3] the response to the Chinese novel coronavirus, it is doubtful that 2020 would have been any better. Therefore, based on simple elimination, 2019 is unfortunately the only year we have to judge the TCJA.
Don't believe it? Consider this. 45 was the most deregging admin of the 21st century, and 2019 saw the greatest real income increase of the bottom quintile of households in the 21st c. Coincidence? I think not.
Nope. It was the Democrats Unemployment on steroids due Trumps Covid 19 debacle that crashed the US economy.
