>This is the direct result of years of conservative-led efforts to successfully defund, defang, and delegitimize the IRS. Over the past eight years, Congress has steadily reduced the agency's enforcement budget by billions of dollars, down 25 percent from what it was in 2008. And by cutting out only relatively small chunks at a time, the gutting has largely avoided public outcry. Unsurprisingly, according to ProPublica, the IRS is in disarray on the inside, resulting in "a bureaucracy on life support.".
I call [crap] on this excuse. The ROI would pay for itself. They don't audit the rich because the rich would see to it that whoever at the IRS authorized the audit would be out of a job before the audit concluded.
They are not, tax returns aren’t released to the public. Maybe you’re thinking of financial statements, but this doesn’t show the tax they pay.
Cash paid for income taxes isn’t the same thing as the income tax they actually pay. At the time their financials are released to the public, their tax return hasn’t even been started yet.
Their tax returns aren’t even completed until a good 7 or 8 months after their financials are released.
