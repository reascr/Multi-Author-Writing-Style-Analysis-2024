The main advantage of the Abram's turbine engine is that it can go about 2-3x as long between major overhauls compared to a diesel tank engine with similar HP. But when the time for that overhaul comes, the turbine engine's overhaul will be more expensive.
Most people consider spending synonymous with budget, and the discretionary budget is only a fraction of the federal budget.
Discretionary Budget is what gets voted on and includes military, education, transportation, science, CDC, NASA, etc.
Besides the WTF Germany, allow Ukraine to get all the tanks it needs logic, an interesting comment on the US Abrams tank. The same criticism when it was built being hugely expensive, hard to maintain and a logistics nightmare without providing a real edge over . Abrams costs close to TWICE that of the Leopard and costs three times to maintain and fuel. Shows problem with US spending 70% of its budget on military but getting a very poor cost effectiveness and a dangerous logistical weakness.
It is completely dishonest to include 100% self funded Social Security and Medicare which have NOTHING to do with current $30T debt created SOLELY by the discretionary budget.
You are confusing US budget with Social Security and Medicare, which are self funded, have a surplus and have contributed nothing to US debt to Discretionary budget which is the source of 100% US debt and is 70% US military.
