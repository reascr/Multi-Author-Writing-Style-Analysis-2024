It doesn't necessarily mean that. It could also mean everyone is overthinking that these are balloons for spying.
First of all, people were talking about spy satellites from the first balloon reported in the news. And second, this IS different because satellites aren't in our air space. These are. And last, why did you write out the word satellite then put the icon? Did you think we wouldn't recognize the word?
I mean, of they believe that balloons are straight with to engage or notice, or considered benign enough to ignore, they could deliver something like an EMP if it's in their interests to do so, such as if they decided to move against Taiwan.
So they weren’t lying when they said their balloon illegally flying over US airspace was because it blew off course, it was supposed to be illegally flying over Taiwan’s airspace instead….
Prop 2: there has always been more mundane balloon releases locally/by nearby countries that often got blown around and didn't get too much attention until chinese balloon comes along.
Prop 1: china released more balloons that managed to get there after the first one got popped while hoping usa will not escalate.
