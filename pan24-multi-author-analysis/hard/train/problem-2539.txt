In fairness, it's less about acting within the scope of your job and more about not violating "clearly established" law that a "reasonable officer" would have known about. The two are similar, but they are not the same.
For example, imagine that a police officer decided to arrest an individual because they saw that the individual was making fun of them on social media. The individual would have several actions against the police officer, including a ยง 1983 action. If arresting an individual for making fun of an officer on social media was not before considered a violation of an individual's federal rights, then the officer will be protected under qualified immunity because the act did not violate a "clearly established" law.
This is even though the officer was acting outside the scope of their job. Changes to qualified immunity will theoretically help keep the officer accountable when they do things outside the scope of the job.
Qualified immunity means that a police officer cannot be personally sued if he is found to have been acting within the scope of his job.
