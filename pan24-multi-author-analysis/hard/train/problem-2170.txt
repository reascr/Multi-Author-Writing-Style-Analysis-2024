In the early days of the wind energy development ie 2010ish in southern Australia (specifically the western districts) some farmers would get turbines and others wouldn’t as the monetary incentive isn’t small this virtually destroyed some communities.
Some small towns in Australia created “wind turbine collectives” where the funds paid to landowners who allow wind turbines to be installed on their property are pooled and distributed to the community.
In some cases, you have farmers basically just leasing land to wind projects and that's an alternate revenue stream (you can have a failed crop and still get money from the wind leases).
Solar panels have been installed on some farms above either grazing land or crops, in some cases they’re actually beneficial to the thing being farmed.
I mean sure. Its more expensive, has a ridiculously higher risk factor, takes years to build needs tons of vacant land around it, operates for what, 50 years and then the site is unusable for another 50.
Oh and they’re both cheaper, neither will make the land unusable for half a century, and neither can fail in a way that requires large scale evacuations.
