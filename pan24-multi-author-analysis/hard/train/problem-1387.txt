A dilemma exists where one must decide what amount of lying, embellishing, or misrepresenting is tolerable because all people, especially politicians are guilty of it to some degree.
Intent is certainly a mitigating factor but that still doesn't stop the "other side" from attacking what can be alleged to be a lie.
But are the little lies like Elizabeth Warren's about having native American ancestors reach that level? Probably not though her detractors would not agree. Clearly there is some level of acceptable or tolerable lying if the liar is on "our team.".
Lmfao. Imagine saying this during a background check for a new job. "Oh, I just assumed I graduated with the relevant degree for the position I was applying for.".
But that's not what is happening. He didn't acknowledge that he lied, he acknowledged that he misrepresented his major. Did he lie? Almost certainly. But even if they did want to make the headline about lying, they'd likely have to make it super convoluted like "Rep. Ogles Acknowledges Misrepresenting His Major But Critics Allege That He Intentionally Lied." There's no way to prove that he remembered what his major was at that time.
