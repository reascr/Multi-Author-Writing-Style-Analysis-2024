If it was jaywalking or mass murder, do either of those excuse Russia for drafting a foreign national from prison and sending them to fight in a war?
Looks like the Kremlin is not just recruiting , but also foreign nationals who were imprisoned in Russia.
Brittney Griner was sentenced to 9 years in a Russian prison for carrying less than 1 gram of cannabis oil in her luggage.
For instance, ex-WNBA player Brittney Griner got sentenced in Russia for NINE YEARS of imprisonment for posessing a tiny tiny amount of canabis oil (less than a gram (sic!) of hashish oil in her luggage).
“Being sufficiently aware that the movement of narcotic drugs is not allowed… no later than February 17, 2022 at an unspecified location under unspecified circumstances from an unidentified person \[Ms Griner\] bought two cartridges for personal use, which contained 0.252 grams and 0.45 grams of hash oil, totaling 0.702 grams,” the prosecutor said during the trial, TASS reported.
Not necessarily a "large pile of dope". Not at all. Russia, after all, is a fascist state where legal logic is subordinated to political pressure and corruption. Anything can happen there given particular circumstances.
