Apprently that class of ship was designed for 'pack tactics', paired with the flagship of their entire navy, the _Admiral Kuznetsov_. Which just makes you wonder why the hell they thought sending one on its own was a bright idea.
Not that I'm complaining of course, I'm just explaining that it sucked at its job so hard because they seemingly willingly put it into a role it's shit at. Which would almost beggar belief, but then you remember it's the Russian Navy we're talking about here, so.
Really, no one knows when Russians reach a breaking point of mass noncompliance and armed mutiny by conscripts.
No doubt that Russians are dying en masse, but I'm doubtful about the accuracy of any precise figures supplied by any side, and this goes for any war.
Most russians to me appear dead inside even before going to war. They donâ€˜t seem to live just exist. And they try everything they can to expand this kind living scheme to their neighbours who have a higher living standard, a better life, better morals.
