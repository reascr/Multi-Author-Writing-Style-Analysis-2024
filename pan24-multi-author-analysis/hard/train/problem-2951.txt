Ye might even think it's a compliment since he believes that Hitler invented the microphone and the highway. (Needless to say, neither were invented by Hitler.).
The call it what it is. A recent and possibly future Republican President hangs out with Nazis, and is only upset when they think they're better than him.
Yeah letâ€™s call this what it is: trump had dinner with two Nazis, said one of the Nazis really got him, and then far too many elected Republicans waffled when asked about trump having fun with Nazis because those Republicans know that their constituents support Nazis / are Nazis as well.
Let's be honest and call what it is, a White Nationalist 2024 Presidential Candidate had dinner with another White Nationalist, and an entertainment Grifter who has praised Hitler.
I'd put Trump in the boat of an Authoritarian or Fascist in general. It wouldn't matter if it was Hitler or anybody else that fit that bill. He yearns to be someone that has ultimate power. He wants that adulation that Hitler received from his supporters. THAT's all that Trump cares about. He's another narcissist that never got enough love or hugs from Dad.
I'd disagree. Kanye is just following the trend of what Trump did, giving a voice and spotlight to those that have asinine ideas and conspiracy theories in the same way Trump did. He saw how loyal and easily manipulated that base of people are, and for grifters, that base are marks. You say something they agree with and they will do whatever you ask of them next.
