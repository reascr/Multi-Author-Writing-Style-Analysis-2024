It's a state law, which is unenforceable because it is federally illegal against the constitution to discriminate against someone holding office due to their religion.
The body of the Constitution itself specifically forbids a religious test to hold public office, not just Federal office but state office as well. Article VI, Clause 3 reads "The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.".
True. But from all the countries in the region, Qatar has made incredible progress with many things in a short amount of time. I think at this point there's more women in university than men for example. So I have hope.
Coming from a conservative ME family, I totally understand that they're at a different point on the progressive timeline (understand, not agree).
Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending anything, and I think they completely underestimated the whole world cup situation. They want to make clear that they won't give in to outside pressure, which ironically makes them look, well, scared of rainbows.
