I think this shows why solar panels on every house and a few thousand wind turbines spread across the country is a good idea.
I think you'll be surprised how quickly Ukraine manages to fix things, at least to a basic level. Power plants are big, and a single conventional missile won't completely destroy them.
Second, power plants can be massive, and Russia has more than one missile… fairly obviously. Let’s not be optimistic, this is going to be a dark winter for many, many Ukrainians.
For context/source, I’m an electrical engineer, and my close friend works directly in substation design and construction. First, just restarting portion of a power grid while the entire thing is damaged is difficult, and even more difficult while random section could get blown up at any time. Load balancing (power production vs consumption) is going to be insane (and possibly destructively difficult) even if some infrastructure is in tact.
False optimism annoys me, and it devalues the events that people have to live through. People are going to be freezing this winter, and fixes are unlikely to be quick for many areas as long as Russia has a few missiles to toss around.
