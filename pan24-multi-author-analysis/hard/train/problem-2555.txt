Like I know critical thinking skills are in short supply in people who pretend climate change isn’t real, but it’s even sadder than they can’t count either.
The main problem is that politicians who claim to accept global warming don't really believe in it. They don't believe in it, in that they believe it won't impact them. If they have enough money they can escape the personal consequences... it is just an issue for them to leverage public support.... but not make major changes to actually change the result.
All the while.... it diverts money from resolving the problem... which means you never get around to solving the problem. It's a pretty major problem. We're dealing with a global inflationary crisis where cost of living is falling out of control for everyone. How many governments in the world decided to throw money to keep people afloat rather than invest more in renewables?
Climate change is going to mean needing larger ditches to control flooding. It's going to mean desalination plants to produce clean drinkable water. It's going to mean subsidizing the lifestyles of the poorest people so they don't fall too deep into poverty, extreme poverty or death. And as time progresses there's more money that'll need to be dedicated to that.
That requires money. Unimaginable amount of capital investment. But all the money is with EU and US because they already burnt cheap coal and got rich and destroyed the atmosphere.
