the thing is, mammals weren't dying in mass from bird flu until last year, now it keeps happening, the virus mutated to adapt to mammals and is now just a couple of mutations away from Human to Human transmission.
The animals were found to have a mutation of the virus that could make it easier to infect mammals, but there was no evidence of transmission between mammals.
In other words, livestock and poultry are great at making it easier for viruses to spread amongst humans. As to why this is, one author explains:
It is likely that animal agriculture enabled the 1957 Asian Flu, 1968 Hong Kong Flu, bird flu, and the 2009 swine flu. Of these, bird flu is the cause for most concern. In past outbreaks, the case-fatality (CF) rate in humans was 60 percent, although one study suggests that if it became a larger pandemic, it would have a median CF rate of approximately 23.5 percent. It is thought that the 1918 Spanish Flu may have infected one-third of the global population and had a CF rate of 2.5 percent. If bird flu were to mutate in such a way that it was anywhere near as contagious as Spanish Flu, with a CF rate almost 10 times higher than Spanish Flu, the results would be apocalyptic. As two authors wrote in a WHO publication:
Perhaps the biggest risk of disease concerning livestock and poultry is influenza A - the only influenza virus known to cause pandemics. It is hypothesized that every influenza virus that causes pandemics in humans is derived from avian influenza in aquatic birds. Normally this wouldn't be an issue for us. The infected wild birds usually don't get sick, and the virus doesn't easily spread amongst humans.) But industrialized animal agriculture has changed that. One scientific review writes:
