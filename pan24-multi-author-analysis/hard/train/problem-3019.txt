Cars have tons of plastic on the exterior. Fires produce tons of radiant heat which starts melting those plastics and then a wayward flame or ember sets it off and the rest of the car burns from there.
At an airshow I was at many years ago, regular old joes had 30+ cars go up in flames because one flamed out and caught the others parked nearby.
rental lot returns are parked very VERY close. This was a problem in southwest florida international's car fire that caught from car to car consuming thousands of cars a few years back.
I was standing at the last link's fire when the first car went up and watched it burn through the first car, hit the fuel tank and then get all the 5 cars adjacent to it, and they caught all the cars near them and so on. I used my fire extinguisher, and in the time it took the on property ready fire crew to get there, there were dozens of cars already burned out.
I saw a small engine bay fire destroy many vehicles parked next to it. This is anecdotal. But it was a small gas leak in the engine bay of one car parked in a long row of cars. The fire kept spreading car-to-car.
