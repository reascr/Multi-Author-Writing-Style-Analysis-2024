Discharge petition would bypass committee and bring a bill to an full house vote with 218 signatures. There’s gonna be a few Republicans that don’t want our credit rating to drop.
Republicans generally don't want to be the lightning rod because they don't want to be blamed. I guess McCarthy doesn't have anything else going for him.
My prediction: McCarthy has NOT been given a mandate but he'll nevertheless act and speak as if he had. His involvement with the 06Jan coup attempt will be mercilessly and repeatedly swept under the rug as his staffers and supporters alike point in some random direfction and shout "OOOOOHHH LKook at that shiny thing over THERE....!).
Yeah. I think the Atlantic might have gotten the modern House Freedom Caucus confused with the founding House Freedom Caucus and members like Justin Amash who have in fact argued precisely this point. The restoration of democracy in the House by reducing the Speaker to their proper role as a president of the body rather than a dictator.
In an actual democracy, votes would be had for bills that did not have the votes pre-screened. A decentralized house wouldn't turn to dysfunction. It would certainly be less efficient, but that reduced efficiency is a necessary by-product of democracy.
