Professional pollsters like YouGov and MorningConsult which were fairly accurate last year are showing the same thing. DeSantis took a lead for a couple of months after the Midterms, but Trump has taken it back in most polls.
BUT interesting that Trump is so far ahead of DeSantis with GOP'ers as previous polls showed the opposite. Rally round the crook syndrome maybe?
GOP pollsters are notoriously unprofessional and, as a result, inaccurate, as we saw in 2022. So figuring out who this pollster is and how far off they were in 2022 is first order of business.
Totally true as DeSantis barely won his first election in FL. If Trump had not endorsed him, fair to say a number of the faithful would not have shown up to vote.
DeSantis is scared enough of Trump supporters that he won't run if Trump runs. No one can really as Trump has enough supporters that no one can challenge him in the GOP was we saw with last election. Trump is the kingmaker within the GOP.
In that case, Trump is the "candidate maker", not the kingmaker. His candidates lose the race for "king", but the win the race to be the Republican candidate.
