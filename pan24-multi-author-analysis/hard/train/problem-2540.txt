Sorry you heard wrong there brother. At the start of the war?Yeah I would say their planes were superior. Mid/late war?
Also it takes two to end a war. The Russians can't simply declare the war to be over. If the Ukrainians continue to conduct offensive operations then the war continues.
As much as any weapon delivery or sanction, that man's PR and awareness campaign is what has kept Ukraine alive and in the fight.
100%. Strategically it would have been better for all such talks to be secret if the outcomes were going to be the same, but Ukraine wouldn't have got even 10% of what it has got without Zelenskyy making it public and generating the huge amounts of public support that he has.
Most of the west didnt really know enough about Ukraine to expect anything significantly different from Yanukovich in that part of the world prior to this conflict, which is why Zelensky is going to be such an icon moving forward.
I think it was a combination of Yanukovich being such a russian stooge when he was in(leading to his ousting) and Zelensky being an unknown quantity with how he'd react to a crisis. Zelensky wound up having massive steel balls when it came to confronting Russian aggression, and Europe decided enough was enough and supplied Ukraine with arms to repel the Russians, but even so, the Ukrainians have shown remarkable resolve and ability, and are an inspiration around the world.
