It's because China isn't really considering sending weapons but with this threat it wants to pressure the west to the negotiation table and see the peace plan (more a proposition plan) as a good foundation for future talks.
I get it but it's the way the Chinese talk, they always want to please everyone (at the risk of pleasing no one at the end). While it has clearly chosen Russia side China is very tepid in its support, it wants the upper hand and while Ukraine territory should be held intact, I feel that its fate will sadly be decided by major powers at the negotiation table.
The choice isn't between 'giving Ukraine 100%' and whatever it is China is doing, it is a sliding scale of support that some countries are providing more to those that are completely ignoring the situation, to those that are actively assisting Russia in it's invasion.
Edit: Curious to the downvoters, doesn't the fact China JUST abstained from demanding Russia leave really admit how they feel in action re: territorial integrity? Actions speak louder than words.
