Sherriffs are like the mid point between local cops and State Police. A cop in one village or city won’t have jurisdiction in another city, they may get some deference in emergencies but they don’t get to supercede the authority of the ones deployed in certain jurisdiction.
State Police handle State wide matters, and have jurisdiction over entire State, they usually handle the issues on the highways and fugitive hunting etc.
Sherriffs are County Wide, they have jurisdiction over the entire county, all the villages and cities and Townships and unincorporated lands within that County. All the people arrested by local cops get sent to the County jails maintained by Sheriffs.
Sheriffs are usually elected and work for the County they are sheriffs of. Deputy sheriffs work under the elected sheriff and the county and are unelected.
Supposedly (not sure how true it is) a sheriff is the highest elected office in some counties. They can’t be touched because they are elected. The only person who can arrest the sheriff is the county coroner. It might depend state by state or county by county how accurate that is though!
