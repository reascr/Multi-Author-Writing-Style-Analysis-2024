If these allegations are true then he's definitely a liability to Lula's government, especially since they've just voted out a party whose supporters were calling for a military coup. The army should not be interfering with police and other domestic operations, period.
A better way to think of the Military Police is militarized police, in that they are organized (as you said) and equipped more like a military, but still function as a domestic peace-keeping police force.
Military Police are somewhat similar to the National Guard in the US, in that they report to the State Governor (but in the US they can also be nationalized and fall under the command of the Federal Army).
You'd call up the National Guard first in the US, which is not strictly the Army and is still technically a domestic peace-keeping force under the command of each State governor. It is somewhat similar to the Brazilian Military Police.
American policing is much more localized than Brazilian. In Brazil the local cops are closer to city security guards. Which most Americans would probably support. The Military Police are under the State and local government has only "diplomatic" control over them. Americans would riot.
