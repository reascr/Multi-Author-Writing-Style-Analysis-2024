What kills me is the set of conflicting lies that come out. To stick with the metaphor, we ask the child covered in chocolate whether they ate the cake, and they say "I didn't even know there was cake! And also, I saw the cat eat the cake. And also also, I wanted the cake, sure, because who wouldn't, but it was already gone before I could even eat any, so who's to say whether I should be punished for eating it since I didn't even get the opportunity to misbehave. Other people eat cake all the time anyway, so if I had eaten the cake, and I didn't, then that would've been okay too. Anyway, somebody drank all the milk to wash down the cake, but nobody's talking about the milk.".
Soo…. We need to tackle the issue here: people who shouldn’t own any firearms at all… not the weapons themselves.
I mean the argument is that they are so dangerous they can't have guns but also not dangerous enough to lock up?
This isn't to diminish the seriousness of gun crime in this country or an argument against gun control, but rather how I see the fallout from any such push.
I'm relatively agnostic on the subject of guns (though not without some strong opinions) and my personal take is that this could cause a lot of harm to a lot of people who don't deserve it, and could backfire against middle of the road Democrats. This could have the fallout of causing deeper divisions and political polarization, and shift centrist voters back towards the right.
