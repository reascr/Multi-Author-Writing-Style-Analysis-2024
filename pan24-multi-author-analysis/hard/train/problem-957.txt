Airline seats in economy are too small, that is just a fact. If you have ever sat next to an obese person and they insist on pulling the armrest up so they can fit it’s even worse. I feel sorry for them but, hell, I payed for my seat and to have it be even smaller because their body is spilling into my seat is just not acceptable.
yeah I'm not even arguing about safety or what, it's just that I paid for my seat and anything crossing into my space is at my discretion. I would probably let you take the armrest if you're big, but I'm not giving you any of my air space or let your leg touch my leg for the duration of the flight.
It’s not discrimination any more than me being 6’6” and flying means I need to make sure I fit in the seat and can get in and out and allow others to get by me.
If I cannot climb over someone who is too obese to move to use the bathroom or they are in a seat that makes it unable for them or me to adequately move during a long flight, then yes, it’s a health and safety issue.
When the physical space for a person encroaches on the safety regulations in an aircraft passenger seat making someone’s safe usage of that space impossible, it is indeed a safety and health issue.
Outlining its policy, Qatar Airways said any passenger “who impedes upon the space of a fellow traveller and cannot secure their seatbelt or lower their armrests may be required to purchase an additional seat both as a safety precaution and for the comfort and safety of all passengers,”.
