Republicans leaders might be getting blackmailed by someone who is getting blackmailed by Putin. Republicans are just getting used for their gullibility and ignorance to right and wrong.
Equating those two things is so mind numbingly ridiculous I still can't believe there are Americans as dumb as she is that votes for people like this.
They also would also vote for Democrats do instead of idiots who blow the entire budget on PR stunts. Like the wall, child care from splitting children from their parents, and unnecessary detainments of people waiting for an immigration hearing.
Deportations decreased significantly during the Trump presidency while illegal immigration increased significantly. He was just so incompetent and ineffectual he made illegal immigration significantly worse.
He blew the entire budget on stupid ineffectual shit like the wall and unnecessary (and expensive) detainments.
Which is especially funny considering deportations decreased and illegal immigration increased under Trump, if you look at the actual numbers.
