Tell us again how urban riots protesting police murders of US citizens equates to insurrectionists taking over the Capitol in an attempt to subvert the peaceful transition of power to a president elected rightfully through the will of the people?
You're trying really hard to equate social justice protests, with millions of participants over months, to a singular attempt by white nationalists, accelerationists, and traitors to seize control of our nation's Capitol while demanding the overturning of the 2020 election and the reinstatement of Trump as President.
In other words, you're comparing a civil rights movement to a fascist coup d'etat. But by all means, proceed with your "it's your fault for making me hurt you" rhetoric - I guess "TheFascistAltRightGenX" would be a more off-putting username for you, as fitting as it is.
So, your takeaway is "context is meaningless" - a common sentiment among conservatives trying to justify fascism.
I suppose you would consider a murder and a self-defense killing to be equivalent - after all, "the specific cause is inconsequential". Or a defensive war as being equivalent to an invasion - both are war, right?
