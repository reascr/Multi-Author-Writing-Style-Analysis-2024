It's silly anyway. The "doctr" in "indoctrination" is the same root word as "doctor". It's from the Latin "docere", or "to teach". "Doctrine" is "what is taught", and "indoctrination" is teaching it to them/convincing them to believe it.
Which also means that by definition, anyone who's calling a lesson you agree with "indoctrination" is planning to do something you'd call "indoctrination" instead. It's just "wroneach", for want of a better word. And this debate is just the left and right screeching it at each other over how education impacts the youth vote.
The fact that you and I agree with one doesn't make it less partisan. Especially as we're probably both left wing.
But seriously, "indoctrination" is just the newest buzz word to a 50 year old war about education that really started with desegregation and evolution.
"Indoctrination" is a buzzword created by the right wing (their accusations are always admissions) to attack education and institute their ideology. Institutionalizing ideology is by indoctrination.
