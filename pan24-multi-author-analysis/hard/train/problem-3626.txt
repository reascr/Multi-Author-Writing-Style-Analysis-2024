real estate investing under us tax code has taxable deduction for depreciation of the asset / investment . as does equpiment and oil and gas investments.
wrong…..proportionally the real estate investing assets and tax depreciation are a much larger , much more significant portion and strategy than FF&E of industrial or retail businesses. And real estate investors use experts to complete cost segregation studies to allocate portions of the buildings to shorter term depreciable assets ( like hvac systems, electrical conduit and wiring). such work maximizes the annual depreciation deductions. ( which are recaptured as ordinary income on a later tax return in a subsequent sale).
Trump could have filed legally correct tax returns based on the tax code that show tax losses while making economic or cash profit. This is legal under that federal tax code. For example, depreciation of assets can create tax losses.
Well yes, if your business is creating depreciable assets then you’ll have a lot more depreciation. But my point is that most companies will have some form of depreciation, which is tax deductible.
a property can cash flow positive yet because of appropriate and tax code deduction for depreciation . geez.
