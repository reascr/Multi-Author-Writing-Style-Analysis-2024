Indians have a deep mistrust of Americans considering their decades long partnership with Pakistan, their considerable opposition to India's nuclear program, and USA's fuck up in West Asia (especially in regards to Afghanistan).
USA: Used to have bad relations with India due to support of Pakistan in its wars against India, but recently, there’s been a massive uptick in relations between India and the US, especially in the military sector. Even during this period of “support” for Russia. And as India develops, the India and the US (and the rest of the west) will only continue to grow stronger ties. Also, in this article, the US is seen as the second most friendly nation, very close behind Russia.
Russia is the most blamed, if you look at the figures in the article. NATO and the US are split into two different choices, and the two added up together adds up to a little more than Russia alone. But yeah still clear that Russian propaganda is having an effect here.
Yes but a US-China war is also a threat to India. As that would most likely bring India into a war against China, who is seen as the biggest threat to Indian security. It doesn’t seem like it’s fear of being attacked by the US, but fear of being dragged into a war.
