I think the other issue is that people are looking at an indictment as some kind of finish line. As we saw under Trump the President of the United States can exert their power to remove prosecutors or not pursue further charges.
And none of that matters until the decision is made by them as to whether a former president can be prosecuted. That's the only case they need to intervene in. And they can choose to do it whenever Trump asks. We have to start by stacking the court.
You trust a corrupt power structure to police itself despite its self-interest in perpetuating that corruption.
Those impeachments did absolutely fuckall. None of these cases matter if the SCOTUS decides they don't. There's no consequence coming from the body that was intentionally corrupted to stop that from happening.
Alvin Bragg dropped his because he didn't want to prosecute a former POTUS, which was said explicitly when some of his subordinates resigned last year. You're trusting a system that was intentionally and recently corrupted for the purpose of not prosecuting this person.
