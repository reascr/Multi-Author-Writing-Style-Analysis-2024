Most weather balloons that are very similar to the balloon shot down Monday, usually carry equipment to also report back their position on public channels. If they dont then it is hard to detect them.
But they only discovered how to track them in the past year and only have known about them since 2021. Once they figured how to track them they used SIGNET to trace back previous times balloon fly overs confidently occured.
Balloons are actually very hard to detect on radar due to how high they fly at usually and how the surface usually isnt a major radar signature.
They look like balloons, they move like balloons, I'm not seeing anything that would indicate these are anything other than balloons other than that they aren't just saying they're balloons.
I think balloons are technically inflated, so if it's like a zeppelin style thing it's not technically a balloon?
The whole "interfering with sensors" bit makes me think it's a balloon with a powerful radar reflector or jammers built into it. Basically, in the event of war you'd theoretically float those over enemy airspace and passively fuck up their air defense and communication. No idea why they'd be releasing those now, though.
