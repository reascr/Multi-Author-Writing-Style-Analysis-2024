The filibuster-proof majority Obama had during that time contained pro-life Dems from the South, so there wasn't a chance of easily passing a bill protecting RvW through.
Yeah not sure where they are getting that reading. They basically just said there's no right to abortion in the Constitution. And since there's no federal law governing it, it's now up to the states to decide that.
SCOTUS said in Dobbs: as a matter of constitutional import, ground-floor abortion stuff gets to be decided by the states.
SCOTUS's current stance is that abortion-related issues are a power not withheld from the government by the U.S. Constitution, and that abortion-related rights are similarly not reserved to the people by the same. Further, Dobbs made it EXTREMELY clear that ground-floor abortion restrictions do not involve any area where the federal government can assert supremacy.
"Codifying Roe" directly says: nuh-uh, the feds can swoop in and be in charge of that stuff, actually.
That is the type of law that directly "codifying" Roe would be. That is the federalism problem it presents.
