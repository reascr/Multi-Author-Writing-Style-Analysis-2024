While I am for the EU banning it still is a ridiculous complaint. Trade in hippo teeth is a tiny market in the EU. It is not the EU who is endangering hippos.
Even IF the EU banned the trade, (at the cost of millions in bureaucracy) the effect would do nothing for the poached hippos that go to non EU countries.
The former because the EU argues the actual trade with hippo ivory and other products derived from the animals is not significant enough to warrant a trade ban. Make of that what you will.
As for the latter - it's a joke based on - the first wild brown bear to be sighted in Germany since 170 years, soon to be the first shot brown bear in Germany since 170 years after it snacked on some livestock.
He has a problem that Germany decided to allow hunters to shoot and kill the first bear that entered Germany in 170 years.
The bear attacked and killed pets and livestock, even within villages, and thus was considered a danger.
At least from what i've gathered, hippos are not considered critically endangered, only vulnerable or endangered, this this might technically be the correct choice for the EU.
For hippopotamus amphibious the EU position is negative to move them from Appendix II to Appendix I because.
