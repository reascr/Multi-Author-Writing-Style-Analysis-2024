And if you think that's something, look into all the diverse stuff they developed from wild mustard. Broccoli, cauliflower, brussles sprouts to name just a few.
Brassica oleracea, or wild cabbage is a plant that has been bred into cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, etc. These food crops would be unrecognizable in their wild form.
The anti-GMO crown typically doesnâ€™t understand every food crop we use have been modified for thousands of years through selective breeding and exploiting mutations in the plant.
Not saying GMO crops do all these things too, but focusing only on yields, and using the broadest of definition of GMO, seems disingenuous and an incomplete picture.
This makes me think of the huge misinformation when it comes to GMOs in this thread, or more so the world, and how 99% of people compare genetically modified = genetically engineered. This corn is absolutely engineered by the chemical industry of Monsanto aka Dow. The amount of pesticides is also on the rise if you look at usage reports state by state - the increase of chemicals has been seen as "pests" are finding new ways to adapt. Not to mention all the lawsuits against Glyphosate currently happening which point directly to causation for non-hodgekins lymphoma and other leukemia's.
