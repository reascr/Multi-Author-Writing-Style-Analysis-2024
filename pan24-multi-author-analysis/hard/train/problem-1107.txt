Which is of course vague enough and make believe enough that Russia can say those conditions have/haven't be met whenever they want.
They ought to try and take the few conditions Ukraine is willing to accept before they end up with no conditions left. The unrealistic idea in their heads that Russia will ever retain direct control over any portion of Ukraine proper, by force, needs to die.
Ukraine should be the only ones setting the terms, and I think that letting Russia hand on to its previous ill gotten gains even temporarily sends the wrong message.
One of the risks for Ukraine is a loss of popular support, and it is certainly something that is currently not helping Russia.
Yes, but is also important for Ukraine to keep bringing up, it gives them something to concede to Russia, for example in exchange for captured UA citizens.
People who suggest letting Russia have parts of Ukraine, or that we shouldn't be supplying the equipment Ukraine needs, for fear of escalation or dur to inconveniences caused by Russia are enter knowingly or unknowingly helping Putin.
A lot of the posturing by Putin and his cronies that is intended for consumption outside of Russia is an attempt to make people give up on supporting Ukraine, either by trying to convince people that Ukrainian defeat is inevitable, or that Putin will punish those countries that support Ukraine.
Any punishments also harm Russia, in the same way that sanctions have inconvenienced those imposing the sanctions, but Russia is not nearly in as good a position to absorb these consequences, something that Putin hopes we overlook.
