There are some other possible issues. Chinese subs were a joke 20 years ago, but apparently they've massively improved. No one really knows how successful a hypersonic carrier buster missile is, but after the Ukrainians sunk the Moskva with a missile every naval planner is cautious. We might be to a point where the carrier is as useless in a peer nation conflict as the battleship was after the introduction of the dive bomber.
China doesn't have the transport capacity (yet) to move enough soldiers over to Taiwan to have the slightest chance of holding it. If they dropped everything and declared that they were building nothing but landing boats at all of their shipyards... it still would take more than 2 years to accomplish.
In short, they lack the capacity to do so... RIGHT NOW. It is absolutely in their national inventory of "Stuff we want to do" it is just not something they can do RIGHT NOW.
Don't get me wrong, in the next 10 to 20 years, the US is going to have to make a hard choice about Taiwan, but we aren't there... yet.
Further, I doubt it is going to come to a full military intervention because Taiwan is half way across the globe and... frankly... we are building the key industries that Taiwan has over here. In ten years, China is going to be strong enough to look at the US and tell us that they are taking Taiwan, and we are going to grudgingly hand it over after some concessions. Or we are going to massively (and I mean massively) step up the defensive posture for Taiwan. If people are bucking at what is spent in Ukraine... the amount spent in Taiwan is going to give them all aneurisms.
