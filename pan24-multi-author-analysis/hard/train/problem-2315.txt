It wasn't "made at the barrel of a gun", nor was it to "make room for White settlers". The agreement was negotiated over many years, the tribes had years to move, and no settlers were moved into the area. The tribes and the Georgia citizens could not get along with each other, the tribes could not form an acceptable state that would work within the US Constitution (the tribes were horribly racist and did not care for personal rights of others). The only viable option by both was for the tribes to be further away from US citizens. The majority of the tribe followed the agreement, some stayed as they had no intention of abiding on the agreement and were forced to join those who willingly moved.
FYI, the Trail of Tears was not a "forced relocation", it was an enforcement of a legal agreement. The US government offered the tribes in Georgia to create their own state as part of the US. The tribes created a racist, xenophobic non-democratic oligarch which would not function as a state. So the US offered to purchase the land and give them lands in Oklahoma. The tribes agreed (almost 50-50) and most moved comfortably. The remaining Native Americans refused to leave and refused to return the money. Therefore the US authorized their removal (far too harshly but it is greatly overblow, heck the Native Americans who had moved berated those who had to be moved by force).
UK and US both have a history of forcibly removing locals from their land and subjecting them to genocide, just like how Russia is doing in Ukraine today.
Here, both US and UK have committed a crime by forceful eviction of natives from their own home island so that US can build base without interruption.
