this is one of those things that will die in one news cycle because the left doesn't have a victim complex. If this was "MSNBC shared Trump Ad info with Biden camp" the right would be apoplectic.
Imagine how white hot Fox correspondents would be if it came out CNN officials informed the Biden campaign about Trump ads? Shit, they were already white hot about Biden asking for revenge porn to be taken down from Twitter.
“The Twitter Files” tried to kick up a furor over candidate Biden asking for revenge porn photos of his son to be taken down.
Real world examples: Trans people. Gay people. Drag queens. Migrants. Librarians. Teachers. Every Democratic politician up to and including Biden and Harris. “Woke leftists.”.
Fox News is saying untrue horrible BS about every one of these people/groups all the time, every bit as bad as what they said about Dominion, poisoning their neighbors and communities against them. But maybe it doesn’t rise to the legal threshold of “defamation” because they aren’t attacking one individual directly, they’re spewing their godawful venom about the whole group and we don’t write laws to protect groups of people from collective defamation.
