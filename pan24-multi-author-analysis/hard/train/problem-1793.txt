There is a moral imperative for western nations to arm Ukraine as much as possible so they don’t have to pay too high a price for Russia’s hubris.
Why is giving Ukraine longer range weapons (not just ATACMs but also cruise missiles) a red line, but Russia bombing civilians over and over and over again, isn't?
Not to discount anything, but, given how utterly inept the Russian military is, wouldn't it just be them to engage air defense for fireworks while letting their air bases get wrecked?
Let's consider these losses in the light of russia's already degraded military capabilities. 57 pieces of equipment destroyed on 31.12. is relatively a much bigger blow than 57 pieces destroyed in February. One would think that as russia slowly but surely runs out of everything their losses would likewise naturally decrease.
That they're still suffering devastating losses like this makes it increasingly likely that russia will simply keep destroying their military in Ukraine until there is no more military to destroy. russia is done.
