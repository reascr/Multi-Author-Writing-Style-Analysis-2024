But you can’t just ban heroin and call it a day. You need to help the people who are already addicted, and you need to ameliorate the factors that drive people into addiction in the first place. Because once someone is addicted, the fact that it’s illegal simply doesn’t matter anymore.
(Mind you, improved gun regulation is not a complete solution either. But it’s an important first step, and one that’s long overdue to be taken.).
True. Most American now see that the policies were just an excuse to project American power abroad as well as suppress certain groups at home. But that is just because the internet has given people unfiltered access to information for the first time.
The propaganda my parents generation had to deal with in order to believe that stuff was insane. Constant commercials and news reports about how they are helping people in their own country and other countries. Meanwhile, it was just a distraction by right wing politicians from the real problems.
In a culture where prostitution is normalized like Indonesia, most strait people will either not be reported or the police will not arrest those that are. However, the minority groups like gays are more likely to be reported and more likely for the police to act because they are viewed as different. Same with women because it is a Muslim country and men continue to hold most of the power. My guess is that reporting by “spouse or family” only applies when a woman cheats but not a man.
that being said, if one or both of those consenting adults is already married, arguably the spouse that's getting cheated on is the victim (your mileage may vary).
