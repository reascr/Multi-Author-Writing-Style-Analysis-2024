Afaik prison recruits are thrown straight at the front as cannon fodderâ€”it's not like they get years of training the rest of the Wagner group have. This is from reports in Russian.
A good example here is Russia. Russia is not becoming poorer and poorer under Putin, it is more like stagnant. But in a world were every other economy is slowly growing, that is the same as becoming poorer. In 2013 the Russian Economy was slighter larger than the economy of Italy. Today the economy of Italy is 50% larger than the economy of Russia.
Hitler could focus German economy and industry towards building a bigger army than any german president would be able to find public support for. At the start of the war Germany had relative good generals and well trained soldiers, but this is not because of Hitler or the nazis. The german generals that fought and wins the first part of the war were not trained by nazi Germany. They were not promoted during nazi Germany. They had been trained and promoted during the German Empire and the following Weimar Republic. They were good, not because Nazi Germany had made them, but because Nazi Germany had not destroyed them yet.
Had Hitler wait 10-20 years with starting WWII, then most of them would properly had lost their jobs or been killed for not being loyal enough and the army would have been much worse than it was in 1939. Because autocracies destroyes the good institutions they inheriates from democracies.
It's a byproduct of authoritarianism. Because of the fear-based command structure and power resting with particular people rather than institutions, ass-kissing and lying ensues. It results in a toxic command culture where no one cooperates, sometimes withholding information or resources because they want to undermine a rival. It is detrimental to the group as a whole.
