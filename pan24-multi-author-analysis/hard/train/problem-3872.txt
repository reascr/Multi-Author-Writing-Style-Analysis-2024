He has done a lot of good too. His major fuckup imho is not supporting the train strikers for sick leave.
He is far from a 90s republican. Did you even grow up in the 90s? Biden isnt hooked on opioids, hookers or boys to be a 90s GOP member.
Really though, Biden at least seems to be healthy for his age. Trump is a known McDonald's frequenter. Biden probably suffers from some brain deficiency caused by old age, but today's technology and well-trained aides and staff probably make up for that. Biden is cognitively stable and active; Trump is only a few years younger, is overconfident and doesn't care about his own health. If Biden has to pass along his duties at least temporarily, we have VP Harris for that.
Sane old guy with maybe some brain issues but with a good backup plan vs a whackass old man who caters to the Christian taliban and denies science. Biden is better.
Biden is doing a good job but hes just too old. So is Bernie. So is trump. There must be a younger and equally effective candidate on the democrats side who can pick up and run with things & shut up all the magas who scream about senility being bad when its Joe but ok with its trump.
I have a feeling the Republicans are going to pick someone like DeSantis, whose national campaign is going to be about drag shows and bathrooms, and I think we saw in the past three national elections, people don't really give a shit about that. Let's cross our fingers this will be another 2012 where the incumbent mostly just cakewalks into re-election.
I'm ok with this. I think Biden did very well against Trump in 2020 because it's hard to hate the guy. You can't make stuff up very well and make it stick (for people who aren't already biased against him), and anything that was going to come out about him already happened decades ago.
