I saw something the other day that it is now cheaper in the US to build new wind and solar (with the gridscale batteries needed to grid balance) than it is to keep operating existing coal plants.
wind and solar installations also create a larger number of long lasting decent paying jobs over a larger geographically distributed area.
True, but the statement before is that operating the existing plants costs more than solar and wind investment. Also US just approved plans for small modular nuclear plants that may take less investment and time. Looking forward to the developments forthcoming in the nuclear field.
I think you are well aware of the difference between nuclear warheads and the process of obtaining power from nuclear material. If not, please go educate yourself. They aren’t trying to figure out how to make power, they are trying to make themselves a world power with nuclear arms. The government has proven that they can’t even be trusted with the well being of their population, let alone the population of a country that isn’t their own.
