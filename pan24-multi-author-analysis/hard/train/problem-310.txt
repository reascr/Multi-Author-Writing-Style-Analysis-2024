Republicans are hostile to things that are very important to young people, like climate change, and reproductive rights, and acceptance of marginalized groups.
Republicans already fear the blacks, the foreigners, the fairer sex, the differently able, adding the young to the list doesn't seem like that far a leap.
I've been hearing that the GOP fears the young since I started voting almost 20 years ago, just to watch voter turnout in the younger age groups be utter shit. On top of that, I think there is a significantly underestimated shift in youth political opinions towards conservatism, and social conservatism in particular. The liberal youth tend to be much more outspoken, so everybody takes them to be much more representative of that age group, but I think there is a growing number of very conservative kids coming up and getting ready to enter voting age.
Polling doesn't back that up, boomers lean to the right at basically the same percentage as they did when they were the youngest voting block, same with gen X, and millennials actually lean further to the left now than when they were younger lol. The simple explanation for this is that the leftward lean of current generations is more to do with current generations being less white, and less lead poisoned, than the older generations. And minorities tend to lean to the left much more than white voters. So unless the GOP does a major 180 on their racism they won't be gaining much ground with millennials, gen Z, and gen A.
It is overall more complex than that on an individual basis, but it is a fact that every minority demographic currently leans to the left, some more dramatically than others, and it is also a fact that the millennials and younger generations have significantly more minorities than baby boomers and gen X did. It's not the entire reason, but it does play a big part along with more college education, growing up in more diverse settings, and more wealth inequality.
