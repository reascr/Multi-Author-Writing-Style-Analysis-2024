Andrzej Duda, President of Poland, has said that he understands the position of his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that Ukraine was not responsible for the missile that landed in the village of Przewodów, Poland, killing two people on Tuesday, 15 November.
Previously: On 16 November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was convinced that the missile that landed in Poland on Tuesday, 15 November, was not Ukrainian.
Interception missed/lost track/whatever and the missile missed might have gotten hit by another interception rocket or it might have hit the target in Ukraine.
There's a crater and missile debris, the blame has to head somewhere, and if the debris indicates Russian missile but the goal is to avoid escalation, they'd have to put it on Ukraine.
There are almost no scenarios where the missile landing in Poland was intentional no matter the source, and intentions would be a very big part of determining the type of response.
Details: The Polish president said that Zelenskyy’s claim that the missile that landed in Poland was not a Ukrainian missile is based on the fact that "everyone wants to see the evidence they want to see.".
