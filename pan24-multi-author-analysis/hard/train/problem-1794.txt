The reason why the threat of court packing worked with FDR was because he was overwhelmingly popular in the country and enjoyed a great deal of support in congress.
dont get me wrong i think we are long overdue having more justices given how many court circuits we have, but i honestly dont have much confidence in it happening.
There are compelling legal arguments that have been made that judges appointed to the Supreme Court can be rotated back to the circuit courts, and don't have to sit on the high court forever.
Can't force them to resign as federal judges without a constitutional amendments, BUT I have heard various experts float the idea of simply rotating them back down to a lower court.
While this amicus brief by one of the creators of the law will be useful, it's questionable how much the courts will care that a democratic lawmaker is filing a brief in defense of a democratic president.
2)No one can bring a lawsuit to prove it's illegal because they can't show it's being harmed by the illegal act.
3)These states are using the excuse that their loans are being paid off by this order so they are being harmed by it.
It's not really a matter of they win the lawsuit by showing that the loans getting paid off affects them negatively. They only gain the right to sue. In order to win the lawsuit, they still have to prove that the loan repayment order is illegal. Basically they have to prove that Biden is wrongly authority granted to his administration by the HEROES act of 2003 and as such he has no authority granted to him by congress to forgive these loans.
