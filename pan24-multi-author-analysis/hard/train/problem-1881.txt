Conservatives reeeeeaally want to reverse course on LGBTQ acceptance. They got thrashed in the midterms but a lot of them are still doubling down and pushing this idea that LGBTQ people are the source of all problems in the nation now. Itâ€™s pretty horrifying as a gay guy. This is exactly the kind of obsessive hate that leads to things like the Holocaust. The way conservatives have been acting has erased any doubt I had that a significant portion of this country wants to make that happen for us.
It is on the bigot to change their life and hide themselves away from society if they cannot tolerate all parts of society. Not on the minority they hate.
I think the point we are trying to make is that being LGBTQ is a fine state of being to have. If your kids turn out to be LGBTQ that's fine. Us existing in public isn't some existential threat to society and we don't need permission to exist in society.
If other people are offended by our open existence in society in full view of everyone just like straight people are then that is really more their problem than it is ours.
Can we stop perpetuating the idea that only closeted people are homophobic? It shifts the blame for the violence towards the LGBT community onto LGBT people themselves.
I know the LGBTQ community has always faced discrimination from the right, but what was the catalyst in the last few months/years that brought out much much aggressive protests and violence? Was it just the 'mainstreaming' of the Proud Boys and other groups on the right over the dragshows? I feel out of the loop on some events that took place.
