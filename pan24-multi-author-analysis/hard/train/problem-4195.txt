Mr. Gaetz went so far on Tuesday night as to write the Architect of the Capitol, demanding to know why Mr. McCarthy had been allowed to move into the speaker’s office.
“How long will he remain there before he is considered a squatter?” Mr. Gaetz wrote. “Please write back promptly as it seems Mr. McCarthy can no longer be considered speaker-designate following today’s balloting.”.
Hasn't McCarthy already moved into the House Speaker's office...even though he hasn't been elected to that position yet?
Within the year, Kevin McCarthy will wish he'd rather been caught in a nasty scandal and resigned than become the Speaker of a marginal Republican House.
Yes, Kevin McCarthy has sucked more dick and taken it up the ass more than anyone who was a candidate for speaker. He’s sold his soul and is the very embodiment of corrupt Republican’t politics. What’s hilarious is that it is the bat shit crazy caucus that is holding him for ransom. I’m sure he’s thinking, “Strike me down, and your journey to the dark side will be complete.”.
