What looks odd from a European or North American perspective is that even the business lobby keidanren is saying “we have to increase wages”. Not something you would usually expect from a business lobby.
Of course. Employees receiving wages are consumers and wage increases increase their disposable income. That means they can buy more which increases the demand for goods and services. Companies get more optimistic about the future and invest in the business (facilities, technology, people) and hire more people. More demand for people means wages go up further increasing the disposable income and the virtuous cycle continues.
Inflation is an increase in money supply without an increase in output, profits are high as a result of inflation not the cause.
Or are you suggesting that companies have only now been able to raise prices for some unknown reason.
What is happening right now is that some companies are arbitrarily raising their prices in an attempt to make more profit. This is causing a ripple effect where other companies reliant on these first companies are also raising heir prices, and so on and so forth.
This can look like inflation to the untrained eye. And the companies who are arbitrarily increasing their price want you to believe it is inflation and not greed.
Inflation is an increase in prices, which can have multiple sources. If this wave of inflation was due to currency devaluation from money being printed during the pandemic (which is the main source of 'increase in money supply', then profits would not be going up this much; they would be keeping up with inflation.
