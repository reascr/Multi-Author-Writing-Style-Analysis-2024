Only for those with their eyes purposefully shut isn't already obvious that the only way to actually end the war with Russia (as opposed to a temporary suspention until Russia has determined they're ready again and invades some more) is to defeat them so hard that they can't actually attack again.
Wipping out as much as possible of the current generation of men which Russia is sending to fight weakens today's AND tomorrow's Russia and makes is far less likely they'll try this shit again, now or in the coming decades, once defeated.
It's sad but it's not in Ukraine's hands to reform Russia into a normal country so all that it has left to stop it's neighbour's barbaric ways is to kill as many of them as they send.
That may or may not be true, I still think that if a surrender was offered that gave Ukraine back its territory but allowed Russia to extricate its remaining forces that Ukraine would take it.
Hopefully we can keep our mettle and treat Russia as a pariah state for some time too, which would also slow their accumulation of force.
If it wasn’t for MAD I would be advocation NATO boots on the way to Moscow, but MAD is a factor so we just have to do what we can….
And NATO needs to be ready to act in retaliation if nukes are used or Russia does more shit on NATO soil.
Russia's military and political system can be destroyed without the use of nukes in a "World Vs Russia" scenario.
It would be a disaster for the civilian populations, but if the other side is using nukes warcrimes might have to be committed to take that power.
Blow up infrastructure, take out political and military leadership, shoot down nukes in the air, gas's/biological weapons, anything to prevent more nukes from going off.
