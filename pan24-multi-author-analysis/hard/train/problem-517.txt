Don't forget that in 1945, the world's sovereign nations numbered about 60 or so, with vast swaths of the world part of European empires. When you take the combined USSR, USA, British Empire (including the dominions), French Empire and China, in 1945 the 5 permanent members of the security council represented the vast majority of the world's population and economy, and virtually 100% of its military power.
The UN was created to build a new world order that placed the victors of the war in the 5 permanent security council seats, something that hasn't changed despite being obsolete...it has nothing to do with preventing nuclear war.
The UN is a diplomatic forum for representaties of all the world's nations, it was created because so future world wars could be prevented, not to install a new world order.
The nations of the world had very little say in its formation, although that isn't to say they opposed it - obviously they didn't - but in 1945 "the world" was basically Washinon DC, London and Moscow, with Paris and Beijing being honorary members.
The UN was created in 1945, a decade before before thermonuclear weapons were invented and at a time when only a handful of atomic bombs existed, all of them American.
