The party voted at their convention to endorse McMullin over , who was trying to make it a D vs. R vs. I race. Arizona parties don't use conventions to nominate, so if someone files as a Democrat and gets enough ballot qualification signatures they'll be on the primary ballot and will win the nomination, even if the party as an organization nominally doesn't want to do that (although from everything state party leaders here are putting out, and from the signaled interest in the seat by both Gallego and Stanton, they don't look like they'd have wanted that anyway).
No candidate who actually wants a political future will file to run against the wishes of the party and the signature requirements to get on the ballot seem kinda low actually but are probably still enough to keep just any swingin dick off the street from running as a Democrat without some kind of funding/organizational support.
And yes, my entire point was that the party can exert soft power to keep Democrats off the ballot if they wanted but they probably wouldn’t because Republicans would run a ghost candidate Dem as a spoiler.
So the party could theoretically use some soft power shit to keep a Dem from running, but then I’d be worried about Republicans backing some nutjob to run unopposed in a Dem primary as a spoiler for the general.
I think if she had switched to Independent and also said she was going to caucus with the Republicans, which would have forced the power sharing agreement, she would lose all her committee assignments. That and the death threats she would probably see helped nuance her choice.
