It’s not a question of what’s fair. You claimed banks would refuse to issue student loans if they were dischargeable in bankruptcy because they aren’t collateralized. This is false. You don’t seem to have a solid grasp of what you’re talking about, so you’re changing the subject to what’s fair for taxpayers.
Bullshit. Student loans are federally guaranteed. If a student defaults, the government is on the hook to repay the lender. Banks don’t need to collateralize student loans. Prior to 2005 student debt was dischargeable in bankruptcy, yet somehow, banks were still comfortable issuing loans to students without collateral.
That way the borrower never gets into a situation where their balance 10 years after graduating is literally more than the loan they initially took out.
IMO the more responsible thing would be to have each degree have to specify earnings of graduates and how long it would take students to pay back loans based on that. Offering expensive degrees that offer no prospect of being able to pay it back is unethical.
Eventually. Colleges have massive costs, and they'd need to cut them - that means mass firings, no new facilities, etc. etc.
