If only there'd been 6 visible planets instead of 5. Then we'd have 8 day weeks and could split things evenly.
I did 4 tens for about 10 years, and recently went back to 5x8s. The weekends are short, but that extra 2 hours after work makes a huge difference in my time off during the weekdays and honestly I'm back to preferring 5x8s.
Beyond how the heck do these companies still manage to compete with such poor labor utilization, how are people not bored out of their minds just sitting there all the time?
I'm really shocked at how people apparently sit around at work so much and companies just... let them get away with it to the point that losing 20% of the labor hours for the week has minimal effect.
Then again, one of the major points regarding shorter work weeks is that many employees aren't doing the 40 hours' worth anyway, as it's too much to ask.
I do actually kinda get the reason for both shorter workweeks & work from home being faught against.
I dont know why people think 4 day work week will mean shorter business hours. Instead, more people can be hired and employed. And there is more incentive to work if you are not working inhumane hours.
Because in this context, they're fighting for more hours of their life at work. Because it's the only place at least some of the people fighting for the preservation of the 40 hour week feel they get to be social.
