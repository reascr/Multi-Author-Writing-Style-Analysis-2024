Seems like someone is abusing their government power by instructing their staff to find evidence against a political opponent they do not like...if only the GOP and their supporters understood simple concepts like irony.
To the bold: This is another standard GOP talking point about "abuse of power", they'll argue everything has to go through Congress no matter how small. This ignores the fact that entities like the FCC, FTC, IRS were created by Congress to manage specific forms of governing (Communications, Trade, Taxes) so Congress isn't bogged down with every little detail. They act as extensions of Congress and the Executive branches. Additionally because of how the House and Senate are currently split right now, any potential new legislation on a bill to get rid of Non-competes which benefits Republicans and big business because the rules will remain the same.
Non-Competes help large corporations by preventing start ups in the fields from popping up and allows them to control ideas their employees may develop while hired by them.
We need an FTC with teeth to protect us from monopolies and more importantly Mega-Corporations from forming and getting larger. If the GOP is all about the free market then they should be happy with getting rid of the non-compete because it means more start ups can take on the big guys in established markets. They'd want to break up Hollywood so there's more studios, etc. But Miss Wilson here doesn't agree with this direction apparently.
And her trying to get rid of noncompetes, with Wilson saying its not part of their authority. Seems she's not the leader so that's not up to her.
