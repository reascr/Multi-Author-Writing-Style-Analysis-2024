Exactly what you'd think--hormone therapy causes the development of secondary sex characteristics common to whichever hormone is being given.
And even then, while there are some permanent effects, discontinuing hormone therapy tends to lead to a slow disappearance of the developed secondary sex characteristics. For example, a transman who has been on testosterone will have experienced facial hair growth, clitoral growth, muscular growth, voice deepening, and fat deposit redistribution (among many other changes). The first two of those are permanent; the latter three tend to wear off.
If you mean "continue their normal puberty," they're taken off the puberty blockers and the body does the rest.
Puberty blockers have been in use since the 80s, with no issues. While they were initially used to treat precocious puberty, it’s the same drugs used for the same purpose (delay puberty), so there’s no reason to assume there would be any new issues.
Trans teens on puberty blockers won’t be on them for more than a year or two in most situations, while they make a decision as to whether to begin hormone therapy or stop blockers and resume their default puberty, so it would be pretty hard (and not very useful) to study its effects over periods of more than a year in this case.
They won’t tell you about the weakened skeletal development, cancer risks, infertility and improper development of secondary sex characteristics that result from puberty blockers should the patient decide to not want to continue down the path of transition.
