Adding a judge every four years would require judges to serve an average of 36 years to have 9 on the court on average. (That's equal to the tenure of the longest serving judge to date.) There are also reasons to think that the court should be bigger than it is now and "every two years" works out to a number of judges in the low to mid teens with recent service times.
3. When there was lots of talk about "court reform" in the media recently, one of the concerns was that there would be a tit-for-tat with each side adding two (or more) seats whenever they took power.
Yeah, I'm right there with you, except that I think it should probably be adding a seat every two years, (say, at the start of May in odd numbered years) and removing a seat whenever a judge stops serving.
2. Court size is set by law, and the size has been changed over the years without a constitutional amendment. (Currently the size is set by the judiciary act of 1869.).
Yes. I think politicians shouldn't be allowed to run after age 65, and judges should have a mandatory retirement age (and I'd say it's whatever the age is for full social security benefits).
