However, after years of the GOPers constantly dangling culture war carrots but not REALLY delivering, Obama happened (in addition to other major culture war losses for them such as gay marriage and a rise in the acceptance and visibility of trans people, even if meagre compared to what it should be), and a lot of the rubes began to--correctly--surmise that the GOPers weren't all in on the culture war stuff, and just used it as a vehicle to pass tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations (not that this bothers them, the culture war stuff is simply paramount to them).
I define the GOPers as the old school party elites. The wealthy businessmen who are at the heart of the Republican party. They are a bunch of largely amoral capital owners who fund think tanks to create propaganda they can sell to the rubes to get them to vote against their own best interests. They know they are liars.
This was around the time the "tea party" started happening (even if a lot of that was astroturfed by right wing Libertarian billionaires). This was the point that the rubes basically started seizing power from the GOPers and electing their own guys into office, who not only spouted the bullshit propaganda lies like the GOPers did, they actually believed this shit.
With the way the GOP media ecosystem operates and the fact their base seems drawn to unrepentant liars, assholes, and idiots, I'm half expecting this whole fiasco to turn into this guy becoming their next "shining star".
Do you really believe that they couldn't find a journalist who wanted to break the "congressional candidate is lying about their whole life, basically" story?
