Nearly every republican politician is like this. Their moral compasses are determined by what will get them elected. It’s why the party literally adopted the “whatever Trump says” platform - that’s what the base wanted, despite how at odds it was with religious conservatism.
Their politicians may not have resembled populists in the past, but that almost certainly changed when Trump got the nomination. I am not sure saying whatever weird thing will get you votes can really be classified as true populism, though.
Now that they are looking at their next election, it's a good example of voters swaying the previously unswayable.
Yes, there's vote counting and strategic voting, but that's more a thing with the party in power beyond the "moderate darlings" that pretend every once in a while.
As for pre-determined, yes, votes are whipped before hand, that has nothing to do with whether or not the senators are voting the way they think.
I’m guessing a number of other Republican Senators would want to come out in support of this, but they can’t without sinking themselves.
