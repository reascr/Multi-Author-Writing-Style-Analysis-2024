Would you really? I quit eating beef and pork for climate reasons and that might be my limit. I still cheat. I don't mind recycling, but supposedly that doesn't really help much. I don't think I'd move if I had a long commute. I'm also living in a much larger house than I need, but again, I don't want to move. Still, it seems like I'm doing more than most people I know. It seems like everyone's car is bigger than mine and they're driving like maniacs. No one else is bringing their own grocery bags. It seems like no one else cares or even thinks about what things are going to be like when climate change gets really bad.
I think we need to stop with the doomsday climate talk. There is real cause to be optimistic about recent events.
I'm actually fairly optimistic about the trajectory we seem to be on. I definitely think we missed our chance to limit warming to under 1.5 degree Celsius, but I think even just a few years ago warming of 4-5 degree Celsius was on the table, but we seem to be on a lower trajectory more like 2-3 degree Celsius.
Yea I'm not arguing there are going to be devastating effects at 2C warming. There absolutely will be.
That's not even strictly true. At this point, it's not about preventing climate change, but mitigating the damage it causes. Any nation making decisive movements in the right direction helps. A unified global effort is just both more effective and spreads the economic damage more evenly.
