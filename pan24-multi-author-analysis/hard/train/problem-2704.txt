Though this study was almost 4 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. I tend to think % support for trans people has decreased since then, especially (but not only) in the UK.
Also doesn't help that politically it's very transphobic, as you can even see with the UK blocking the pro-trans Scottish bill. And that a lot of the outspoken TERFs are from the UK. So it could be true that the common lay-person in the UK is less transphobic than the general EU, but that doesn't translate very well over the internet.
You would honestly think we were one of the most transphobic countries in the world according to many internet spaces, when actually the complete opposite is true.
It's honestly quite baffling to me how the UK has become known as "TERF island" when in reality the data all points to us being very accepting of trans issues. I think there is a lot of misinformation being spread on places like Twitter and reddit by younger people whether intentionally or not.
In this same study, the UK is also the most comfortable when it comes to their child dating a trans person. Yes that's right, more than ANY OTHER European country.
