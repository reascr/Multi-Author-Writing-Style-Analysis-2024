The irony is great. I am curious why the dems haven't reached out to the more reasonable republicans to nominate one of them. The chance to stop the MAGA and crazy legislative slate is pretty much there for the taking.
EDIT\ there are far too many comments to respond to so I will post my one thought about it here. They don't need to nominate an active house member. They can nominate Liz Cheney, they can nominate Bill Gates, they could nominate anyone that they can get 6 republicans to agree on. There may be a few dems that would never nominate a republican but I think there is someone out there that the democrats can partner with 6+ GOP members on to get put in. It would show good faith from dems to vote with some GOP members and it would totally stop the waste of a legislative session by ending the upcoming wasteful "investigations" into the FBI, DOJ, Hunter Biden, Jan 6th committee and any other crazy stupid thing the modern GOP want to go after.
The GOP is dead, when you elect, "loons and whack jobs" into position of authority, they poison minds with idiotic rhetoric, all they want to do is revenge, not governance, this is cesspool politics millions vote for, McCarthy cant let these people win, if he does, he is a fool.
If McCarthy was smart, he'd tell those hardline Republicans that he's got 6 moderate Republicans who'll turncoat and vote for the Democrat and they'll get NONE of their agenda through for the next 2 years.
As a moderate Republican in Congress, or rather, a less crazy one, would you really want to vote for McCarthy after all the concessions? Heâ€™s going to be QAnon property, anyone can make him fold.
