3. The goalkeeping and defense from the Saudis in the 2nd half was extraordinary. I couldn't believe it. I was howling at the TV like a crazy person and I never do that kind of nonsense over sports. It was so unbelievably frustrating.
If an offensive player is closer to the goal than any of the defensive players (besides the goalie), they are in an "offsides" position and they aren't allowed to receive a pass.
In case you don't know what off-side means in soccer: it's when a player makes a forward pass while there are less than 2 players (including keeper) of the opposing team between their goal time and the player being passed to or another player that influences the game through positioning.
That said, as soon as the ball leaves the passing player's body, the offensive player receiving the pass can run forward towards the goal and it's not offsides.
Off side happens when the opposite team player has passed the last player of your team towards your goal before the ball is played to him. If you score from there, its invalid.
