They might be miserable now, but they had two decades when the Western powers were actively attempting nation building, and a huge percentage of them actively supported or provided cover to the Taliban insurgency.
Answer : The People "Rolled Over" Because the Afghan people have been in a constant state of Corrupt Governments, War, Extremist Militants, Poverty, Aerial Bombings and War for over 40 years now.
Statement : "These are not mutually exclusive. You can think going to Afghanistanwas a mistake. You can also hope if your going in there, even if youdisagree with going in there, there’s some success.. You can also beangry that after spending trillions of dollars and blood of yourcitizens, most of the population of 45 Million at bests rolls over foran army that only totals 70k and has no Air Force, and at worst work forthem. Then get more angry when it’s now obviously worse, and peopleare complaining after all your country did.".
Yep. Guess you're right. If it wasn't for the Americans then Afganistan truly could have done something about the Taliban. Well now the Americans are gone. Let's see how the fare on their own.
Dude... the corrupt officers took their money and fled. You can't blame everything on corrupt officials. We all saw the metric fuckton of equipment and fortresses that were left behind. EVERYONE fled. Not just some corrupt officials at the top. When the USA announced a deadline for leaving, and Taliban was on the move, there was a HUGE opportunity for people to say "you know what, it would suck if Taliban came under rule again, we should do something about that". Instead what did we see? People piling onto airplanes or hoping things would be "different" this time.
