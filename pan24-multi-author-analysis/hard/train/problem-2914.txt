Over 50% of Republicans still think Trump won in 2020. There is no such thing as a Republican that's not an extremist. Even if the particular Republican you're voting for gives lip service to moderate views, does that really matter when the entire party is goose stepping in unison behind Donald Trump? Every Republican voter is complicit.
If they voted for Republicans for their state government, aren't they partly responsible (i.e. complicit) for the abysmal voting rights situation in Georgia and the gerrymandered districts that prevent the majority from getting their way?
Some voters in Georgia saw a brain-damaged wife-beating child-abandoning moron running for the Senate and decided to vote for his opposition, but I would be interested to look at their choices down the ballot.
But when Republicans show up in Georgia and vote Democratic and help put Raphael Warnock into office, I guess that “every republican voter is complicit” argument goes out the window. That partisan logic does not do democrats any favors especially in tight races in tight states…..
