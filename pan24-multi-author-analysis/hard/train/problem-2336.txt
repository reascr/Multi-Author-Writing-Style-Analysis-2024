SCOTUS has purposefully adopted a “freedom for religion” position instead of the “freedom from religion” position that has traditionally been held by government.
That has always been the case, but the courts have historically held that in order to guarantee freedom of religion, then religion cannot be visibly presented by the government or else risk being an official endorsement.
Nowadays, the court holds that visible endorsement by the government is permissible so long as all religions can be endorsed equally. The issue though is that with Christianity being the vastly predominant religion, that is the only religion that is often presented.
The only reason this is an issue is that it treads on Christian sensibilities and revs up their tendency to persecution.
While I definitely agree with you, I would like to point out that your arguement is the exact same one religious groups would make in response to some of the other statements in this thread. They would argue that sexuality is a choice (it isn't) and therefore they can refuse service to people that "choose" to associate with certain groups.
Their opinion is that sexuality is a choice, while our scientific system (that sounds awkward, wonder if we have a better term for that) recognizes that sexuality is not a choice. The real question is whether our legal system recognizes that sexuality is not a choice.
Considering we allow for same-sex marriage and other legal protections, it is fair to assume that our legal system recognizes that sexuality is not a choice.
