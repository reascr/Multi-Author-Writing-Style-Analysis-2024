Also public opinion in Germany is shifting a little again, Ukraine always calling for Germany to do something but never calling for the US to do something seems odd.
That too is always the case in politics, but I suspect Germany doesn't want Ukraine to win because that would make going back to old normal order much harder in the future.
I'm not specialist in the matter, but as far as I understand, Germany has to give permission to other countries so they can supply Ukraine with leopards.
Well not a single Leopard-2 operator has asked Germany for a re-export allowance, they all want to keep their tanks but point at Germany that they're not doing enough.
It’s because no other country with Leopards can re-export them without Germany’s permission. So as long as that permission is not forthcoming, people are going to be (correctly) pointing a finger at them.
Obviously the Ukrainians would also like American M1A1 tanks as well, which the US has been reluctant to provide, but they at least have a more reasonable explanation: there is no good infrastructure to maintain them, supply parts and repair them easily in Europe — which there is in abundance for the Leopards — and, from a cost and logistics perspective for Ukraine, it would be much better for them to work with a single main platform rather than a patchwork of Abrams, Challengers and Leopards.
