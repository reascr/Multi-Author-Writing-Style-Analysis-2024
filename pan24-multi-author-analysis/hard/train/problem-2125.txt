A landmine that kicks up and goes off at knee / waist level for an adult, might be chest/head level for a child.
Anti-personnel landmines are designed to wound rather than kill, as a wounded casualty takes up many more resources than a dead body.
Landmines always kill more civilians than military targets. Ukraine knows this. What they're doing here is no different than dropping a bomb on an occupied apartment building, except that the deaths will occur over an extended period of time. There is absolutely no justification for this.
There's literally nothing a landmine can do to protect civilians from missile and bomb attacks. It's absurd on every level to suggest otherwise.
This is an incredibly stupid take. Ukraine leaving landmines lying around to kill their own civilians is no different than Russia doing it. It takes a real piece of shit to openly defend war crimes just because they're committed by the "right side.".
Yes, it is. This war is being funded and supplied mainly by the US and other NATO members. If Ukraine takes money from our pockets and uses it to knowingly kill their own civilians, they deserve to go down right along with Russia. I'd say the same thing if it was my own government doing the same thing here.
