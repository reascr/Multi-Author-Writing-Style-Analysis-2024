While I’m glad the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon gets posted regularly, I do not understand why the same doesn’t happen with Bolivia, whose government has been as destructive as the Bolsonaro administration when it comes to the Bolivian Amazon.
The basic point is that the natural resources of the Amazon rainforest is inherently going to be a temptation for any Brazilian government looking for short-term profit and growth. The idea is to realign the economic incentives by offering access to a substantial fund if they don't start slicing it up.
There's no corruption about this. Lula has a pretty excellent record on protecting the rainforest, this deal was negotiated with Norway by him, and it was suspended by Bolsonaro who decided to tear up the rainforest for profit.
Brazil saw massive progress in conserving the rainforest under Lula before Germany and Norway got involved (and probably is the reason they got involved in the first place).
Norway and Germany are basically compensating Brazil (and other countries with rainforests) for not extracting resources there, and provide aid in protecting it from criminals.
Norway and Germany (who were the primary backers starting the fund together with Brazil) have no leverage over Brazil other than aid. This is how practically all foreign aid works, and unless you gonna start to threaten with invasion or something similar you can't change that.
