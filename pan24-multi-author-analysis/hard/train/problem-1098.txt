It would be a lot better if those African nations were the ones exploiting their own resources and making a profit.
No bodies here even mention that it's up to African nations to choose what's best for themselves. Most Western audience here cries colonialism yet treats African nations like children with no agency of their own, just because they chose China. It's this exact Western colonial mentality that cause African countries to favor China.
Global capitalism from the West and China will still exploit the hell out of Africa regardless, but it will likely be less agregious.
“China has helped Africa to get out of the blackmail of some western countries, which wanted to treat African countries as if they were slaves countries”.
Personally, i'm glad China is more involved in Africa, not because i want them to own it/exploit it (they will try), but because the west/IMF have given them horribly exploitative "deals" for decades. The West has to be more fair in our dealings now to prevent African countries from accepting the many objectively better deals currently offered by the Chinese government.
