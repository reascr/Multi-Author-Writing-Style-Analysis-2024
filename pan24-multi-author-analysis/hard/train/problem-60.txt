It doesn’t keep prison populations small. There are currently about 2,400 prisoners on death row, out of 1.8 million prisoners overall. That’s a drop in the ocean. To keep prison populations small, stop jailing people for trivial offences like marijuana smoking. Free people who are in for such offences. Of course, a system that did that wouldn’t have the death penalty anyway.
Also, there is nothing just about the death penalty. I believe a fair society has a right to punish, it doesn’t have the right to kill (barring war). There are too many variables involved in the death penalty. And having it on the books is too risky. You say it should be used on serial killers, one day, someone may say it should be used on abortion doctors or political protesters.
It doesn’t save money. The amount of legal processes, appeals and layers of jurisdiction that happen before someone is executed involve millions of dollars. Those are absolutely necessary and should not be removed. Keeping someone in prison for life is far cheaper than executing them after a full legal process.
The death penalty saves money, it keeps prison populations small, and it punishes the murderer justly. A life for a life.
Let's just suppose we're talking about serial killers, where there's absolutely no doubt about their guilt.
