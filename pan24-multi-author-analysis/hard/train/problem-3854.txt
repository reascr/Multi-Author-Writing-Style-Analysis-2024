This is bad and weird at the same time. I’m wondering why, when the Trump classified document story broke months ago, every living president didn’t have their offices and residences combed thoroughly for any such files that could have been misplaced, misfiled or mishandled. This crap is SO unnecessary. Neglectful. I realize that the Trump situation is totally different than the Biden one, but it makes me wonder WTH is going on.
Based on what we know, what Biden did was bad, and what Trump did was dramatically and intentionally worse.
No, Trump’s actions were worse because we know that he actively misled and refused to cooperate with the DOJ. We also know he had many, many more documents. Not knowing the specifics contained in each document, I cannot say the materials one has was worth than the other.
Carelessness due to arrogance; and lack of oversight and real consequences. Same reason after the email “scandal” it continues to come out that every other official is sending sensitive information from hotmail accounts.
