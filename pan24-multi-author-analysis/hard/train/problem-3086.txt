One of the problems is that they need ballot signatures for mail in, which leads to thousands of ballots needing to be "cured", which is where the state contacts a voter telling them they can fix their signature. If they just didn't have signature mandates it wouldn't be a problem and you could get a more accurate picture of what's going on.
I'm pretty sure she was down by about 23,000 only two days ago and now she's only down by little under 9,000 with most of the remaining votes coming from Clark and Washoe. 57,000 of the remaining votes are from Clarke, where she is receiving a little over 60% outstanding votes. In today's vote dump from Clarke alone she could pick up 9,000 votes (it's not the whole 57,000), and then there's over 20,000 votes left in Washoe, where she is also picking up 60% of the outstanding votes.
Weird the author says the most out standing votes are from Washoe and Lincoln...like Washoe has 165k voters with 14% still to be counted and Lincoln has less then 2k, and has 21% left. Like why are you even mentioning those two counties in the same breath as though they are comparable. Shit, the 7% left in Clark is probably more than what we can expect in Lincoln.
