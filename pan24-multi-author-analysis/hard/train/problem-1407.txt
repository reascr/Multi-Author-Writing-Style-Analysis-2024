Without comparative reference, this is a worthless number. How many non-journalists were killed in the last 20 years? Is the probability of getting killed higher as a journalist or non-journalist?
Though there aren't a lot of journalists so percentages have got to be high. I bet there are more miners or construction workers or oil rig crews than journos.
I do mean proper journalists, not talking heads and all that. The ones who do the work that is then ripped off by 5k clickbait sites and badly misquoted. News hosts can be journalists and often are former ones but often not.
Most of the journalists aren't putting their lives on line, most of the journalists ignore important and relevant News and pump out cheap news that gets clicks/retweets. Journalists and editors are also responsible for curating news, manipulating story, pumping out headlines that grab attention and distorts the truth.
Most of the journalists, are too busy selecting news that fit their readers viewpoints, using their wild imagination to create headlines, use all of their education to pump in opinions in news, all to get more clicks/retweets/subscription.
Yep. News media constantly pat itself on the back, and take glory from a tiny portion of journalists that take actual risks and paints the entire industry with the glory of their work.
News media OTOH, keeps on praising itself and hyping up any risks the organizations or journalists take to raise their profile. My sympathy is with the journalists that are actually reporting from the dangerous areas (war zones, jihadi and extremists camps), not with the most of the journalists that live in safe city pumping out cheap headlines.
