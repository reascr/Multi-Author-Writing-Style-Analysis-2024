My understanding is they are asserting some ballots weren’t tallied properly because of machine errors? And instead of correcting the error poll workers placed the ‘uncounted’ ballots in with ballots that were already counted properly?
There's an allegation by the GOP that in at least two instances, ballots in these secured holding bins were "co-mingled" with already electronically tabulated ballots. Maricopa County seems to acknowledge that this happened, but states that they have a procedure for un-mingling these ballots accurately.
Maricopa County, like most places, uses "mark-sense" ballots. These are the "fill in the bubble" ballots, sometimes referred to by the trademarked name "Scantron." (Ironically, Scantron doesn't produce any election equipment that I'm aware of. They produce a similar type of mark-sense equipment that tabulates things like educational standardized testing.).
These ballots are automatically tabulated by an electronic reader, which requires the use of what are called "timing marks" along the edges of the paper ballots to be properly read. A problem with some of the ballots caused the timing marks not to be printed dark enough for the ballot reader to sense those marks.
While this was going on, voters had the option to either go to another precinct to vote, or they could place their ballots into a secured bin where a much beefier reader back at a central location would then tabulate the ballots.
