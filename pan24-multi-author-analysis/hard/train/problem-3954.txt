Problem for now though is that Putin is actually in a very upscale and isolated bunker, opposed to Hitler's damp and cramped concrete bunker in the middle of Berlin.
I could be wrong, but this is what I remember reading/watching. I personally feel that Putin will probably experience some sort of mental breakdown before there is an actual physical threat from outsiders.
Putin is in the middle of nowhere with everything he can physically need, so his discomfort will take longer to reflect reality.
Yes, good point. I also wonder if since Putin can stay protected for longer, that a physical illness or assassination attempt could end him too.
Mental breakdown on Putin's part is probably what will happen unlike Hitler who put bullet in his temple.
I doubt Putin is spending much time above ground these days. Bombing the Kremlin would wreck an architectural icon and serve to galvanize the Russian people. I don't think it would further disrupt Russia's war effort in any way.
There’s an out for Russia but I don’t think there will s an out for Putin. Ukraine is determined to fight until they get back all there land including Crimea. There is just no way for Putin to survive that politically, either by a direct defeat or pulling out.
