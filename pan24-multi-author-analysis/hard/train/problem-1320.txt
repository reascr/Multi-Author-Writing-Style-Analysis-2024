You don't mock his weight because he's fat. You mock his weight because medical professionals are willing to trash their own reputations to proclaim how healthy he is to stroke his vanity.
Perhaps it would be better to directly call out those physicians (or, rather, the opinions they gave) than to simply mock trump for being overweight. That way, you can make your point—that he’s not healthy even if some sycophantic physician supposedly said he was—without indirectly mocking all overweight people.
When I tried to ask people to find a more meaningful critique (without the potential for friendly fire), I got a bunch of comments basically telling me that most or all “fat people” are responsible for the state they are in. In fact, this may not be the case, and it definitely isn’t for a nontrivial number. In my case, I was misdiagnosed with a psychotic disorder (psychiatrist later withdrew the diagnosis) and was extremely heavily medicated. Unfortunately, those meds made it completely impossible to lose weight—even if I ate just 600 calories and walked a few miles each day.
1000%. I absolutely despise trump, but people had a lot of fun mocking his weight. At the time that was popular, I weighed nearly 190 pounds. Those comments got to me.
I now weigh 130-ish, thanks to the blind luck of having had an unusually competent psychiatrist who was willing to admit their errors. Plenty of other people didn’t get as lucky with whatever the cause of their own weight problems (oftentimes, poverty is a major component…other times, metabolic disorder or severe psychological trauma).
He’s clearly not healthy. Mocking his weight won’t convince republicans that he’s unhealthy, and it won’t change the minds of dems who already figured out that he isn’t.
I’ll get downvoted, but he obviously has mental health issues and I don’t like how Republicans and the media are exploiting him.
