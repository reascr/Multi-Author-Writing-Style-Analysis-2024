Sometimes I'd like to. Given Biden's age and her popularity level among the base, if anything happens to him I'm sure the Party would like to as well.
Biden hasn’t forgotten but there are a portion of people who would like to and we know who they are….
There is historic significance to Kamala Harris’ position as VP, not to mention she is actually VP in addition to that historic significance. Idk why you are having this problem but this is one of the questions we ask in assessing mental status because VP is not some obscure position in the US. Moreover VP Harris’ place in history is also not obscure. It might be worth talking to your PMD unless there is something about VP Harris, different from every other VP, that affects you. Either way it seems to be a you problem.
I guess we should say that about all the losers. That aside, VP Harris is the VP. She is also the first woman and first black woman to hold that position and that is neither a place or time. And yes, Biden running with someone that looked like me greatly influenced my vote for him. Also not a place or time and she was qualified.
