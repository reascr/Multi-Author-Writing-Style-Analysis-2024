I’m genuinely fucking tired of articles like this. One side peddles in sedition, fear, and blatant misinformation. Their supporters give zero fucks what Democrats say or do. You counter their lies with facts and they just ignore it. Just look at the Pelosi attack.
If after all that’s happened the last several years we can’t garner enough support to not vote for literal fucking crazies, then we deserve it.
It is a problem as old as time - the Dems are going to argue about the best way to help people and the GOP are going to scream "NO!" about literally anything the Dems propose.
The Dems are then forced to get even more support, dragging things out, and adding more time for the party to split and special interests to do their dark work.
Depends on the industry, things were slowly ramping back right after the war, but it was on the back of US money so even once Europe started being a producer again they were still heavily dependent on US money and US raw goods.
Legislation is complicated. Even popular laws have to work within a rat's next of existing laws and procedures and it takes time to properly study and implement them.
You wait eagerly for the laws you want to be passed and 2 years go by, maybe 4 years go by, and still nothing. Are you going to pay enough attention to know it was GOP fuckery that caused the bill to fail or are you going to think "I voted for that jackass 4 years ago, he hasn't done shit, I'm going to vote for someone else.".
