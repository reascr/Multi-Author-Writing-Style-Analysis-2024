This is a good thing to remember. Ultimately, the biggest thing that has kept Ukraine free has been the willingness of its people to fight. Russia has about five times the militarily-fit population as Ukraine, but those numbers only matter if mobilization rates are similar. I would be willing to bet that Russia expected that Ukraine would get American guns (they have first hand experience with that right from their own history after all), but I doubt very much that they ever expected the Ukrainian population would participate in a 18 - 60 year-old male draft. The fact that so many Ukrainians were willing to fight is the biggest reason why they are still there today.
I think this is shortsighted; in a war with China, the only reason fighting would happen near the mainland would be because the USN expects to win it handedly. Blockades thousands of miles away from any Chinese land, like in the strait of Malacca, would cripple their ability to fight via a lack of fuel, as well as their economy as a whole. Taiwan is, of course, an important piece of land to consider, however I am unconvinced that the PRC could take it in a timely manner even if the USN refused any major engagements in nearby waters.
I'm not saying Taiwan wouldn't experience an invasion (I think the Navy wargamed it and found we couldn't respond fast enough to stop a landing), but the Chinese navy's chances of survival are slim.
The biggest way to shred this paper tiger is to remember that we have 11 carrier groups with 1 already deployed to Japan. That's basically 11 medium-sized country navies + an air force.
