Even with this legislation in place, if the Supreme Court overturns Obergefell it sounds like states could still make life hell for LGBT people in a lot of ways. Like, if they got married in a blue state and then moved to a red state that didn't recognize their marriage, they'd probably have to file state taxes individually.
Also, I'm pretty sure like basically all laws regulating adoptions and child custody are state level laws and I think bans on LGBT adoption were only struck down because of Obergefell, so that could be a problem this legislation doesn't address.

That's only because the bill will still allow Utah to ban same-sex marriage in the state even though they would have to recognize marriages from other states.
I mean, the Mormons (a big part of why you couldnâ€™t be openly gay in the Boy Scouts for so long) just came out in favor of same-sex marriage recognition. At this point, you gotta be pretty far to the right to choose this hill to die on.
