I saw the same thing in "boat parade" country, went from like 80% trump flags, to 25% after Jan 6...now there are 0 and a smattering of Desantis flags. Might still be enough to win a primary, but the rabid popularity is gone.
No, the breaking point is the realization he's (probably) unelectable and causing them to lose other elections. They don't care about the antisemitism, it's a useful excuse.

In NJ, the entire hasidic community forces one another to go out and vote together for GOP candidates because of their shady mob-money "business" practices, and their Anti-Intellectualism, anti-science, anti-woman cultural narrative...They vote for Nazis because it is good for their finances and control mechanisms...let that sink in.
It's an excuse to seem as though they're morality has improved but in the end...they're just going to vote for whomever promises that they will be financially taken care of...even after everything they're not...and the end result is they're "taken care of" physically.
