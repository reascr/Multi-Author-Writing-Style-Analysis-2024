I skimmed the article, but where is it mentioned pilots are being trained? Edit: I saw the summary, ok so 50 that could start training..
Pretty sure that any B-61 placement is clearly of the table. Of course there's a significant difference between 'generation' of F-16s, that was the basis of my question. The whole 'let's put some modern jets on the table' discussion is understandable, but I still do not think they are such a game changer in thus stage of the conflict. Honesty, the Leopards will be more effective.
Here I disagree. With the sam threat no one is sending out their jets at high altitude to perform air to air. Best case would be firing aim120s on some of the Russian stuff firing cruise missles, but don't think they get cleared to hit them in Belarusian /Russian airspace.
Both Ukrainian F-16s and any Russian airframes flying at medium or higher altitudes are going to get shot down by air defenses.
So all things considered, Russian pilots will be fighting for their fucking lives, if Ukraine got western aircraft.
Yep, and that was the case BEFORE all the pilot losses they've taken over the last year of war in Ukraine...
If you think Ukraine and Russia are in some “Battle of Britain” style air to air fight then you need to dig deeper into the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine is in no position to engage in an air defense suppression campaign. Plus that would mean sending NATO airframes inside Russian border. It is not happening.
