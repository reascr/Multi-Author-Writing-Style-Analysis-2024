I had to threaten to donate to Hershel to slow them down. I would never, but I don’t know what else to say at this point. 7 calls a day for multiple days is fucking ridiculous, especially after I said “yes I’m voting for him again, now stop calling me.”.
I’m voting for Warnock, but I’m getting so many spam texts and calls that I’m about to lose my mind.
Dont worry homie I'm voting for Warnock myself. I'm having a hard time getting anyone else to vote bc they don't want jurry duty or they don't care. But I'll be there.
Afaik idk I can't force them to vote tho. We do get paid but only like 100 and employers don't pay you. I'm down for more jury duty but I've never been anyways so fuck it. This is my first time voting at all.
Ive heard it from like 5 people each I could potentially wiggle to the Demacrats, they are politically inept small town people who just want cheap gas. I tell em all the time about how they are lied to by the media and that the only way to fix it is to vote dem and then we gotta get all the career politicians and geriatrics.
