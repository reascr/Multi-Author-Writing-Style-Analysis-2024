I'm not ideologically opposed to genetic splicing. Yet with the current implementation and legal framework, patentable GMOs are basically setting up major staple crops for a similar collapse.
Whether the patents are BS or not, the law is the law, and knowingly & massively violating seed restrictions over tens or hundreds of thousands of hectacres of farmland is going to get you in trouble. Just like if a company reproduces a patented drug, they're going to be sued.
There is no farmer who should not have known what they were doing was going to get them in trouble. They knowingly violated the restrictions on those seeds.
But, at least it's not like you can't grow the crops at all without paying for the seeds. Every crop has seeds available without any restrictions at all, many are excellent strains. Even if you can't get a super-disease-resistant strain, you can still take efforts to prevent/treat disease on your crop -- yeah it costs money, but it's at least not as bad as holding life-saving medication behind patents (which I also agree is a problem).
