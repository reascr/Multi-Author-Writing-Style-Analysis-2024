The universe of GOP staffers is a notoriously small one, where even the most diametrically opposed Republican politicians often have overlapping orbits between their staffs. But there are two GOP stars with remarkably little overlap: Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.
DeSantis has nowhere to run except to compete on how more unAmerican he can be than Trump. He really can't compete on fame or swagger and cults tend to be extremely resistant to just jumping to a new Messiah.
If DeSantis doesn't carry Florida next week with a mandate, he is done. He's evaluation isn't Ohio, it's how he can command THE swing state of all swing states. If it's even close, Trump can hammer that home to everyone that matters to DeSantis in a single social media post. Trump can't share the GOP at all. It's most of his active revenue streams and the key to staying free and rich. DeSantis is a far bigger threat to Trump than any Democrat, DA, or court.
Trump has a talent for ending GOP careers and his message goes where no amount of Democrat money of media can enter.
