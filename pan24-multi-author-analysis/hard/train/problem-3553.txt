I'm thinking you are a bit generous that they won't fall in line. Hierarchy is what conservatives believe in stronger than any religion. If powerful conservative figureheads tell them to vote a certain way, they most likely will, as that is a person higher on the hierarchy giving them orders.
Consrrvative media and figures are sort of hedging their bets a bit, imo. They are allowing shit talk of Trump, allowing some people to say he is a personal non grata, and talking up DeSantis, but mostly remaining silent. They are seeing which way the winds blow by election day, while slowly propping up the candidate which can be controlled and they want to win (desantis).
Not saying trump can't win. Not saying he isn't dangerous. But I think Republicans in power are trying their darndest to keep him from winning the primary.
Though it won't matter much GOP will fall victim to the generational political shift that started this midterm no matter the candidate. And they have nearly 0 chance of winning over Gen Z in two years, especially if Trump and DeSantis are the best options.
I am more afraid that trump runs and wins enough electoral votes to deny either party a majority. Sending it to the house which would be a serious cluster fuck.
