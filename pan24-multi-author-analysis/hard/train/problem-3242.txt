the person you're answering to meant nobody but islam fundamentalists get this upset, so they're completely right in the sense that this attack (and probably the 2011 one) was caried out by people butthurt by the 2006 publication of the caricatures.
I think the correct response at this point is full-bore, non-stop mockery of Mohammad, the Quran, the whole stupid Shia/Sunni thing, and the precepts of Islam generally.
And I ask this because in the USA you have lots of not Muslims who froth at the mouth for insulting their religion. They get violent and take over government positions to assert authority. They are currently waging war against women's rights. They might be using different tactics currently, but that will change.
I'm so confused as to how you compare these two things. One being a church, the other being any person who follows a religion.
So like trying to take over countries via politics and attacking women's rights is reasonable? I'm not comparing extremists here, just pointing out that neither religion sits down and takes insults. They're both after the same thing, and it is not global harmony.
Like who is the catholic church you are referring to, and what's the equivalent for Muslims? Because I'm pretty sure Iran isn't like the head of all Muslims.
