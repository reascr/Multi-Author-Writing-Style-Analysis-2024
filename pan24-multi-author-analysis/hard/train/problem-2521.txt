I would argue that there are certain privileges that citizens should have over non-citizens and that voting and property ownership are among the most important of these privileges.
I personally think that restricting voting and property ownership to only citizens is a good thing - but the entire country should do it and it should not be race/culture based but citizen based.
Unpopular opinion but the US as a whole really should do more laws like this, land is a massive problem in the US and given the amount of homeless we have and the costs of owning a home, limiting foreign land ownership is a good idea.
I personally don’t think it needs to be as restrictive as a complete ban on all property ownership but some reasonable restrictions to prevent corporate ownership of American land would be wise. Individuals immigrating and owning a residence should be fine, assuming there is a sort of participation in the path to citizenship / permanent resident / etc. or other worthy proofs of legitimacy.
It’s really hard to say what the initial benchmark should be, but it’s most likely solved through ongoing audits and housing is something that should have more protections as it is objectively becoming harder and harder for people to own a home.
