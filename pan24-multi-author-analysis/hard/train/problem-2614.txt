in Russia, the church has long been a business. there are donation boxes for the church in every store. the clergy drive expensive cars, wear expensive watches. they are like rappers in the united states.
I would not want a bloody revolution. But I know that Russia will soon end. I just donâ€™t want China to have influence after the collapse of Russia. Therefore, we will have to look for partners in Europe or the USA.
Yes, in Russia, many people have a conservative view. But the young ones are less than 30 years old, we are now completely closed in the police regime. even if we clandestinely collect force against Putin, then the system is completely with Putin. These assholes are now trying to impose a relationship with China. And we just need help from Europe.
Also, Poland is part of NATO. Attacking Poland would definitely pull in NATO forces. There is no way Russia wins a direct battle with NATO unless they resort to nuclear weapons. I doubt even China would back them if they unleash nukes though.
