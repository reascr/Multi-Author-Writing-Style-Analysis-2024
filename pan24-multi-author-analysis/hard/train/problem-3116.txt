No. No one wants that. This is like the worst IRL Trolley Problem, but 100k+ people have already died. Putin is unpredictable though. No one knows what to do.
I don’t know what you are looking for then. You suggest the US should not commit to investigating war crimes in Ukraine, so please find another volunteer to replace them.
Not to downplay the atrocities happening in Ukraine, but before you start poking fingers at how other nations treat civilians maybe you should hold yourselves accountable for how you treat yours.
Yes it’s hypocrisy, but the smart thing to do here is to side with WHATEVER power holds war criminals accountable and in this case, I’m all for holding Russia accountable.
China is definitely THE modern day nazi country with what they’re doing to Muslim uighurs- literal concentration camps for over 2 million uighurs, with giant incinerators where they burn fetuses that result from forced abortions.
Bro you forgot the worst of it- THE ONLY use of weapons of mass destruction in an act of terrorism and one of the biggest war crimes in history was committed by the US.
