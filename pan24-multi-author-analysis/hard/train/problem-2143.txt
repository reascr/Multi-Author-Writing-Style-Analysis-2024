How could anyone possibly count that? There isn’t an exit poll when you leave a state that says if you’re going to vote for someone and no one is going to look up peoples ballots to find out if they’d recently moved from New York to Florida for political reasons or because their job forced them to or because they were just retiring.
I think the key is DeSantis _bragging_… unless someone asked him to prove it and he then did I don’t how he could possibly know that in reality. Last time this whole “exodus from liberal state to conservative state” was brought up it was later determined that the flow was absolutely no different from any other year regardless of political orientation.
Seems a good issue to rustle up significantly more people to not vote for him. DeSantis needs SOME independents and democrats to vote for him. This isn’t a great way to do that. People keep saying he’s smart and yet this is a seemingly incredibly dumb political move at the national level. Republicans need to be bland enough to get democrats to sit out the vote to win, going HARDER right is already shown as a losing proposition electorally.
Ah yes, going to get so many Republicans killed just so he can do slightly better in the primary and slightly worse in the general election? Not much of a brain in this one is there.
