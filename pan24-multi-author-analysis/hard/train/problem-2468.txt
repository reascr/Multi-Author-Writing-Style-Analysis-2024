People pick and choose from their religion/ideology and dictators and radical groups are no different.
If there was no Islam or religion, men in power would use "our customs" or "our tradition" as the next excuse.
This reminds me of when the Taliban pick and choose things from Islam as well. Like forcing women to cover up but then not letting them run businesses/work, going to school, stoning people for adultery (except the burden of proof in Islam for such a crime is having 4 men seeing the act occur which is virtually impossible), and so on.
"In the Islamic Republic it is illegal to execute a young woman, regardless of her crime, if she is a virgin [â€¦]".
It seems like they can't kill a person who's destined for heaven and all virgin women are destined for heaven despite their "crimes" so they go through the process outlined above.
Not only are these girls raped before they're executed because of a legal requirement, the reason why they can't die virgins in the first place is so they can't go to heaven. They're raped before they're killed for the explicit purpose of sending them to hell after they die.
