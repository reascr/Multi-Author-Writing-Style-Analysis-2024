Fuck that - if they want to declare a filibuster then those fuckers have to stand up and talk the whole fucking time. I can’t just decide to say “I’m working, pay me” and go take a nap at home so neither can these assholes. I’d they want to keep the stupid filibuster in play then they have to stand there and talk for hours. Otherwise get rid of it. Actually just vote out all the republicans.
This is the standard Republican position though. They refuse to acknowledge the semantics at play, they assume “gender” means “biological sex”, and then they pretend that we don’t know what a woman is.
No matter what definition you give of a woman to try and exclude trans women you will ALSO exclude cis women.
Ask them to do it and watch as you can find cis women fall into each and every description they use to try and other trans women from the group.
And sure, someone might be trotting out , but before you do just remember: The grand total of transwomen in that study is 46. Not 222 - that's just the number of people who asked to transition. 46 transwomen were the only participants they had enough data on to use for the study.
Comparing 46 transwomen against a database of 567k ciswomen's performances is... inevitably going to create numbers that don't align. That's just how numbers work.
