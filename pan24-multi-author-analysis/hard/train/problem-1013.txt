Not really. You just keep using the main line until it lets you wait 4 hours to talk to somebody. Thats what you paid them for. They were willing to wait on the phone.
By "they" you must mean republicans. Until very recently (and really still) the IRS has been woefully under funded. Trump exacerbated that extremely. But when rebulicans make it nearly impossible for the IRS to do their job, everyone wants to blame the stressed, overworked employees who are just trying to keep up.
We can't have an quick and easy way to pay taxes because approximately half the government wants it to be annoying and inefficient to pay taxes.
California tried to change their income tax system once. If all you've got in regular income from your job, then the tax people already know how much you make and how much you owe. So they put together a pilot program where they just mailed you a postcard that said "Here's how much you made and how much you owe. If it's all correct, just send this postcard back, and if something is wrong file your taxes normally.".
Duh. Stupid Republicans have been voting for people who significantly lower taxes (remember the GOP Tax Scam disguised as tax ‘reform’) for the wealthy and corporations for four decades.
Don’t pretend useful idiots in the left haven’t abetted this also - always screaming in support of “income tax” increases - when the really rich don’t have ordinary W2 income. The very rich are quite happy to see the working class attack the professional class (their imagined rich) while their own wealth and income streams remain largely untouched.
Just see the rabid responses on Reddit to a person actually earning 300k (eg a doctor or Silicon Valley engineer). Those people are not the problem - but you wouldn’t think that.
