Specifically this was the Nov. 2022 issue with the cover story being titled "Minority Rule -- How 3% of Texans call the shots for the rest of us" by Michael Hardy. A further description of the article's thesis in the Table of Contents attributes the current seemingly deep red make-up of the state's elected officials to "gerrymandering, voter suppression, low primary-election turnout and an anemic Democratic party". There was a interesting little chart in the article showing just how few Texans -- GOP and Dems -- actually turn up to vote in the primaries. So a 'tiny fraction' of voters are choosing the likes of Abbott, Cruz, et al. And I'd guess that a lot of what this article says might well apply to Florida as well.
Well, if they all wind up in Florida it means that those states will be all the 'bluer' and perhaps the Sunshine State can serve as a kind of 'safety valve' where all the reddist of the elderly wingnuts can be isolated.
I think that too many Dems across the country still want to play by 'gentlemen's rules' and to 'take the high road'. They approach things like 'Kumbayah' Care Bears who, quoting the old Coca-cola ad song, 'want to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony' and 'build bridges' and all. That all might have worked 50, 40, 30 even fifteen years ago but these times call for 'Killer Kodiak Bears' not 'make nice Teddy bears.'.
Yup. I'd definitely be asking myself some questions if I lived in Texas. Thankfully, I do not live in Texas.
The answer is that Texas likes entertainment. They like politicians playing theater at the border, busing migrants to the libs. Ted Cruz has done little in the Senate but acting as an Internet troll. Democrats canâ€™t win with kitchen-table issues.
Democrats have lack of a good electoral offer. The false inclusion agenda and the gun restriction is working only in non-educated latino communities that never chnage the vote intention. Democrats are not offering nothing attractive to the rest.
