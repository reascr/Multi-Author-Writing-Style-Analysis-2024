"Our chicken is finger-lickin good. This June 30th we're having a 3 day sale on all finger-food! So eat with your hands and keep your long knives clean for other uses.".
That's the thing. This is not an AI using an unfitting word. This is an unchecked AI celebrating Nazism and crimes against humanity. And I damn well hope it was unchecked, because if someone approved of that, it would be KFC celebrating just that.
That night was the moment where the Nazis pulled off the last bit of mask they had on. Jews were stripped of their possessions, forced into Ghettos, sometimes even killed and all that pretty much on open display for everyone to see. We don't celebrate that day. We commemorate it, if you will, but the only things I feel about it are shame and disgust.
Reichskristallnacht (which is already an euphemism) has NOTHING good about it. It's closer to celebrating Pearl Harbor or the Confederate uprising, or maybe celebrating Guantanamo.
Yes, that's exactly right. Reichskristallnacht is basically Night of the Reichs Crystal (or, in a more figurative sense, Expensive Glassware).
