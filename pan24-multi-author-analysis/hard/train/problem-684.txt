My take is that either malfunctioning S300 missile(russians were hitting themselves with malfunctioning S300 a few times already), or it was kh-101 which trajectory was messed up after AD failed to hit it directly.
The point of firing two missiles would be to prevent a complete failure to disable a target in the case of a misfire, how would both missiles fail and then also both land at the same place? That makes even less sense than the Russians firing 2 missiles at the wrong target.
It was the US that said the missile did not come from Russian territory. The US has been very aware that the annexed territory is Ukraine, not Russia. The Russians are simply denying any involvement, they did not say the missiles did not come from Russian territory. There is no inconsistency about what is or is not Russian territory here.
Then we have these comments with mind stretch looking for ways in which it could still have been launched by russian.
Reddit mindset is funny considering that all other posts suggesting it's been launched by russia and suggesting the trigger of a war are 20x more voted.
