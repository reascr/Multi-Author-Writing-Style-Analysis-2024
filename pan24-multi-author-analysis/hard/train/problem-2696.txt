Bolsonaro's campaign in 2018 said his opponents called him Hitler or Mussolini. They didn't call him corrupt.
Being seen as non-corrupt is a big selling point in Brazilian politics, with politicians all over the ideological spectrum being caught with their hands in the cookie jar.
Brazil has its fair share of problems but when the opposing political party commits a crime, the one currently in power doesnâ€™t sit around waiting to spring on them.
Brazil is extremely corrupt, but our institutions are quite recent and are well prepared in case a new coup attempt comes up, just like it did. Plus we don't have the absurd case of bipartisanship that is destroying the US from the inside.
Also, we don't have the insane US bipartisan system, where there's always a fear of appearing "partisan" or something.
Our Constitution and our institutions are purpose-built to fight against attempted coups. It was all written just after we came out of a military dictatorship.
All three branches of government now have political will, popular support and evidences to go hard on these insurrectionists and whoever is organising and financing them.
