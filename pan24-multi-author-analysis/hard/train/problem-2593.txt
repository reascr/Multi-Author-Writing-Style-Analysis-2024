Actually, both Russia and China are courting South American. There's a long history of the usa sticking its nose in there, supporting the wrong people, hence a dislike for the US. It's not a small continent like people seem to think. Brazil alone is 80 some percent the size of continental usa. Hence, the largest beef supplier in the world any given year.
Brazil has a massive beef market in Russia and China. The Amazon is burned to create pastures for cattle that provide those countries with cheap beef. Shouldn’t be a huge surprise that Brazil’s not a hard-charger for the west.
Also more: Brazil, as I've said before, doesn't have war culture, we also don't have amo to spare. The last war Brazil had was against Paraguay centuries ago. Brazil's international politics was always of "friendly neighborhood", be in good terms with everyone to help in discussions as a neutral part, call it Swiss of South America if you want.
Since WWII basicaly, we've never really got involved with any conflicts, Brazil historically does things via a diplomatical way, keeping a neutral stance and trying to solve conflicts.
Also, Brazil is known as country that that avoids taking sides in any wars, our biggest ally is Argentina, during the war for the Malvinas we didn't took sides, we only took part on helping in the negotiations, Afghanistan the same, Iraq, also didn't took any clear side. The last time Brazil took sides was in WW2 when Brazil sent soldiers to fight in Italy.
