That’s because not enough people voted for him as their first choice. This entire article is asinine because it purposefully ignores that it’s RANKED choice voting. The entire argument is that he wins if you only look at people’s second picks. But if most people wanted Begrich more than the other two, they would’ve put him first. They did not, so they didn’t, which is why he didn’t win.
Palin voters’ second choice wasn’t used bc more people voted for her as their first choice than voters for Begrich as theirs. Again, if most voters wanted him over the other 2, they would’ve put him first; they didn’t, so they didn’t.
So we gave the non-MAGAs a way to vote for a Democrat as second choice instead of "extremist or nothing". Isn't that a win for voters? And pretty enlightening about how unpopular MAGA really is...
So they waited till they couldn't win with a far right MAGAnaut to switch to a voting system that would block extremists.
Ranked choice is a great way to eliminate extremists. And Republicans would rather have a moderate Democrat than the progressive Anchorage wants.
Expect them to keep switching to ranked choice anywhere their MAGA's are about to lose. To prevent a swing to the other side from exactly the system their extremists benefitted from.
