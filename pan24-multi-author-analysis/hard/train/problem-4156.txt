It's very telling that even with all of their gerrymandering, systematic disenfranchisement, and voter fraud they still struggle to win.
For what is no surprise to us, the party that screams about voter / election fraud is committing it in broad daylight with these horrible, anti-democratic measures.
The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which uses various metrics to grade the fairness of districts, gave Florida an F.
For anyone wondering about the “red wave” that only seemed to happen in Florida… DeSantis cheated HARD by extreme racial gerrymandering, and disenfranchising voters who completed their sentences, but might have owed money to the state. Also, mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day, but received after 7pm, were NOT COUNTED and tossed out.
I requested a mail in ballot almost 3 weeks before election, received it the Friday before election. I called the supervisor of elections and asked if they would even get it by Tuesday 7pm. They said “it’s possible”. Ended up paying $30 to overnight it but I have talked to multiple people that didn’t get their ballot in time.
