Ukraine has a lot more obligations to fill than just that, and with their latest changes to the Ukraine Supreme Court, they haven't even bothered to move in the right direction for that!
No, as is and as much as we want Ukraine to kick the Russians the fuck out, a EU membership really isn't and was never in the picture, war or no war...
It's just not going to happen unless and until Ukraine is able to fulfill the EU criteria for joining, which clearly they aren't all that interested in these days given the latest changes.
The EU should be ready to jump on helping Ukraine to join as soon as the war is over, mixing together the accession process with reconstruction aid, to rebuild a post war Ukraine as a European country. But rushing it now will only make it illegitimate and incomplete.
But it's also impractical for Ukraine to join while partially occupied. How will they hold a referendum on it, for example? How do you begin the work on things like infrastructure standardization and measuring humanitarian and social program standards when none can even be delivered?
