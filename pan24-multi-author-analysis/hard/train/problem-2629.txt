I’m not American, but don’t states have executive branches and that’s basically the governors office? And they also have the same executive, legislative and judicial powers as the federal government? Wouldn’t “Governor executive privilege,” just mean he would have the ability to seek honest advice and shield it from the legislative and judicial branches of the state government?
Just to play Devil's Advocate a moment, as mentioned in the article some states do apparently recognize executive privilege for their governors. I'm highly skeptical Florida should be one of them but governors do sometimes have similar executive privilege to the President depending on their state constitution and how the courts have ruled.
While true that governors are executives of their states, executive privilege was created when federal courts ruled that such a privilege was implied for presidents by the federal constitution.
That’s not even the same constitution that creates governors or that separates governors’ powers from those of the state legislatures and state judiciaries. States have their own constitutions for that.
Executive privilege wasn’t even litigated for presidents until 1974, so we’re only talking about the last 49 years.
