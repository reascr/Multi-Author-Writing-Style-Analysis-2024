When consulting with a contractor, it turns out they couldn't get a permit. The reason is the gas line was 1" to the meter, but only half inch out to the house. In order to supply enough gas for the worst-case scenario of all appliances in use at the same time, they needed a 3/4" line from the meter. This would have required basically re-plumbing the entire house for gas, tearing out all the exterior walls and ceilings in the lower level to get to all the appliances located in the middle of the house.
Just wanted to point out that due to permits and county inspections (if you ever want to be able to sell the house), it is not always as easy as add a gas line and you're good. Being able to maintain proper gas pressure is a consideration, and if the house was designed a certain way, a retrofit might be a bit more involved.
A more realistic regulation would be to require that gas stoves be installed under a hood that vents to the outside of the house. Too many vents only filter and recirculate the air.
And even with the vent fan on… not all the fumes would be caught by it. There’s still some fumes dissipating into the home.
You’d have to have it on all the time, though, as the problem is that gas stoves leak gas even when not in use.
30 years ago that was a recommendation concerning gas stoves provided by our gas supplier. Provide adequate venting to the outside and use it every time you use the stove.
