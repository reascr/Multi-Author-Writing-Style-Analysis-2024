I work for a Japanese company in the US and we have members from japan that stay at the US branch for 2-5 years. I am always dumbfounded that even here in the US, the Japanese employees will stay til 7-8 every night, sometimes all the way til 10:00. And it’s not like they are doing anything. I’ve stopped by the office late at night to pick something up and they will just be sitting at their desks browsing the internet or goofing off on their phones but they absolutely will not go home. It’s definitely not the American managers making them stay. They just are so used to the culture that none of them will go home and they all “work” 12 hours a day or more.
My girlfriend is Japanese and she absolutely refuses to move back to Japan. She can’t go back to certain aspects of the culture.
The thing is, they answer to a Japanese manager that is there in the US temporarily the same as them. So even though the American managers don’t care one way or the other, the Japanese manager maintains the Japanese work culture for the Japanese employees. I feel bad for them, but they all seem so used to it.
I'm sorry to hear your experience. We tend to look at Japanese Medical Literature with a healthy scepticism due to publication bias (although not a generalisation to all research).
