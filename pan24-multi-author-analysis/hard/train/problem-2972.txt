The msm won’t mention that the UN signed two Minsk agreements to guarantee Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as autonomous zones. Instead of upholding this agreement, Ukraine (at the consent of NATO and the US) violated this agreement and have slaughtered 14k Russian Ukrainians since 2014, precipitating the current conflict.
Good on them. The US is using Ukraine as blood pawns to wash US taxpayers money into the hands of the military industrial complex.
The is the situation in the current day GOP, one half is bought by US defense industry, the others by Russian oligarchs (who are also the Russian 'defense' industry).
Now the Ukrainian army is collapsing and hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have lost their lives fighting an army 3x their size… all so the US could extract tax payer money and give it to western oligarchs.
It’s time to end the war and let Ukraine strike a peace agreement before the whole country gets steamrolled or we get goose stepped into world war three.
“We must suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately,”.
