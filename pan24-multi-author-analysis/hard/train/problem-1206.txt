Trump won the 2016 election. No one is doubting or disputing that. Trump was "illegitimate" insofar as though he did not collude with Russia, it is a demonstrable fact that his numbers were bolstered due in large part to foreign interference. I think it's fair to say that when it came down to it, Russia had a preference between Clinton and Trump, and did everything they could on the social media propaganda front to make that happen. Trump was also illegitimate in the same way that a candidate like Herschel Walker in Georgia is illegitimate â€” in that they have absolutely no business even getting near government office. They're both idiots who couldn't govern their way out of a paper bag.
Members of his campaign did...but I don't think Trump ever like, verbally expressed to Putin that he wanted him to interfere in the election. Where Trump truly fell on his face was at the summit in Helsinki in 2018 when Trump sided with Putin over our own vast U.S. intelligence agencies when Putin swore up and down that there was absolutely no attempt at interference. That was the day that Trump put on full display for all the world to see that while he may not have been a Russian agent, he was most certainly a Russian asset.
So to try and imply that Hakeem Jeffries is some kind of extremist election denier (like Trump, like Marjorie Greene, like Kari Lake, and others have proven themselves to be) is simply not accurate.
It's not a fair comparison for a few reasons: Jeffries wasn't denying Trump won the electoral college; and "election denier" is a term that has taken on a very specific meaning post 2020, and that meaning is at odds with Jeffries' comments.
Jeffries was referring to Russian interference in the 2016 election, and I think it's fair to argue that a president elected with the aid of a foreign government (and US adversary) is _less_ legitimate than a president elected without said massive influence campaign, especially when the former loses the popular vote.
