Right? I just wonder how much damage they are doing to their own organizations by pulling these stunts. I think most of us agree that doing our part to to save the environment/climate is a good thing. However, when groups do things like this - why would you even want to hear what they have to say?
I just feel they are trying to bring attention to climate, but are making people talk more about the negativity of their actions than the actual message they are trying to spread.
Activists are either trying to game the system to get their message out there, annoying people in the process, or being misrepresented by someone who wants to slander their image/undermine their message. It's probably a little of both, given how widespread it has become.
The more of these that come out the less I actually believe it. I never underestimate how stupid people can be but the unusually high levels of bullshit recently appears more like a smear campaign on activism, probably funded by the oil and auto industry's.
Given the tactics oil companies have used to downplay climate change and keep people in the dark over the years, it wouldn't surprise me if these were false flag attacks designed to stir up exactly the anti-activist sentiment you're showing.
Honestly, I question wether this is just rampant stupidity on the part of the activists or if some are false flag ops by oil conglomerates. There is nothing about blocking traffic or hassling paintings that will help the cause. It wouldn't work even if the problem was ignorance. Which for the most part it isn't imo. More like inertia, combined with the wealthiest choosing to continue doing what made them rich. It's great for pising people off though. And alienating them from your cause.
