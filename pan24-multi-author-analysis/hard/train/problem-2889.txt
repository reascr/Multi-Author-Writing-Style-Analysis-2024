No defense will be 100% and the Patriot system, while highly capable, is no different nor is it a silver bullet for every threat. There are less expensive solutions to deal with cheap and small drones and hypersonic missiles are a whole another matter entirely.
Despite Patriot's high price, it is far cheaper than having to replace critical infrastructure that would have otherwise been destroyed and of course, there is no doubt, it will save lives which are priceless.
Of course, the Patriot doesn't have the range to hit Russian strategic bombers launching cruise missiles (or any other missiles) from Russian airspace potentially many hundreds of miles away.
Nothing anyone in the world has can intercept hypersonic missiles, even the bootleg air-launched iskanders Russia likes to parade around as if theyâ€™re a huge threat to anything.
Sure, and that's not nothing, but Russia doesn't have a ton of ballistic missiles left. The current threat is mostly air-launched cruise missiles and shahid-type drones, both of which NASAMS is more than capable of dealing with.
More the reverse, Patriot was designed to target aircraft and had at the time been able to engage ballistic missiles in theory. It was after the first Gulf War and with subsequent upgrades that Patriots' primary role went to ballistic missile defense.
Patriot gets you protection against enemy fighters and bombers, and enemy ballistic missiles. The first two don't operate in Ukrainian airspace, and the latter exists in short supply in Russian stockpiles.
