I don’t doubt there’s people with these views, but their honestly stupid if they think Russia is simply being “soft” here. So even if someone who believed this were to come into power, assuming a world that’s possible, they are going to find out real quick this is the best Russia has to offer militarily.
I suppose someone can always find a way to worry about extremists and nuclear weapons, but that’s the ONLY other card someone new could actually play, and not just talking about it, but doing it. But that’s obviously a lose to lose to Russia, there’s no winning there, period end of story.
- So, in the end the Russia's complete victory will be the only choice for Russian authorities, but it would have much lesser cost if they acted correctly from the start.
I am not an expert to discuss how effective certain measures are - but, obviously, if desired, Russia can come up with a lot of other things to do in Ukraine.
P.S. Btw, if for some reasons the current Russian government loses the power before the end of the confilct or if the results of the conflict are viewed bad in Russia, it's quite a descent chance that the next one will share views of this kind at least partially.
