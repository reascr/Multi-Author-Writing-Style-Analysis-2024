Due to their demographics, this is the last chance Russia has to maintain and/or expand their position of power. They won't have the manpower to do this shit in just a decade from now.
Their borders are so long, that they are impossible to defend, especially with their lack of infrastructure, but they also lack men to sufficiently protect. Most countries have natural borders helping them, such as mountains, big bodies of water etc. But that's not the case for Russia. What Russia fears more than anything, is NATO, and rightly so. If NATO went in, Russias only option quickly becomes nukes. NATO members see NATO as a deterrent/defensive alliance, but it's viewed the opposite in Russia.
NATO countries arenâ€™t really actively doing anything, and the collective west is not in or near Ukraine.
Not really agreeing with your statement that NATO isn't actively doing anything and we are not near Ukraine. We are, and were doing a lot. AWACS aircraft fly near the border 24/7 and without our munitions and hardware being sent Ukraine wouldn't have lasted, i love that were helping but saying that were aren't actively involved just isn't true.
