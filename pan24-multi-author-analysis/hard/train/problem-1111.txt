My school loans are paid off but I’m all about student loan forgiveness. It’s not right to send young people into adulthood in crippling debt simply for getting educated.
Forgiveness isn’t even the right word it’s passing the buck onto responsible Americans who choose to not go to college or paid their debt.
If so, you should understand why someone who has already paid off their loans would like to be included in this forgiveness (issued a tax credit at least).
Yes, it would be better for the 1% to pay their fair share, but it's not necessary for student loan forgiveness to pay dividends in the economy.
You know the two programs are pretty close on price, granted the edge going to student loan forgiveness over a ten year span. Though farm subsidies doubled under Trump after his stupid trade war.
No one will take you seriously if you don't realize incentivising college educations will pay dividends toward the future of this country. We've shifted primarily to a service based economy and if we ever want to get our manufacturing sector to grow again we need educated people to design and create new technologies that can be made here.
They were included, they were just too dumb to realize. What are all of those college kids going to do with that new disposable income now, put it in a mattress? Fuck no, they're going to buy things they need and want. That money goes back into the economy where people who make, and provide those goods and services are taxed on everything they do and buy then the money goes back into the government.
