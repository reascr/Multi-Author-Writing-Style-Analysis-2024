I think people forget that there are more than a few abrahamic religions that aren’t the three they’ve heard of. Samaritans also still exist, albeit not very many.
The concept of what an arab is or isn’t always confused me. Persians aren’t Arabs, okay makes sense, distinct language and culture. Christian Arabs are, or at least seem to be considered Arabs so it’s not abt having to be Muslim. But Yemeni Jews aren’t Arabs?? And Druze also aren’t, but the last two groups speak Arabic?
In ancient times maybe but the modern definition of Arab is any group who use Arabic as their main language. Which explains why you have Arabs in Sudan, in Morocco, in Libya, in Egypt. Not all those peoples descend from Arabian (ethnic) tribes.
Absolutely untrue. They are Arab speaking (as their main language) which by definition makes them Arabs. They do not identify as Muslims, which is maybe what you intended to say?
Not much to explain, they’re another small ethnoreligious group from the middle east. A lot of them live in Israel (they’ve often been persecuted in arab states) but I think plenty also still live in nearby lebanon/syria/jordan.
