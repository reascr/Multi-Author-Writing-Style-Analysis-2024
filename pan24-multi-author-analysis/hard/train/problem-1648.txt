Common core based education has proven to give students the necessary skills needed to be a productive part of society. There are activists of color that cannot articulate their cause do to lack of proper English.
Crt is a theory, hence the t in the name. DeSantis has no problem with it not being taught. Crt is one-sided in favor of the black people, there where social ecomical during that part of history that aren't present today. To call for reparations is just ridiculous. If reparations are due it should come from the African tribe leaders that sold their own people to the slave trader's.
"African people were taken from their homelands, forced into slavery in brutal conditions. Eventually they were 'freed' but still treated like shit. Eventually they weren't treated quite as bad, but still not great. And now they have the right to exist.".
"Additionally they have contributed greatly to our society. Serving in our military, contributing to science and the arts. And building this nation into a global superpower all while being treated as less than human.".
LMAO. Why are you so afraid of US history? Do you understand many people in NJ aren't degenerate scumbag Republican cowards? Not everyone sees what's happening in Republican shitholes like Florida and says, "Yes, I want to be a disgusting, delusional bottom-feeder as well!".
Yes. Republicans are scared of history snd science and are very, very mad their insane delusions aren’t catered to by people who live in reality and/or aren’t absolutely disgusting moral degenerate filth.
