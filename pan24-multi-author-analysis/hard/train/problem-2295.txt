Also read the fucking article, they evem talk about a dozen projects that got the green light despite those new rules.
And if they greenlit projects... then they have lied about the requirement I pointed out. I'm sure their paper SAYS it will not encourage more drivers, but taking 50 drivers off the road to run one bus instead (never gonna happen) just made space for 40+ more drivers and the roads nicer to drive for all drivers.
Even if every road in the country is jam-packed solid 24/7 (or, equally, completely empty), you wouldn't be able to build a road and claim that it wouldn't increase the number of cars on the road.
I think it's a fair point to argue that a lack of roads suppresses and keeps from recognition of a need (travel), and that, with roads, that need is now able to be met, which might result in more cars. But now you've acknowledged that you're directly suppressing the people's needs, which does not seem to be a proper function of government.
No one is going to buy a car and drive it on the roads so that those bigger roads don't feel lonely.
