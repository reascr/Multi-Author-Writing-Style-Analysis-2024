It's a bipartisan thing. Just look how in the past how donors influenced Democrats to go to war. Or more recent how Sam of FTX became the second biggest donor of the Democrats just to influence politician's.
The entire system is broken. Money buys influence, and therefore the wealthy individuals in societies will prevail.
The wealth gap and the power of dark money in politics means that the super rich can buy the politicians and outcomes they want.
The Railroad Barons were corrupt as hell and bribery was pretty much EXPECTED in politics in the Gilded Age.
We saw this in the last two years of the Trump administration. The Democratic-controlled Senate sent bills to the Republican-controlled House. The Republican Senate Leader, Mitch McConnell, would not even schedule those House bills for official debate or deliberation. He would sit on them until they expired, effectively.
The process is often multi-directional, however. The House may pass a bill and send it to the Senate. Then the Senate may make changes or alterations. At that point it goes back to the House to reconcile the differences before going to the President. The Senate can draft bills but they still have to get passed by the House before they can be given an up or down vote in the Senate.
House and Senate are both needed to even get bills to have the potential to become law. The House can originate bills more easily (that's its job), but that doesn't mean the Senate has to officially vote on what the House sends them.
The idea is that the House originates bills, they go up to the Senate, and then they go to the President.
