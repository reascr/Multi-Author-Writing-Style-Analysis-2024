>Serbia will ask NATO peacemakers to let it deploy Serbian military and police in Kosovo, although it believes there is no chance of the request being approved, President Aleksandar Vucic said on Saturday.
Thereâ€™s a part of the resolution that lets NATO allow a few Serbian troops to help defend Orthodox sites and some Serbian majority areas.
But that was before NATO helped Kosovo declare independence and got everyone worth asking to acknowledge it.
And while all of NATO is in the UN and complies with 1244, Kosovo is not, and therefore it is up to Kosovo to decide what happens on their territory.
By agreement and UN Resolution 1244, serbs have right to deploy no more than1000 soldiers or policeman In Kosovo . US and EU do recognize that. However serbs never use that. Until now, but what is the reason?
Because , no matter of deckared independence of Kosovo and recignition , Kosovo is not recognized bu UN and its not a member of. Resolution that give serbs right to send no more than 1000 servicemen is UN resolution. So the right to return is undesputable.
