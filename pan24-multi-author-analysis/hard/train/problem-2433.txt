I'm a liberal voter, as well as a legal gun owner. Guns are not my entire identity but I'm honestly getting pissed off. There are so many more important issues they can be tackling, but they choose this. It feels like its personal. World's burning down around us, grocery chains price gouging hard, and they choose this. Mendocino gets on TV, makes misleading statements but people who aren't gun owners will not care.
A lot of comments that can be replied to but I'll reply to this one. I'm not ABC (CBC?) but immigrated when I was a kid. Never thought I'd own firearms until I tried it at another Chinese person's cottage and was hooked. The focus and breathing and nice weather outside was incredibly relaxing. That's what I still like now, been shooting smallbore prone. Nothing is quite as relaxing as focusing on just 1 thing for a couple of hours and thinking about nothing else.
Theres also a perception that it's only enjoyed by a certain demographic, which is not true here in Canada! For example I'm seeing more and more chinese people get into it, join ranges, being directors. At least 2 of the largest gun stores in the GTA are Chinese owned.
Looking at some of the replies to our comments, its unfortunate that our politics is becoming increasingly tribal and polarized on both sides.
I feel like we are prone to coalescing political support on compelling issues that are divisive and failing to make a difference on very important things which would benefit citizens on all sides of the electoral aisle.
So this is all a big setup because a lot of people have elections coming up and resisting the government is always more popular than being a filthy collabrator.
