Jacobin seems to have forgotten that FDR had a Democratic supermajority in both chambers. Almost 3/4ths of the entire Congress was Dem.
No, we just need swing voters to elect a few more normie Dems. If the Dems held the house and won in Wisconsin for Senate, they'd suddenly be able to just bypass Manchin and Sinema. Then the new Manchin would be Jon Tester, someone who would still gleefully torpedo the progressive platform if it was pushed onto him, but who would nonetheless allow for a lot more normie liberal policy to pass vs Manchin and Sinema (Tester was open to bypassing the filibuster for voting rights and abortion rights as well as for a BBB that was at least $3t, for example). That's how you get progress, not by expecting someone to magically force senators to do stuff they don't want to do, but instead by just getting somewhat better folks elected who will allow for more change.
Because the voters once again refused to empower Biden and his breed of mainstream Dems with the sort of majorities they'd need to actually get their ambitious agenda done.
Biden is basically where the average Democrat voter is politically, so stop calling a majority of Dem voters “corporate” or you’ll continue to lose primary races.
