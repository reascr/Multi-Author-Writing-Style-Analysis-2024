Except for when Cubans get a debit card and housing from the US government as soon as they set foot in this country. Socialism for me and not for thee.
They only understand socialism in their own terms. This is their problem. The Republican party will exploit this fact and they will continue to support the Republican party of so-called conservatives.
Florida is a battleground, but republicans spend more than five times the money than the democrats, who have spent elsewhere, more effectively perhaps.
Furthermore, this was a mid-term election with a bad democratic candidate for governor (a former republican), and a hurricane in the heaviest democratic counties.
Florida is certainly pretty red now unfortunately, but the Democrats also have massive organization issues in the state and a candidate issue in the governor race specifically. Charlie Crist is a Republican turned independent turned Democrat who is constantly seeking power and no one actually likes him. The second they put him on the ballot they probably lost by an additional 10 points.
Crist is a terrible candidate who has lost every statewide race he ran in as a Democrat. He is a former Republican governor the party no longer wants and for some reason the Democrats think anyone else wants him (they don't).
