However, the insane amount of loss of mat√©riel in Ukraine means that this war has been far more painful for Russia than Afghanistan ever was to the Soviet Union.
When you consider that the Soviet military was vastly bigger in terms of raw numbers than the Russian military was at the start of 2022, then the losses Russia has sustained are even more painful.
No wonder Russia will lose the wars they started cause they are no longer fighting lousy terrorists in their country, but a professional army full of foreign PMC.
They are going to be very weak after they lose to Ukraine and risk a vulnerable few decades where they can only defend their interests with nukes and nothing else.
No, Putin's options have always been either a) win the war and take over Ukraine, or b) lose Crimea back to the Ukrainians and lose all credibility inside Russia. Putin is ride-or-die and has been since February.
Had he pulled out at that point, Ukraine would've (and still will) gone after Crimea. To him, a Russian Crimea is non-negotiable. Crimea is the largest objective for Russia. The land bridge from the Donbass is largely another way to ensure Crimea can be supplied from the mainland. Kherson was about securing Crimea's supply of fresh water.
