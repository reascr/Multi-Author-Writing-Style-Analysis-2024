White slave owners in the south got rich from slave labor. Whether that money passed down to any heirs post civil war today idk. Maybe. At the same time the South never really recovered economically from the civil war and has high rates of poverty, so maybe the money was lost. Maybe the wealth gap is more about post 1920s discrimination in funding for schools, job opportunities, segregation, redlining, etc.
Personally none of my ancestors owned slaves, some people particularly in the south got rich of slave labor, and if the generations alive today still benefit from it then they would be theoretically the ones most direct responsible in today's age. Having tax payors pay for it, rather than the people who actually got the money owning slaves, seems unjust to me.
A state that never allowed slaves using taxpayer dollars from people who never owned slaves and giving to people that never were slaves.
The African counties should pay reparations not only to the descendants of the slaves but also the white people that fought for their freedom. The slave trade was run why black kings who would capture their enemies and sell them to white people. Africa has a lot to apologize for to its people (not to mention the shameful history of Liberia, where freed black slaves who returned from America started â€¦ capturing and selling slaves as their main income. People are so rotten).
