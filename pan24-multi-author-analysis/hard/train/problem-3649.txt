Sadly, It was already incorrect when posted. As of Feb 14, we were at 71. (According to the gun violence archive.) There have been at least three more since then. (GVA defines mass shooting as having a minimum of four victims shot, either injured or killed, not including any shooter who may also have been killed or injured in the incident.).
This. She truly beleived that Trump wasn’t ever going to win and she would step down under Hilary. It was a gamble that didn’t pay off and remember, if she had died 11 days later, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation but as you say, McConnel is scum and forced through the fastest nomination in history.
Meh, I get the point but you’re wrong when it came to RBG - she was sharp as a whistle and one of our greatest minds until the very end. I just think we need regular cognitive tests for anyone over 70, like we do for driver licenses.
California - drivers over 70 must renew in person (not online like everyone can), pass a vision and written test which effectively acts as a cognitive test.
She truly believed that Trump would never set foot in the Oval Office and that she’d step down under Hilary. It was a gamble that didn’t pay off.
She made a gamble and it didn’t work out. She truly thought Hilary would but also don’t delude yourself in thinking that McConnel wouldn’t have rammed through ACB even with a new president or pulled the same shit he did with Garland.
