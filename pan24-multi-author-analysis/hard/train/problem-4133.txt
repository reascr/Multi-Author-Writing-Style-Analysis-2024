I was unknowingly purged from my state's voter roll and had to re-register. The registration cutoff is 30 days before election day and there is no same-day registration here. Had I not realized it happened though, my vote would have been blocked.
I do not understand why I was purged though - I voted in November 2020 for sure, and I did not move between then and now.
I've been voting since the mid-90s and I never felt democracy was on the line until 2020. I don:t know how anyone else felt, but that was my personal feeling.
For everyone who didn't AT LEAST vote: your excuses, justifications, "concerns" and equivocations won't mean a thing when the Republicans take power.
And it’s astounding the amount of voters that give up just because their primary candidate didn’t get chosen.
Just because your favorite progressive candidate doesn’t get the nod from the DNC doesn’t mean the rest of the country has to suffer.
Don't forget the Democrats being entirely unwilling to put forward a candidate that gets voters interested. If they bothered to give someone besides old establishment types a chance, they might have more draw from the voters.
