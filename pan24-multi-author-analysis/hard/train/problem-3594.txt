We found a diplomatic solution. Trump killed it. Finding another looks like a remote possibly as we have lost credibility. At this point Iran will align with Russia and China and may develop a nuke. The US public will not support another war. So soon we may say hello to the next nuclear power, as we did with North Korea.
For example, the US should encourage China to station nukes in North Korea in exchange for no NK nuclear program. Same with South Korea. They get to have US nukes but controlled by QUAD.
The only way to disarm a specific country is to have nukes be controlled by multinational military alliances like NATO. Let Iran have nukes in their country but their control is maintained by a separate military command structure made up of them and their allies. That would mean that any use of nuclear weapons offensively would condemn all countries in the alliance and therefore would put pressure on the countries to not use nukes or to escalate conflicts they shouldnâ€™t be involved in.
I know that NK has done nuclear tests, but nobody knows if they have functioning nuclear weapons, hence I don't think it's wrong to call them an aspiring nuclear power.
Regarding Iran's nuclear program, it's widely acknowledged that there is a great deal of concern about the potential for the country to acquire nuclear weapons. Many factors are at play.
