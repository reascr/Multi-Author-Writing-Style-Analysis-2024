You're not wrong - fascists and bigots, much like lonely little trolls, consistently prove that if there's one thing that motivates them even more, it's the disdain of reasonable people. Shame never works on them, it just galvanizes them even more in the thinking that their artificial tribe is persecuted and in need of defense.
However, as seen in Iran and Ukraine, there is something to be said about shining an international spotlight on human rights issues - it gives legitimacy and validity to any dissenters, and helps them gain support more quickly, including within their own country. Of course, and unfortunately, the reality is that Qatar doesn't seem to have much in the way of internal dissent.
Sure, but that doesn't mean people shoudn't avoid supporting Qatar. Whataboutism doesn't help your argument. People can care about the abuses by Qatar and by other places too. I do agree with you that people are likely to completely forget about it once the world cup is over, but if anything that just means making an impact now is even more important.
Nor do I, but if you have next to no one watching the world cup matches, then it impacts their bottom line, which is the only thing that might change their mind.
Well the idea is that by drawing attention to it and boycotting the event then it won't just forgotten about, and that FIFA won't be willing to take these bribes cause of the impact it has on them. I'm not saying whether that'll be effective or not, but that's the idea.
