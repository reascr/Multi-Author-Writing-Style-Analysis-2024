Meanwhile, for all their outrage on the internet, young Americans are still voting less than any other age group (yet still have the gall to complain about the results).
More Americans voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016. They saw four years of daily scandals and said, "Yes, more of that!".
"But.... But what about Hunter Biden's laptop? How do we know if his dick pics haven't been photoshopped to look bigger??? The American people deserve to know".
Trump: "BIDEN 👐 is the most CORRUPT president 👌 in the history of the world. I would know, I am 👐 a very corrupt president, but not as corrupt as Sleepy Joe Biden. I am 👌 the corruption America needs to defeat the radical left Democrats".
If youth voter turnout was consistently at a rock-solid 70%, the Republican Party would lose every single election in the future. With 90% youth turnout, the Dems could get 70/100 Dems in the Senate and 340+ House Dems, so a literal FDR-era Democrat supermajority. It would essentially be permanent if the GOP doesn't massively reform (which is unlikely to happen).
