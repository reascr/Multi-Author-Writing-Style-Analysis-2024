Secondly Ukraine has already proven they can take back territory even with what they have now, and that will only improve while what Russia has will only get worse through attrition.
6% is a fucking massive chunk of Ukraine's territory... Drop it in Pervomaisk, and the entirety of Ukrainian held SW Ukraine is safe, because to get beyond it, you'd have to go through it. Don't need to protect Uman from drone attacks out of Crimea, if the drones can't get there in the first place... Drop the second gifted battery in Dnipro, and all of eastern Ukraine is now covered. You don't need to protect every square inch of Ukraine to provide credible air defense cover to every square inch... unless you think Russia has a teleporter that can send drones right into the middle of Ukraine where there's no air defense systems that is...
And yes, their personnel need to be trained, particularly the fire control and launcher teams, so that they know what they're looking at on radar and fire at what they're supposed to, so that they don't look like dumbasses akin to how the fire control team aboard the Moskva looks.
PAC-2 missile has a public range of 100 miles. MPQ-65 radar has a public 125 mile range, but is more likely to be 150-200 mile radar range given the amount of transceiver modules in it.
Launchers are all going to be in the same general area due to the radar location. Given the area of a circle is Ï€R2, and we know the radius is 100 miles, you're looking at an envelope of around 31,000 miles. Radar can't see behind it or to the extreme sides of it, so lets say 45% of that. That's still 14,000 square miles, or around 6% of Ukraine's 233,000 square mile territory.
