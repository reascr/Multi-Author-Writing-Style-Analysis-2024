The casuals need something to parrot. Now that it has become evident the Russian economy will not collapse in a matter of months like those morons were parroting at the beginning of the war, they've resorted to taking some rando's opinion collage as fact.
During the first few months there were so many headlines “Russian economy will collapse any moment now!” At least there’s more variation and realism these days, not only “sanctions totally work” propaganda.
The Russian Central Bank has done well to combat the impact of sanctions but they can't hold out forever, and its running out of tricks to keep sanctions at bay.
Sanctions aren't working, means send more military and put pressure on other countries trading with Russia.
The west realizes this is going to be long war and is letting Russia bleed itself. The west is invested in keeping Ukraine out of Russian control and will continue with its military support for the foreseeable future.
Russian had large troop build ups and ammo caches that the Ukrainians couldn't strike within Ukrainian territory, giving Russians the advantage. So the west gave the Ukrainians HIMARS, long range artillery, and they destroyed Russians reserves and ammo depots.
Some examples, Russian tanks were an aggressive and difficult struggle to defend against, so west gave javelins and anti tank weapons that destroyed the Russian tanks.
My understanding of this war is that the West will supply whatever military equipment the Ukrainians need to defend themselves against the Russians. But not provide anything offensive towards Russia.
