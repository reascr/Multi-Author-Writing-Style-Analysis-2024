Yes. And it was a gaggle of Trump-appointed judges who tossed his election protests. The game plan is simple: Call everything that does not go your way rigged or a scandal.
These are the people who did endless Benghazi hearings that produced nothing … because there was nothing aside from a shitty, shitty situation they wanted to use to score political points. When they say the January 6th Committee was a politically-motivated witch hunt, they’re essentially dishonestly calling it what Benghazi committees actually were. This will be more Benghazi.
None of this will matter, and just look at how little weight "Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi" carries these days. Their own investigations found GOP led budget cuts responsible.
What the Clintons represented was the potential for what actually happened. A major DNC win at the federal level and a newly viable party.
There's already evidence this shit and Trump in general is discouraging other voters. 2 years of fruitless investigations into something even a lot of the right already seem to view as laughable is just barreling into what just fucked them in an actual election.
It is disheartening that such a large portion of America is that stupid where treasonous republicans win at any level.
What's really fucking stupid is that Republican leadership knows that Hunter Biden's massive hog is only a cock of interest to Republicans. The rest of America doesn't give a shit about Hunter's big swinging D and just wants Congress to get shit done. So even though nonsense investigations over Hunter's huge wang are likely to hurt Republicans in swing districts and make the GOP less competitive in the 2024 presidential election, they're still 100% committed to using a congressional committee to sweat hard over Hunter's kong dong because if they don't, they'll be ousted in their next primaries by challengers in their districts who will.
