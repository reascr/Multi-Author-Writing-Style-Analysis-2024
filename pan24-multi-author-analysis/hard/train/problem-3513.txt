This just shows that you really don't understand. The government can't do anything of what you are saying, it would be a huge scandal and break many laws. The freedom of expression is the core of Sweden as a country, it's one of the four fundamental laws. There is immense thought behind the laws stopping governments ability to restrict our freedom of expression. It's to the point that they have to protect people with police during protests they deem risky.
Not to mention if a dictator takes one guys protest as an action of the government of Sweden then that is on that dictator lol and not something Sweden can account for.
You think Swedish politicians should break the law just to please an authoritarian leader from a soon-to-be-a-dictatorship country? Then they are no better than Erdo.
So he can keep this charad going for as long as he likes, be my guest, have at it, do your worst. It's all a play for him, to rally support at home and blackmail countries. It might work domestically, sure - but not internationally. There he will just burn his and Turkey's reputation, what little is left still.
Turkey is a loser nation. The only reason the West puts up with them in NATO is because they are very very strategically located.
