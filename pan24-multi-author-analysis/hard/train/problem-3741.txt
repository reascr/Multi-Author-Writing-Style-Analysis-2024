So, some of this goes back to Mueller and trump with Russia. The right learned to hammer on points that are right, but ignore some factual point.
Trump saying no collusion. There is no crime of collusion, so that was always going to be true. Never mind one of his guys gave polling data to a Russian asset.
Mueller, spells out the crimes trump committed, but no one has the political will to do anything about it. So "Mueller exonerated trump" sticks.
It allows them to lie and keep the people believing their bs while being in a completely different world.
They’re just telling themselves lie after lie after lie as part of the alternate universe they live in, as usual.
They considered that to be their “slam dunk.” It’s hard to overstate how ridiculously stupid that is. They literally believe that a Republican My Pillow guy-endorsed Republican saying he “knows” the election outcome would have been different had the ballots been printed properly constitutes clear and convincing evidence that Lake actually won the election. And that that testimony alone should be sufficient cause for a judge to hand the election to Lake, no further questions necessary.
Interesting how the judge carefully considered the testimony of her witnesses and found that EVEN THEY admitted they could find no evidence of malfeasance by election workers.
I remember one of the right wing rags the other day quoting a part of the testimony where the Maricopa attorney asks Lake’s so-called “expert” witness if he has personal knowledge of intentional actions taken by the county that would have affected the election results. In response, the witness says something to the effect of “I know for a FACT that had those ballots been printed correctly that Lake would have won.”.
