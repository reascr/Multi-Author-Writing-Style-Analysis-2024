You already speak a Germanic language, English, so you should be fine learning Dutch for instance. Some of their swearwords are a little iffy though, like "typhus lul" (typhoid penis), yes, lul is Dutch for penis. Have fun learning some languages! D.
You have heard of Google Translate? D It has a pretty nifty interface to translate websites in languages you may not speak P.
I think this link will work - google translate has an option to translate entire webpages. Just bear in mind the usual wonkiness that comes with those translations and that some parts will sound strange.
Sometimes it misidentifies the language, though. The auto-detect feature thought that article was in Finnish at first so it didn't work, but you can change it manually.
Yeah I think I botched the original link I provided, tried replacing it with the link from another commenter who pointed that out. Not quite sure what's up with it, sorry about that.
Oh whoops, yeah in my other comment I noted that issue. I guess I copied the link before I switched it to Norwegian. Thanks for posting it again to save people the headache lol. gonna edit that post now with the link you provided.
ahh yes, the majestic møøse that once bit my sister (that's supposed to be swedish but close enough I suppose lol).
