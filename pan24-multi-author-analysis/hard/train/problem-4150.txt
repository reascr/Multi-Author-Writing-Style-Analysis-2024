Eh, well I don't remember when, but there was a time (in the US) where you didn't have to register handguns, they were just a thing you might have, like a hammer or an umbrella. I believe it's fine to have an "unregistered handgun" in many states. They are registered automatically when you buy them.
Well, it's a voluntary weapon disposal program, with apparently the possibility to get a permit for the weapon. Though yes ... why should you have to go pay and ask for a permit for something that is already yours?
In any case, it doesn't seem like it's a forced confiscation or anything, just reminding and asking people to hand over old guns.
Edit: Now, I'm not saying they should treat firearms like the U.S. does, but I am implying that they should probably let the heirloom weapons confiscation slide a bit.
In all reality 99% of these heirlooms probably donâ€™t even have ammo to go with. Anyone that wants to use one for harm will have to source illegally obtained ammunition and anyone that has illegally obtained ammunition probably already has a smuggled or homemade gun to go with it.
