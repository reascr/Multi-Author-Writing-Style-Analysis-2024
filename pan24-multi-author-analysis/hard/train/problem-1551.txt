I'd rather have "internal strife" in Russia than Russian genocide in Ukraine. Either way Russia really needs to sort out what happens next when Putin is gone, and I hope the people get their democracy back someday.
It’s also irrelevant - it’s not like he dies in the next x months and the Russian state suddenly reversed course and becomes a positive, democratic force in the world.
Weirdly, I'm not sure the breakup of the Russian Federation, while possibly inevitable, would be on net good for geopolitics, especially if it happened fast. My fingers-crossed dream is that if Putin were to die, that whole era of Russian politics would die with him, and the political successors in Russia would be willing to cooperate with the West even on just one thing: containment of China. If, on the other hand, Russia breaks up (nuclear weapons concerns aside), I give it a minimum 50% chance that Siberia will be called "China" (or at least be a Chinese puppet state) 10 years from then.
And the former-Russian nuclear stockpile will start looking like the former-Soviet nuclear stockpile: rather fuzzy and unaccounted for.
This may be entirely real. But we live in a world of war propaganda, and Russia isn't the only player in the propaganda game. I'll believe it when he keels over.
