Club Q fuckin devastated me dude. I can’t describe to you the horror a trans person feels when one of us dies—let alone two. I’m often overcome by grief from trans people I lost like seven years ago. When it’s someone just like you, it just splits your soul into a billion little pieces. It’s so devastating and the silence has almost killed me at least once.
There’s so much that needs to be done. We need so much fucking help right now. Numerous states are trying to violently outlaw our existence every day. We’re all struggling & growing more terrified each day.
We’re in the crosshairs of the richest Transphobe on Earth. I was forced to delete my account after calling out some major transphobia. People started calling me a mentally ill groomer and shit. I had to delete my account. It’s not safe there for me anymore.
Safe to say that isn’t a risk so run. Nevertheless I’ve had a twitter account for well over a decade and I’ve only really been doing “content creation” as a responsibility the past few years. I’d rather become successful at short form blogging in the Twitter style on a platform that isn’t occupied fascist territory than even experiment at improving on Twitter.
