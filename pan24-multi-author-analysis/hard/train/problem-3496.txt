(Reuters) - Russia's defence minister said on Tuesday that Western arms supplies to Ukraine were effectively dragging NATO into the conflict, warning this could lead to an "unpredictable" escalation.
The more russia whines about escalation and nothing happens the more likely NATO is to help Ukraine because russia never acts on their hollow threats anyway.
If this upwards trend keeps going for years i wouldn't be surprised if we eventually saw a country sending in their army to defend Ukraine directly.
"To do this, they have started supplying heavy offensive weapons, openly urging Ukraine to seize our territories. In fact, such steps are dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of escalation.".
Here's the thing. Russia has escalated every chance they've gotten. They didn't start out by bombing civs. But they are now cause they've an easier target. They've escalated the rhetoric. They tried to escalate the pressure on ukraine. So, at this point. We dont care.
