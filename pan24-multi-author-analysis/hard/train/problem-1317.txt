After spending years doing everything he could to piss off other major foreign powers with blatantly public shows of disregard for international relations. Can't say it's all that surprising that so many governments jumped at the chance to supply Ukraine, and that their decisions to do so have been met with generally positive feedback from their citizens.
In a situation like this, were things are so dependent on everybody's willingness to put themselves on the line for the good of all, Ukraine was pretty damn lucky that the guy they had in power turned out to be a natural leader.
True leaders make others want to do something, not be forced to do it (by money, by a sense of duty, due to social pressures and so on) and as I said, in a life and death situation the former is vastly superior to the latter.
Sure, you can still be the formal, nominated, Leader - what in a business environment would be called "the boss" - without sticking around when the going gets tough, but not actually somebody to whom others naturally look for leadership.
That's what I mean by "formal Leader": a person nominated to have the responsability to tell others what to do, not a person others look to for leadership.
