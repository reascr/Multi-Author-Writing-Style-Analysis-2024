I’ll respectfully remind the Republican candidates that they’re the ones who didn’t want to use electronic voting and want us to go back to counting paper ballots by hand.
I couldn't imagine the elderly people who move here to retire all wanting to switch to voting in person if the vocal republicans got their way lol According to the site below idk when it was created so maybe it's even higher now but it says that 80% of az voters vote by mail in ballot.
What does Brazil have to do with the US midterms? Mail in ballots are ballots lol Arizona has been using mail in ballots for over 30 years. No one claimed it was an issue before the last election, what a coincidence.
Yeah I think I've only voted once in person since my first election for the 2008 election. And I only did it that one time because I forgot to fill in my ballot and my dad was going to vote in person anyways lol.
I happen to vote in person every time, and I don't think I've ever seen a poll worker under 70 years old. The idea that these people were rigging the election for the Democrats is such a laughably pathetic accusation.
Like you said, nobody ever questioned the integrity of our elections until Trump came along. In fact, it used to be a point of pride for our state that we had such modern voting systems compared to many other states.
