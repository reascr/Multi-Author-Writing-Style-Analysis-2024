Pretty much universally from what I've read Omnicron is generally considered less serious or on par then Delta from sources I've looked at, e.g. the one I linked above being from November. Delta generally did more damage in part due to vaccines being less widespread and treatments being less mature. This is generally what makes it difficult to determine if Omnicron is on par or lesser then Delta. Then you have mutations in Omnicron making vaccines and past infections provide less protection. So comparison are generally a complete mess due to so many uncontrolled variables.
China has a antivaxers problem in it's older generation who don't trust the government and also even if they are vaccinated the quality of the vaccines are not great and many countries who used Chinese one revaccinated people with western ones.
Important to remember Covid is more deadly now so unvaccinated old people are dying at a higher rate now if they don't get proper healthcare, which is hard to get even in the USA.
A functionally unvaccinated population that's lifting quarantine rules that also has some of the oldest citizens on earth? Nah, COVID wouldn't cut through them like a hot knife through butter.
