Could be lots of reasons why they'd hate Fox despite being right leaning, but a popular reason is because Fox was the first to call Arizona for Biden in 2020. And that really, really pissed a lot of conservatives off. I think a lot of them never got over that because they saw it as a massive betrayal.
"But Trump was winning by a huge margin before all the mail-in votes came in and conveniently gave Biden the lead. How is that not fraud?".
P.S. Perhaps all of the 1/6 "tourists" should also consider suing Fox News since their propagation of lies most likely led them into believing the election was stolen, etc., etc., etc.
So.... how the fck can crap like this be allowed to happen? I understand "freedom of speech", but you can't go into a crowded theater screaming fire. Isn't blatantly lying about topics like this the same thing, especially when you have a audience of MILLIONS of people who trust you?
It's a very telling thing they would mock these claims and people but have a low enough opinion of their audience that they would think they would believe such ridiculous claims.
It will be a bummer if their audience who followed these claims donâ€™t realize the idiocy of their ways upon reading this news. Anybody who sees evidence of their views being mocked by the very people who convinced them in the first place need took take a serious look at what they actually care about.
