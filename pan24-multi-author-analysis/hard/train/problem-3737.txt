If there was any evidence of serious criminal activity by Hunter Biden, that would be the FBI's job to investigate him as an ordinary citizen. And they would have already acted on it since they have possession of "the laptop" that far-right tabloids love to vaguely claim contains "evidence".
Instead we get some congressional circus to baselessly drag out some guy's browser history in public to humiliate and slander his father.
It's hilarious that they want to "investigate" Hunter Biden, someone who does not and has never held public office. Effectively just a random citizen who happens to be related to a politician. Yet they were all publicly horrified at the idea of questioning Trump's adult children who were in influential administration positions and paid with tax dollars.
What about the 2 billion reasons we should be investigating Trump’s kid and son-in-law that actually were a part of his administration. Isn’t that a part of the public interest if we need to look at what the kids of the family are doing?
