One doesn't have the imagination to lie about such a threat. There's virtually no point in saying such a stupid insult if it isn't simply true. He has nothing to gain by lying about Putin being "someone push that guy out a hospital window" (and someone obeys the order)) sort of leader...
I know he's a lying deceptive arse, but at no point has he even remotely sided with Russia during this war.
Mr Peskiv said, "...or it was an unconscious lie and he did not in fact understand what Putin was talking to him about".
Yep, and? That doesn't negate what I said, just adds that they are claiming both that it's a lie and might not be a lie.
Lying liar accused of lying (yet again). Who would have thought? We have months of bullshit front pages about Johnson to look forward to. Every newspaper that put his claims on the front page today will do the same in a few days/weeks/months with headlines like “Boris: I begged Sunak to save drowning refugees but he said ‘screw em’” “Boris: I wanted to do more about poverty but top Tories refused to let me resolve energy cost crisis”. Blah blah blah.
