Come on, Switzerland. You can do better. There are alot more than $8 billion of Russian assets in the Swiss banks, probably more than $8 billion of Russian origin on each of big Swiss banks starting from UBS, Credit Suisse, and bunch of private banks with names ordinary people never even heard of.
As with their EU counterparts, Swiss banks are banned from accepting deposits from Russian nationals or people or entities based in Russia of more than 100,000 francs, and have been ordered to declare all existing deposits over that amount.
The secretariat stressed that “the level of reported deposits … can therefore not be equated with the total amount of funds of Russian origin held in Switzerland.”.
GENEVA, Switzerland — Switzerland said Thursday that it has to date frozen a total of 7.5 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion) in Russian assets, in connection with the sanctions imposed over Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Switzerland, a favored destination for wealthy Russians and their assets, has also seen 15 Russian properties seized, it said.
