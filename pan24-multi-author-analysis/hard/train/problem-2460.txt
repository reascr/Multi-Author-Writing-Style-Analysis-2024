Russia will not attack the US and Europe as long as NATO exists. NATO doesn't want war with Russia (as evidenced by how they turned down a perfect opportunity to use the Poland missile incident as cause for war), and Russia is terrified of actually having to face NATO with more than just words and conspiracy theories (see: how they praised the US for its "restraint and professionalism" in the response to the missile incident).
Because we have confirmation from the Ukrainian and UK MoD about their missile stocks getting depleted, because we have confirmation of drone attacks that forced their fleet to stay on secured docks and Russia seeking security guarantees for their fleet on the grain deal, because we have confirmation that Obama era sanctions greatly reduced their ability to make modern weaponry and recent ones just killed it?.
They are depleting their missile stocks (With the exception of the cheaper ones which they still have in high numbers) and I believe NATO already have the data they need about their hypersonic missiles.
The only things they have left are nukes, subs and their airforce which for some reason is equally a threat for NATO and Russia because you don't know when it's gonna fail and crash on an appartment building.
This war exposed the russian armed forces as the joke that they are and the russian junta can't do shit to bring them back on track.
As for their claim, well I don't think the Russians would be able to mobilize a proper ground force for a long time.
I highly doubt they will be able to replace all the tanks, arty, armor and logistic vehicles they have lost any time soon.
