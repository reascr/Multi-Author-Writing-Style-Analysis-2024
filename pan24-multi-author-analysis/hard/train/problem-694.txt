We all know the bad guys in this whole situation are the dog owners, followed closely by this weird obsession for and against pitbulls.
There is such a bad stigma around pitbulls that they are often unwanted/discriminated against, a byproduct of this is that they are the most common dog found at shelters. Now that they are the most common and affordable dog, a lot of the adopters aren't going to do any proper training. Some of those untrained dogs will go right back to the shelter willy nilly because there wasn't much of an investment to adopt them to begin with. It's really a vicious cycle.
It's really easy to say "shitbulls" or "all pitbulls are fucking trash" but its not easy to ask and understand why these things are happening.
I personally try not to make huge sweeping generalizations. Humans are to be blamed for breeding those dogs to be what they are today. I don't know how much dog fighting is still going on but there shouldn't be any more mainstream breeding programs for that. The aggression that was selectively bred for will eventually be naturally bred out. It's going to take a lot of time.
