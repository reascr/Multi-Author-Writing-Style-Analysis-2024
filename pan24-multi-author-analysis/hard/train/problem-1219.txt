My parents live in Texas and keep voting for republicans. They basically complain about the problems and try their best to bury their hair in the sand. Even if the are somewhat disgruntled and want changes, when it comes time to vote they succumb to the fear mongering about gay marriage, abortion, drag queens or whatever the current party line hate is and keep voting for the same people who are actively taking advantage of them.
Doesn’t help that they have gerrymandered Texas into oblivion so even when new representation is wanted, it’s difficult to get due to decades of GOP redrawing lines to choose their own voters.
ITT: people so desperate to own the Republicans that they're willing to write off the blue cities of Texas most impacted by this who keep trying desperately to change things and who keep getting assfucked by GOP policies like limiting early voting and mandating only one ballot drop box per county.
As a blue dot living in Alabama, I feel very sorry for the good people of Texas who want something better than a Republican shit show for their government.
