What I'm worried about most is Putin becoming cornered, deciding he has nothing left to lose and trying to take out the entire world with him on his way out.
"Russia promises when it is forced to, and fails to keep its promises the moment it has the power to do so.".
Yep. We're currently at the stage of Russia using convicts and 'undesirable' minorities to fight a war with equipment loaned from Iran and NK because Russia can no longer field a modern military on its own.
As a result of all this, Russia will—more and more—need to rely on Cold War era weapons, which means their soldiers will find themselves outgunned against modern, western weapons sent to Ukraine by NATO-affiliated nations. My own country’s Military Industrial Complex™ is loving the idea of having their weapons tested in the field just as much as they are loving that sweet cash rolling into their bank accounts, and that cash will be used to change the minds of anyone serving in public office who might be considering pulling some support for Ukraine; the weapons shipments will not stop.
If you’re reading this, are living in Russia, and want a tip on a good investment, I’d say invest in body bags. I’m not joking. They’re easy to manufacture, require no special tooling (so sanctions should have no effect), and your country is going to need a lot of them as Putin sends more of your sons to be killed in Ukraine. That’s the cold, hard truth.
