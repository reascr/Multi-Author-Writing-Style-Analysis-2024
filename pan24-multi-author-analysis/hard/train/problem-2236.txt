Are you saying I’m delusional if I don’t believe the party that hasn’t gotten a new president in via popular vote in over 30 years represents “at least half” of the population?
You’re projecting because you want to claim I’m wrong for saying that at least half the voters out there are voting republican, that somehow republicans are winning some other way. So maybe it’s your reality that’s skewed.
The reality is the pendulum swings nearly every election cycle and if there were no interests the GOP didn’t represent they wouldn’t dominate congress and senate as often as they do.
Complain all you want about differences in political ideologies and agendas but to claim an entire political establishment that represents at least half of the population wants journalists dead is not only inaccurate, it’s inflammatory.
A very loud minority that calls journalists enemy of the people is not half the population nor inaccurate to blame republicans for the aftermath of their rhetoric. The only thing inflammatory is the ignorance not to see the connection between the shit republicans say and the violent actions their domestic terrorist base act out.
