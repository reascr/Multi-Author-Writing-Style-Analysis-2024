This reminds me of the story about the billionaires prepping for the apocalypse by building huge bunkers and hiring private security, but realizing once the apocalypse has happened and they're safely in their bunkers that the security doesn't need them anymore and worried how to stay in power.
>More questions came about these guards, like 'How would you pay them once crypto was worthless? What would stop them from eventually choosing their own leader? Perhaps robot guards would be better?'.
It is. Traffic acts like it has the right of way and cyclists and pedestrians have no choice but to dive for safety at times.
People do cycle and/but you just know in the back of your mind it could become an adrenaline producing situation at any point.
If Plaza Vea is across the street and the person you're crossing with is old or disabled you're waiting for a nice big opening. Could be there a while.
I wonder what does happen then. I don't think the folks who try bunker down will have any greater success long-term tbh.
