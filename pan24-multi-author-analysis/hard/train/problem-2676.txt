not sure why you're getting downvoted, because that same thought has crossed my mind. Surely a knife assassination or the good ol' bomb under the conference table trick isn't totally impossible in the USSR...
"...borrow nearly $12 billion from his own citizens..." haha ü§£ oh man my sides HAHAHAHA borrow hehehahahah BORROW haha heh ahahaa ... surely the article meant "STEAL" or misappropriate maybe embezzle ü§£ no wait that's not it pillage or maybe swindle or ransom ... ... wait wait wait - steal implies that there was actually anything there to take so - really - defraud, scam, cheat ... hmm.
Maybe the countries that allowed all the male youth to run away from the draft will cancel their visas and send them back home. I do hope there is some fight left in the citizenry because Putin has to go and I don't see NATO doing anything about it ...
I do feel bad for all the babushkas out in rural bumvuknowherski waiting outside for bread and their daily trips to the village water pump. It's going to be a rough winter, I'm afraid... I'm sorry to say that I do blame Russians for Russia and Russia's actions for DECADES around the world.
I wonder if the Russian population believes they are in the right..I hate to throw around ‚Äúwhat about-isms‚Äù but like with The US and Iraq. As a American I was young but remember post 9/11 clearly. After that when we heard the false information of WMD‚Äôs and that they were a threat to us I feel like the majority of the nation was more then on board for an all out ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù offensive. Given the climate of post 9/11, terror attacks in the US And Europe, anthrax, Open threats from Terrorist groups. It was a no brainer. Shock and Awe was perfectly used we were willing and ready to wage war on people we believed wanted and were actively trying to..we‚Äôll massacre us. Idk I know this has no correlation to the Russians and Ukrainians but it makes you think.. I don‚Äôt look at Iraqi war veterans in a negative light at all..they answered the call to defend our country from what we all believed the be a legitimate threat to our very existence. What I‚Äôm trying to say is do the majority of people who aren‚Äôt currently fighting in Russia what‚Äôs stopping them from believing they are in the right if that‚Äôs the information they are given? Like I said two very different situations with the US and Iraq but I‚Äôm speaking of the information factor. How do you combat that? Or with todays tech do u think they have the access to the truth but just..not do anything about their genocidal invasion? I just can‚Äôt imagine regardless of your nationality how things like Ukraine and currently Iran happen..the number of people willing to commit murder on the behave of dictators for no feasible reasons. Idk I‚Äôm stoned and there‚Äôs a lot going on to think about it‚Äôs 2022 and look at the state of the world..wonder if the day ever comes countries all just find a balance. thrive in their cultures and religions while maintaining peace within the borders of the world. The trillions upon trillions of dollars an unimaginable about of possibility‚Äôs for the Human race. We could literally in this moment in time with the resources we have and the brilliant minds carve out a chunk in the universes history book and for eons they would look back and ponder how we were able to do all these extraordinary things and be in a different type of shock and awe. I feel the time is coming for a huge change in the world. The younger generations are craving change, in todays sad and scary times I do have a good feeling about the future still. Alright my stoned ass is done peace and love to you all.
