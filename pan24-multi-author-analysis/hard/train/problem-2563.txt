Back to the Moon and beyond, this time to stay. I’m so happy to finally see Artemis I lift off, and with over 700,000 people watching the official NASA livestream even though it was almost 2 AM ET. In short: hell yeah!
The exciting bit isn’t that a rocket got sent to space. It’s that this is the first launch of the Artemis missions that will take people back to the Moon. They’re real now.
The reason this is so exciting is because it’s the first step to an actual manned mission. Artemis I is a test flight, Artemis II is a manned mission around the Moon, and Artemis III is a manned landing.
The Artemis program is the moon landing missions. Gateway and SLS predate it and Gateway isn't even on the critical path for the currently planned missions. If Starship fails, at least Artemis III and IV fail, if not the whole program.
Many are hoping that Starship will fail, without realising that if Starship fails Artemis will also fail. The program relies fully on Starship in the form of the lunar lander.
NASA is going to build a space station similar to ISS that will orbit the moon. Future missions to Mars will be sent from this Moon-orbiting space station. Reasoning is that sending a mission to Mars directly from Earth would waste too much fuel on simply trying to escape Earth's gravity. So first, a rocket will be sent to the Moon from Earth. After that, the same rocket will refuel at the Moon space station before continuing a long journey to Mars. This way, the people onboard the Mars mission could have enough fuel to orbit Mars, send down a manned lander, come back up, and return back home.
Interestingly it takes less fuel to land on Mars than it takes to land on the moon. That's because we can use the martian atmosphere to slow down. On the moon we have to use fuel.
And with so much more mass to play with the payloads could have been designed and manufactured for much less money.
