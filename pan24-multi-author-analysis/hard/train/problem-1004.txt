This is an issue of great concern and much importance to me. I have a hard time understanding the vituperative and hateful things I read on political forums. The author writes in the article: “The dream with One Small Step is that we convince the country it’s our patriotic duty to see the humanity in people with whom we disagree, which is a complete moon shot.”.
I am not trying to make excuses for bad actors. I was trying to see if political discussions could be more civilized.
Let’s all try to make political discussions reasonable and passionate. To discuss what is posted, not just make assumptions about people or their perspectives.
Some discussions are just for understanding. If you feel like someone has a motive, it's for exactly the reasons you outlined above, you aren't trying to understand you're trying to debate, correct, convince, etc. and if that's how you treat differing views, than naturally I'm going to question how many fruitful discussion you actually have.
Maybe the actual nature of the ideologies behind the politics can differ so much that there is no reasonable compromise.
And maybe just maybe their is an actual real world out there which can’t be changed by rhetoric and philosophizing and a political ideology that pretends otherwise is dangerous.
Here’s a crazy idea what if politics isn’t debate club or a chat at thanksgiving but a matter of life and death.
