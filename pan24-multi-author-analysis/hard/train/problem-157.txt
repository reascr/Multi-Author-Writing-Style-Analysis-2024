One of the things that pop culture gets wrong about the Multiverse is that, if the theory is true, then there are infinite alternative universes.
This is not true, just because an infinite amount of universes exists does not mean that all possible universes exists. For example, between 0 and 1 there’s an infinite amount of numbers (in fact a larger infinity than the amount of natural numbers or integers) but 2 is not one of the numbers between 0 and 1.
And that means that not only is anything that can be imagined, in some sense, actually real, but there is an infinite number of them.
This concentration of power gives the PMO the ability to craft and enact legislation, such that government can actually do things - unlike the crazy Yank deadlock that happens when one party throws all its toys out of the pram and chooses to just obstruct.
Well the Parliamentary system gives the ruling party the power to actually get things done, and I agree it’s more functional as you describe, but the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is too powerful within that.
