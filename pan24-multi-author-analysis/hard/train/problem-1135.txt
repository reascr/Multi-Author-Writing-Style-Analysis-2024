Yes, but not the Senate. Republicans were expected to have a massive landslide of victories that never happened. The most important thing that happened was Trump MAGA candidates were beaten badly across the US that will very much damage Trump and his attempt to run for president and make it impossible for Trump to launch another coup attempt if he loses in 2024.
MAGA meltdown time. I remember seeing on Facebook all these red wave memes and Republicans being so smug and confident of landslide victories that will help launch Trump's campaign and comeback for 2024.
The fact they will not hold positions of power in swing states for the next presidential election is a massive victory.
This is exactly why Republicans have been able gain power in recent elections. Republicans are known as to be reliable in every election. Do not become complacent with any election going forward. It shouldn’t take a SCOTUS decision to motivate you to do your civic duty. Your vote is your voice, and let it be heard.
I’m now of the mindset that I just vote. I view it as a civic duty no matter how blue my county/district/state are. I don’t want some assholes thinking they got a shot at messing with what we got going.
