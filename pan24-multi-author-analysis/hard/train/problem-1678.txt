That's so dumb but it's typical authoritarian false equivalence. Ozil was hated because he played like shit at the moment he was supposed to rise as the leader of the team. It had nothing with his ethnicity. Compare this to Qatar's treatment migrant workers. Thousands died to build stadium for the megalomaniac dictator of Qatar.
if you are idiotic enough to say "Qatar", Qatar spent more than that and it's to build Qatar itself, rather than the stadiums. The Qatari and Saudi teams are number 1 and 2 as the cheapest teams in the world cup. Qatar won the AFC Asia Cup, sadly they're playing like dogshit for some reason right now.
Thank you /u/Jacabon for creating and releasing the globally and universally agreed upon basic human rights, anyways, sorry for extending the argument more than it should've, I'll go have a good day, hope you do too.
This is the point of discussion really, anyways, I retire myself from this discussion please feel free to monologue on this echo chamber of a website, bye bye.
