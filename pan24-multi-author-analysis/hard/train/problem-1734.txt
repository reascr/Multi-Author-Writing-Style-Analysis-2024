End the policy of “Awww poor widdle baby with untweeted schizophwenia do you want some medications? No? You think I’m an alien and would rather smoke meth, cover yourself in your own shit and scream at children walking by? Well it would be vewwy vewwy mean of us to involuntarily commit you, and you seem to like it on this sidewalk, so you continue being your unique and special self.”.
This isn’t specific to Vancouver this is every western city with a homeless problem because literally all of them refuse to do those 3 things.
It's an inappropriate form of housing for the majority of homeless people. Asylum is a solution, but not a one-size-fits-all solution. It can exist alongside housing programs.
Housing is the most important factor. Forced treatment would help, but most homeless people aren't mentally ill enough for asylum.
Forced detox might help some people, but most would just go back to using especially if they can’t get help paying for housing. Not to mention the costs and legal implications.
