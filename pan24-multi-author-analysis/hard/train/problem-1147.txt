Funny how the men there can have uncovered heads and arms without the women going mad with lust for them. They must think that Muslim women have much more self control than Muslim men.
The thing about Islam is it's meant to control your thoughts, Like some 1984 shit. I still catch myself judging people or I'll think something bad is happening to me because of Allah's wrath. I've since become an agnostic though so I don't really think about God much. It's just hard getting the propaganda out of your head and forming your own thoughts, opinions, and beliefs.
Plenty of people run around with internalized beliefs they got from others (trully independent thinkers are as rare as it gets) whilst not trying to force those views on others.
Saying that it's "internalized misogyny" only provides an explanation for their beliefs but doesn't explain them wanting to forcefully impose said beliefs on others.
It doesn't matter if the beliefs of the female assholes who want to force their views on other people's bodies are internalized misoginy or not - those women have agency and are the ones CHOOSING to impose (or vote for those who would) those beliefs on others.
