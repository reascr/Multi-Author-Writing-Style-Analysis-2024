I'm confused. I've just google map'ed Uzbekistan, and they don't even share a border with Russia. They're past Kazakhstan.
To get to Uzbekistan, Russians have to go through Kazakhstan. Am I correct in undersstanding that Russians feel the need to be two countries away from Russia?
I'm sure plenty of individual Russians don't support the war. However, enough of them do that comments like "Russian people =\= Russian government" is misleading and letting them off the hook.
Just like I can’t lump all people who say they dislike all Russians equivalent with people that move goal posts in two comments, and vise versa.
So, you’re saying that several hundred thousand people that are either compelled to service or decided to make a living in the military, somehow represent all of more than 100 million Russians?
I’m not making any grand discoveries. I’m pointing out what’s obvious. Just like not all Americans support the war in Ukraine. Not all people supported the Iraq war and therefore should not have been treated the same as the rest who did support the war.
