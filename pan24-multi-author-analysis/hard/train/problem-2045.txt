If you think Putin isn't in an absolute state of panic over how he's going to wrap this up without getting tried for war crimes or admitting defeat, you haven't been paying attention.
We don't have to be the ones to remove or kill him. But there aren't many ways where this war ends with Putin still in power. And I think he knows that. I think he knows that his oligarchs are recognizing how much he fucked up.
Russians have known they're fucked, future-wise, for a while now. This is the last generation in which they will have enough 20-30 year olds to wage a major war. We're witnessing the last hurrah of what we know as the idea of Russia. It doesn't matter on a timescale of less than 3-5 years, depending on how quickly they sink into irrelevance, but for the purposes of this article, this war hasn't even fully escalated yet.
Combine that with a population that is historically used to autocracy, hard times, and suffering and you just don't get the internal upheaval you'd expect from a Western democracy in the same economic situation.
