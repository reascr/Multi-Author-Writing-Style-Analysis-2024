Yea well Rome commoners were pretty filthy. Nero had schizophrenia I believe as believed by scholars. He killed himself because of delusions and paranoia of his mom’s ghost that he murdered.
So I Have ADHD and my brain is naturall low on these chemicals. I am prescribed methamphetamine hydrochloride. I went from adderall ( a racemic 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine) easily the worst amphetamine stimulant drug out there with all the peripheral side effects, to 100% dextroamphetamine (dexedrine) much less side effects and more potent and then to methamphetamine hcl which is the smoothest of them all. It really helps out and most people don’t even realize that it’s still used today for medical purposes because of the stigma as a dirty street drug.
Hitler wasn’t just a meth head, his doctor really hooked him up with good shit. He was intravenously injected with a combo of cocaine, oxycodone and methamphetamine. A speedball. Hitler thought his doctor was the savior that cured all his ailments. That’s pretty much why hitler was making rash and stupid decisions from a military standpoint towards the end.
Hitler made terrible decisions before and all through the war because of his addiction to speed. I’m not sure he was ever not on speed when he was in public. When Orson Welles appeared on Dick Cavett show in the 70s he told a story about meeting Hitler and what an unremarkable person he was to the extent he barely remembered him. Hitlers entire personality changed at some point and was probably due to his massive and long term drug use.
Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich, by Norman Ohler is a really great book on Hitler & Nazi Germany's rampant methamphetamine use. It's fascinating. The sections about Hitler's personal doctor and his spiked pig's blood transfusions are insane.
