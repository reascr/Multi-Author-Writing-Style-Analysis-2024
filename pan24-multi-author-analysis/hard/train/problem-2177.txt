"The Nordic Passport Union allows citizens of the Nordic countries – Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland – to travel and reside in another Nordic country without any travel documentation (e.g. a passport or national identity card) or a residence permit.".
Hey Sweden. Your citizens are part of the Nordic Agreement (Can move to any Nordic country with no questions asked) - tell the 73 to come to Norway or Denmark while Erdogan is having his tantrums.
Given that I have been proponent of Finlands Nato membership for 20+ years I have to say that Erdogan is making the oppositions points very valid and I am starting to have doubts myself.
If you take your values for democracy and the rule of law serious, there is no place for Erdoganisis and Orbanistan in NATO and EU.
Erdogan also has a bone to pick with a lot of nato countries harboring turkish political refugees/diaspora, and Sweden is the only country that he has leverage over.
Given that he right now wants us to change our country’s laws for his sake, and that Sweden isn’t in need of immediate Nato entry, I personally don’t believe we will reach a deal. The whole point of joining nato is to avoid being told what to do by foreign strongmen dictators.
