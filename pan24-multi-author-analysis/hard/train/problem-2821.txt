Yeah man, my family will tell anyone who’ll listen the rights of like the US or EU need to be cherished because it is EASY to lose rights you once held for granted. It’s really hard to get those rights back.
So hard, in fact, that my country hasn’t successfully gotten those lost rights back. So many innocent people have to truly suffer and risk everything to try to get them back.
They both face the same risk though don’t they? Getting murdered by the regime? They should both be honored imo, plenty of men have died for the cause as well.
I agree with you on that, there is certainly a lot more they can do (and have done) to women than men. But at the same time, both men and women face death for protesting, it’s just my personal opinion that the men who have died for the rights of others should be recognized for that sacrifice as well. Either way as you pretty much said, our opinions as non-Iranians mean jack shit regardless.
no one in Iran is even mentioning gender it's all you people outside Iran doing this shit. everyone is United here it's not a gender war.
this isn't about gender. no man in Iran has any problems about the main slogan of this protests being "women life freedom".
"To the women of Iran, who have been at the forefront of the struggle for freedom in Iran and the region: the world has finally heard you. To Iranians, you are heroes. To the world, you are shining examples of courage & righteousness. Victory is yours and closer than ever before.".
They are recognized obviously. In fact tomorrow there is going to be a massive crowd for a memorial of a young man who was killed.
I dont think u realize how significant this movement is and how big of a role women played to keep it alive. If they hadn't come to the streets and burnt their scarves and cut their hairs in the first few days , the movement would be dead.
