Like, this is flooring the hell out of me. Russia’s superpower/great power status has seemingly evaporated.
My personal question here is how did almost all Western military analysts completely overestimate Russian strenh and capability?
I think there is a repeated sense of preferring to overestimate enemies than underestimate them but this is compounded by the fact that Russian forces regularly lie up and down the chain. Western intelligence seems like they’ve gathered some intelligence directly from mid or even high level Russian sources but if all those reports were wildly optimistic for Russia and the west generally assumed competence then it’s easier to say how they got it so wrong.
I'd wager that even if signs pointed to Russia's now obvious problems, the West still would have overestimated just because it's better to be overreacted than under.
So they’ve made a massive miscalculation in trying to make Russia great, again The’ve destroy what they already have.
Russia is definitely not the military power we thought they were. I was listening to radio four they have less than 65 operational tanks!
