It sounds like a lot but for what job? Especially when you take into account that a lot of the federal jobs in DC are at an agency's headquarters, and thus that it's for more senior personnel.
The starting salary for someone with a bachelor's is like $45k in the federal government. It's a bit more for some degrees than others but it includes engineers and scientists. For someone with a PhD it's about $75k. That's very low for many technical degrees.
There are jobs for which the federal government pays more - mostly at the lower end of the salaries. But if you're a professional working for the state or federal government, you're underpaid.
Yeah but working for the federal government you should have a mechanism to compensate you for working that much (comp time/overtime). I have engineer that have worked 10-12 hour days since we graduated 5 years ago for base salary lol.
Not to mention as a fed the work is SLOW paced (and I work in a “fast paced” sector), guaranteed vacation/sick days, and I can’t get fired. I see coworkers literally do nothing / fall asleep and get away with it. The contractors that work for the fed are all very mediocre too.
