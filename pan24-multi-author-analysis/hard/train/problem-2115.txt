I am convinced that change is going to have to happen at a genetic level before people will ever be able to sort themselves out on any sort of large scale.

eesh. Take your damn upvote. Personally I have never voted for a Brazilian white supremacist, and anti trans drag artist, a pathological liar wholly unqualified to govern, someone who steals from sick dogs, or anyone who uses Jewish names to up their go fund me haul...but clearly someone has. It's the direct result of shitting on public schools for 30 years. An entire nation of dullards who can't count change, think the world is flat, and type "alot.".
I read that. Just sucks because we’re sending over all of these bills that require honor and integrity to pass, and half our legislature is full of grifters with no moral compass.
No I know we’re on the same page. I’m just so baffled and just, I don’t know. Disheartened, pretty much all of the time. I’m sad and angry for not only my generation, but kids right now who may or may not have an authoritarian, theocratic government in the US, if we can survive this invasion. I vote in all elections to do my part, just never feels like enough. And I think there should be an exception to this campaign finance and free speech if it harms national security.
