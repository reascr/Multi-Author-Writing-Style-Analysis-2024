I hate the sentiment that by not voting they can’t be blamed. No. Exactly the opposite. By not voting you are more at fault. Our democracy only works with participation otherwise what we’re seeing now happens. A minority rule is trying to subvert our system of government to give themselves total power. The village idiot is put in check by the majority. If the majority doesn’t care or can’t be bothered to care then the village idiot becomes the mayor.
That will be the real red wave. All of the candidates at each others necks. No mercy. To be the next trump you have to be aggressive otherwise the voters won’t see you as strong. The bar has been raised for them. They easily could have left him behind in favor of more traditional republicans like Liz Cheney but no. They want more crazy antics. So that’s what they’ll get.
Well the first is a recognised thing, so they'll get real replies. I expect that most of the CRT replies will be zero because it's largely a bogeyman made up by right wing politicians.
