True, but then the way the NK Government conducts itself and threatens the SK and the USA, while also oppressing its own people is the reason why sanctions are imposed.
From what I've read, while the sanctions do damage Russia's economy and do cause a certain level of unrest in the citizens, the real damage behind the sanctions is that Russia is unable to get equipment for modern weapons. Which makes sense considering that they now have to resort to buying stuff from Iran and North Korea.
I've seen other countries, mainly middle eastern ones, that have kind of killed off all of the other ways a country can normally make money, by being focused solely on nature resources, but I had no clue Russia was in this boat too. It gives a whole lot of insight into why Russia is doing this, they likely know in 10 or 20 years, a lot of those natural resources will become a lot less valuable.
Seriously, the USSR was vast and I think Russia is riding on that reputation, with the understanding they could still access those resources. Ukraine has popped that dream bubble, and the inner rot of a Dictatorship is showing.
