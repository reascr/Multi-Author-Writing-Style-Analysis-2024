How come 370,000 people in the Dakota's get twice the representation as 3.6 million people in California?
I don't think it can be described as perfect when you get a tiny portion of people who can control the narrative.
But you don’t get a tiny portion of people controlling the narrative. You’re missing that there’s a second house. The Senate is important because it gives people in small states a more equal voice.
with the caveat that we do have something of an oligarchy which is a tyranny of the financial minority. But that has nothing to do with this discussion.
Direct Democracy would be insane in a country with over 330 million. For a Representative Democracy, the current system works well to prevent tyranny of the majority or the minority.
That is because it is more of a representative democracy than a direct democracy. We have ballot measures for direct democracy although those tend to work poorly because direct democracy works poorly. Understanding policy is a full time job which most people don’t have the time or interest to do. As a result, people here elect a person who they feel can spend the time to understand the policy in their place.
