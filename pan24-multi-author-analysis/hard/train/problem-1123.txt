India's supreme court will take a case seeking the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.
It's legalized through constitutional review by the supreme court, the exact same way India is doing in this article. Only they did it sooner.
People also misunderstand the culture around Hijra and associate them with transgender people when culturally Hijra is an extremely poorly treated cast with some mild "accepted" rituals around charity and weddings. They're also not reflective of the situation with transgender individuals in the same country as they're pretty different in life goals, outcomes, and possibilities.
Also goes without saying that Indias social and political relationship with its Transgender/“Third Gender” community is pretty distinct from much of the region.
Actually India's transgender/third gender relations are pretty bog standard if not worse for south east asia. Although significantly better than the islamic world which use to have a similar relationship but mostly destroyed it.
