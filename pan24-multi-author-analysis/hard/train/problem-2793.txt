The DOD actually did this to Juliane Assange's PhD dissertation (preventing him from graduating) which is why Assange has a hard on for the US government.
Point being: the DOD could take every critical patent Musk owns and classify it on national security grounds, and then they could deny Musk security clearance to his own discoveries, forcing him to hand over his company to a CEO that the DOD will give clearance to. If they deem Musk to be a security risk, they can force him out of his companies altogether simply by classifying the underlying technologies.
Musk is an absolute moron to try and pick a fight with this guy after he brought up a legitimate security concerns with Musk's product. If Musk was the genius his fanboys constantly say he is, Markey should be like the guy on Musk's side in the Senate.
Musk has done so much stupid shit at this point that it’s painfully obvious that he gets nothing but praise that’s bought and paid for.
Note: This is not a comment in support of Musk. Just an observation that he uses his enormous money to destroy things in his way.
