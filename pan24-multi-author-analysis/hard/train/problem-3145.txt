I'm an attorney that worked at a White Shoe firm. Nose candy was everywhere, shamelessly. I was still a small town kid at heart and perhaps regrettably didn't partake. It was a bit odd to me at the time, but now I know how common it is. Fwiw, I didn't work at that firm in the 80's either.
I feel like Zelensky will leave a greater legacy if he finds a way to allow Putin's Russia to save face while quietly backing out. It isn't a perfect solution by any stretch. The cost/benefit analysis is clear to me though. If Putin has little to live for (whether that be factual or psychosis), a disgraced/dying man with his power presents too great a threat to the globe as a whole. It's only called appeasement when it doesn't work. JFK didn't appease Russia when deciding to remove American offensive weapons from Turkish borders to resolve the Cuban missile crisis.
You are spot on and that is what scares me. I loathe dictators but I also don't want to risk Putin forced into desperation to the point where nuclear escalation starts to seem like a reasonable yolo play.
...as he acts in such an unstable manner-not the invasion either, I'm talking about his fucked up rants and actually being the only idiot on earth besides Kim who directly threatens nukes.
Seeing a paper written from his doctor would be the "hard evidence" but at this point it wouldn't even add to what we know in the public.
You can't just keep posting documented proof and expecting everyone to believe it if they don't want to...
