Give them an inch and they will take a mile, as they say. It's hard for countries not to act in their best interests if they're given leeway to operate in this kind of situation. With Iran, there's even the concrete example of what happened when they tried nationalizing their oil industry.
I don't really have a solution; I just wish them the best, the best of luck, and that they can achieve their goals with the least amount of violence necessary.
It pains me to say this, though, because as a Brazilian atheist, I'd really love to see the people of Iran to overthrow their theocratic state, which is currently oppressing groups of their society. But I understand what's like to have a government associated with foreign powers, and how if that happened, it'd (most likely) make things harder rather than easier in the long run. Detractors of progressivism would just forever point to the association with imperialist countries that have fucked them over in the past. It should all ideally be done by Iranians.
Hi I’m an Iranian in the diaspora. I’m reposting stuff from a previous comment because it feels appropriate.
I can also direct you to the Iranian activists and accounts to follow if you want to stay informed. Instagram and social media is how we are primarily spreading information. People to follow are Tara Grammy, Nazanin Nour, Nazanin Boniadi, and Masih Alinejad. Accounts to follow are @middleeastmatters , @iraniandiasporacollective, and @from_iran .
PS Due to sanctions, it is not possible to send money. We are literally not asking for a cent of your money, just an ounce of your attention. If someone is trying to raise money they are a scam. The only people who are raising money legitimately are those in the diaspora asking for donations to buy billboards and adspace to create awareness. That’s it.
