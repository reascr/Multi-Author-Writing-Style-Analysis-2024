Is it your position that religious people should not be in government? Surely that would greatly reduce the percentage of people qualified to be in government.
I certainly agree with you that "politicians promote policies that directly contradict their professed faiths....".
Considering how many "religious" politicians promote policies that directly contradict their professed faiths, i hardly consider that to be the real issue.
No, it was pointing out that someone can be both political and religious, and that being religious shouldn't conflict with their ability to be recognized politically. Biden is a politician but also religious. He's allowed to attend church. He's allowed to give a sermon in a church. To say otherwise is to insist that all politicians be atheists, which is itself a religious requirement in that it requires someone to not be religious.
Of course in reality if such a rule got passed they would try and argue that Christian religious expressions are just normal and not religious and only try to stop non Christianâ€™s from expressing their beliefs.
But, as I mentioned earlier, i am perfectly fine with using religion to communicate with religious people, and these assholes need to stop using the Lord's name in vain when it comes to trying to excuse their own behavior, or act as if whatever bullshit they feel like doing is some kind of holy mission.
