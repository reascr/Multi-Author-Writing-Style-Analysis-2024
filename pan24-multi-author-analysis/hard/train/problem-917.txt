Reprisal by… whom? Russia? They dare no cut too much gas or petroleum. It’s their main income now I think. Russia won’t do anything to NATO and risk them fully joining the war. I agree with the rest though. You can’t simply jump in a fighter jet you’re not familiar with and expect to successfully fly it.
As learned from past conflicts, the training required for an active and experienced combat pilot to go from one plane to another takes way less time than in peace-time settings.
I would suspect an experienced Ukrainian Mig-29 driver would take around 2-3 weeks. A highly motivated pilot would want to learn faster than someone who was also thinking about his/her weekend plans with his pals or partner, whether or not he needs to buy a new pair or shoes, vs.someone worrying their their parents in Russian occupied northern Crimea or that their younger brother is MIA outside of Donetsk.
Well...that's not entirely accurate. There is a huge difference in training a pilot in peacetime settings to use the F-16 vs training a highly experienced UAF Mig-29 pilot who's been flying every day for 10 months in combat.
