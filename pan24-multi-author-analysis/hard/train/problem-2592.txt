We shall have peace... We shall have peace, when Putin answers for the burning of the Donbas, and the children that lie dead there We shall have peace, when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they died in the trenches of Bakhmut are avenged When Putin hangs from a gibbit for the sport of his own crows! Then we shall have peace.
There shall be peace... When the Russian army lies dead We shall have peace when Hague tries war criminals for the women and children of Kherson, and their sons that lie dead there When Putin hangs from a gibbet for the sport of his own crows, we shall have peace.
> Theoden : We shall have peace... We shall have peace, when you answer for the burning of the Westfold, and the children that lie dead there We shall have peace, when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they died against the gates of the Hornberg, are avenged When you hang from a gibbit for the sport of your own crows...! We shall have peace.
"Yes, we will have peace. We will have peace, when you and all your works have perished -- and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar, Putin, and a corrupter a men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of the KGB. Cruel and cold! Even if your war on me was just -- as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired -- even so, what will you say of your torches in Kyiv and the children that lie dead there?
When you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and Russia.".
