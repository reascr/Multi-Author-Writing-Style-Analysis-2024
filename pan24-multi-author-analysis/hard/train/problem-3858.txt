OPEC refused to increase supply; the US has stopped issuing oil drilling permits leases. I'd love for India to cut of Russian oil, but who else has enough to support the oil needs of a developing nation with 1.3 billion people?
However, if some rich investors were to come in and provide funding for oil alternatives (climate financing), India would be able to reduce its oil dependence and therefore its Russian oil imports.
Maybe if we had been keeping our promise this whole time, and didn't need to be reminded, India and other developing nations would have been in a better position to sanction Russian energy without putting their poor back into the stone age.

Yeah booo India for calling out other countries failing to fulfill their 10 year old promises, the same countries who got rich burning fossil fuels for decades and want to stop others doing the same.
But India has also said, which is hypocrisy at it's finest...India has called on rich countries to fulfil a decade-old promise to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance to developing nations. We shall buy it all and you shall pay for the climate. Thanks India.
