In 1933, the German Constitution was essentially repealed by the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, when he passed the Enabling Act that gave the Nazis total power through Hitler’s dictatorship.
If only there was a time in history that would warn us about autocratic leaders wanting to do away with the Constitution and rule of law?
What does worry me is a takeover by ‘legal means’, such as the Supreme Court degrading democracy so much that it is a farce. In that case, the military does still have an oath to the president/constitution (correct me if I’m wrong). If that president is accepted as legitimate by the masses, then yes they will be on their side.
A small portion of rural areas with psycho sheriffs might ‘stand down’ and let it happen. Other than that, I don’t see any significant defections occurring.
Harper vs Moore, etc. are the most worrying items to me at the moment. If they can ‘legitimize’ their takeover, then we are all fucked. Pretty sure that’s how the Nazi party did it, to be a bit reductive.
