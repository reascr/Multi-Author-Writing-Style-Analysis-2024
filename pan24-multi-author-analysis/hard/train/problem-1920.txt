The point is, this ideas can spread mostly because religion creates a f√©rtile enviroment for then, if we teached people to think, to analyze and use method to build world views we would be faar more advanced as Societies (but to be fair its not a religion but a power thing). Instead we get irrational humans with ground beliefs that defy reality and logic.
The only thing preventing Christians to being like extremists muslins is opportunity, if granted, it would be The same.
Ironically, this kind of shit is going to just galvanize the protestors as well as push a lot of them away from religion.
It's literally the same thing here with the Iranian government - "War against God" - this is nothing more than them attempting to scare the other protestors into submission.
Just in case you were unsure that Iran is run by a theocratic authoritarian bunch of repressed and angry at the world douchbags, here is confirmation for you. There are a lot of wonderful, beautiful, extremely intelligent, full of life and love people in Iran being violently oppressed, Some of whom had nothing to do with any protests or street actions, yet still are carted off to awful places and beaten and sometimes murdered. My heart is with the people of Iran. I hate their government, and what it does, but the people are not their government.
