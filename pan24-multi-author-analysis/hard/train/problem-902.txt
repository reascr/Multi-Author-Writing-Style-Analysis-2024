Jan 6 was OK for them because in their minds, THEY will never be attacked by a frothing mob of lunatics. Those cops beaten and trampled to death, THOSE were just the Democrat praetorian guard, those werent REAL cops like THEM, who will ALWAYS be swaddled by big papa fascism.
Every fascist is that. Literally that. The body grows but the limbic system doesnt. They do horrible things to.other people and never even do the smallest amount of brainwork to think about what it would feel like of it were done to them.
They all think theyre immune. Until theyre not. Then theyll cry and whine and scree like ittle bitty babies, as ALL the people Trump fucked over ALWAYS do when they realize the fascism is being done TO them.
Also its part of fascism that all these people implicitly assume theyll never be the VICTIMS of fascism.
How fascist of them It’s crazy they don’t support a party that vilifies them at every possible opportunity.
Real question: What can folks who reject the fascist direction this country is headed even do when the police are on the fascist’s side? The same goes for the military. If I get harassed by homophobic neighbors in a Republican-led country—which is bound to be rife with anti-LGBT legislation—what the fuck could I even do? I can’t call the police; they’d probably just escalate the harassment. It’s so scary and frustrating. It feels like the safest possible option for many non-MAGA people is to go to a blue state, but I don’t see myself and my husband making that happen before things get to a point where they could be really bad for us down here in fucking Florida.
