I guess a nuclear test seems logical. It would make Ukrainian allies a little more afraid of escalating. I don't support Russia. I'm just theorizing.
Do you all think Russia can afford to lose this war? How far do you think they're willing to go to accomplish their goals? At some point destroying too much infrastructure causes Ukrainian land to be diminished in value.
Reddit is full of a certain kind of people. If you aren't part of the hivemind, then you'll stick out like a sore thumb every now and again. I've gotten used to it.
Thanks! I definitely forgot about the buffer part. In the past I think both sides were trying to avoid influencing the buffer countries too much? There was a perception from Russia, real or not, that NATO was slowly advancing further east towards Russia.
Well, now that Russia has started conquering all the buffer nations - and has been for many years - I think there's a perception in the buffer nations that they need to get into NATO or get eaten. And it's not an unjustified perception, either.
