You personally might, but when you say “condemn this war” you’re still missing the point. You’re supposed to condemn the imperial country attacking their neighbor for no good reason. Condemning just the war is the official stance of India: blaming Ukraine for Russia attacking it.
Yes, the next Indo-Pak war will see many more countries siding with Pakistan bc of India's disasterous foreign policy since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
You, on the other hand, say that it was wrong for the West to engage in imperial wars but it is acceptable for Russia to do the same. And it was wrong for the West to profit from imperial wars, but it is right for India to do the same.
You condemn the West to have profited from imperial wars in the past, but say that India should not be condemned for profiting (if it really is, that is) from an imperial war today.
You criticise Western nations for having engaged in imperial wars in the past, but refuse to hold Russia accountable for its engaging in an imperial war today.
Your hypocrisy is worse than that which you implicitly allege of citizens in the West: we recognise that our past imperial wars were, and Russia's current imperial war is, wrong.
