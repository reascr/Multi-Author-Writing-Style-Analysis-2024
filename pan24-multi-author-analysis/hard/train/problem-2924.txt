The buzz is nethanyshu is planning to revive the Hashemite Kingdom proposal, of simply handing off the West Bank to Jordan (more like forcing them to take it at gunpoint). This is the response.
You think nethanyahu cares? He’s been pretty transparent in his intentions. Hell, he’s the one who violated Oslo by allowing settlements to start being built.
He did do it almost thirty years ago when he authorized the first settlements. The intent is to effectively colonize large parts of the west bank to the point that once any formal negotiation over border lines happens the Palestinians and the rest of the world won’t have any real choice but to just accept a redrawn boundary.
So, sure, somehow building settlements and stimulating the Palestinian economy (though that isn't their goal, obviously) is genocide. I'm sure another 30 years of settlement building and unsustainable Palestinian population growth will fulfill the Zionist agenda... which is...?
Palestine is one of the world's fastest growing populations, you may call settlement building 'genocide', but it's almost as effective a form of genocide as charities. Settlement industries are overwhelmingly filled with Palestinians. About a third of all Palestinians work in Israeli settlements or industries.
This has been Israeli strategy for 30+ years. They want to keep the situation as is, while slowly ethnically cleansing Palestinians, and building more and more illegal settlements. This sort of worked for them in the past, the old world order, but won’t work in the currently forming new world order.
