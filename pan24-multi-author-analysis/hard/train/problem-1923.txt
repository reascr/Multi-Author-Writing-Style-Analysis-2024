The GOP is going to make shit up to stoke rage regardless. A Democrat could merely exist and wear a tan suit and the entire base will be outraged by that evening.
Iâ€™d rather have them outraged about gas stoves than about other humans just trying to live their lives in the manner of their own choosing.
If you want to accuse gas stoves of poisoning people while they sleep, you have to implicate induction in burning people's houses down while they sleep.
The source study in no way has implied that gas stoves are poisoning people why they sleep. The implication is that inadequate ventilation of combustion products may contribute to childhood asthma.
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) was reported to be considering a ban on gas stoves over fears they cause indoor pollution linked to asthma in children.
There are probably innumerable irritants within the environment of the average home that are likely much more irritating to kids with asthma than gas stoves alone. I'd bet that mold and dirty air vents play a far bigger role. Some foods could be dietary 'triggers'.
