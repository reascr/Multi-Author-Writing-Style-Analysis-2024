Putin declared a unilateral ceasefire, which they violated after a couple hours. Ukraine wasn't required to accept it, and they probably didn't even have time to break it before russia did so.
It was just a pr stunt to try to put a blame Ukraine for not willing to make some peace. Never forget, putin did not asked for a ceasfire for ukranians holidays, he declared one for Russians holidays, like if they where entitled to. Second point, you can't unilaterally declare a ceasfire, that's illogical, you ask for one. And even if Ukraine would have agree, they would have broke it and blame Ukraine.
Didn't Ukraine not agree to any ceasefire? Not saying we can trust Russia, but there isn't any ceasefire to begin with since both parties never agreed.
If you’re proposing a ceasefire it needs to be underpinned by honesty and goodwill on both sides for it to work.
Ukraine flipped the bird because it was clear from the outset that putain was lying, like he lied when he said he’d allow humanitarian convoys in or out of key towns, like he lied when he said he wouldn’t interfere with grain movements, like he lied when he said he was de-nazifying Ukraine, like he lies when he denies having anything to do with the deaths of his critics, like he lied when he invaded and annexed Crimea, like he lied when he said troop build-ups were ‘exercises’ just before the invasion of Ukraine, like he lied about his army’s behaviour when hundreds of bodies were found in Bucha after weeks of Russian occupation.
