So yeah, currently, without the help of the oil majors like Shell, Total, Exxon and co. the Russian oil/gas is screwed, they climbed much higher because of the legal western help, but now without the parts, expertise, and overall culture of actually giving a damm, it is expected it will just all break down over time. Their aerospace industry is headed for a similar collapse (they can't even produce the rockets to send people to space anymore, SpaceX basically killed them on that front, RD180 never coming back, and Russian space program may very well cease to exist in under a decade).
Yes, when these sanctions were announced, everyone pretty much expected this outcome. Of course, naysayers were like "Russia can do it themselves???" ignoring the fact that even in the Cold War, Russia was relying on stolen western tech to keep their stuff operational.
Russia reaps the years of lies by creating a society built on mistrust of themselves, and it's biting them in the ass.
They, probably, will say, that it's Ukraine's work, but in reality, Russia just sucks and falls apart.
The commenter above you is saying that Ukraine has no more right to blow up civilian infrastructure in Russia than Russia has in Ukraine. It would be highly unethical for Ukraine to blow up power substations in Siberia just to hurt Russian civilians, even though Russia is doing exactly that in Ukraine.
That's a good point and that's why Ukraine has only been even remotely associated (afaik) with attacks on military infrastructureâ€”oil depots in Belgorod, Crimea bridge that was explicitly used for military transport and was empty of people at the time, those military research buildings near Moscow, etc. Not saying Ukraine is perfect by any means but they're keeping their hands very clean here.
