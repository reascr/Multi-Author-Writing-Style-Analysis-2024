Bibi is a pure political beast and the electorate of Israel has changed dramatically due to population trends. It's kinda like Idiocracy, but with religion. The various levels of orthodox Judaism is all about massive families and gaming the system. Where center and left leaning Jews tend to have smaller families. Mix in Bibi who will adapt to whoever gives him the power, and you get modern Israel.
The big inflection point will be when the collective Orthodox groups possibly crush the system with their population. They are generally pro-conflict but dodge conscription. They are big segment of the welfare population. And to avoid the conscription, many go into religious schooling. So they aren't generating as much gdp. At some point, there might be a large outflow of Israelis because the system is stacked in favor of Orthodoxy.
Most Israelis are against expanding settlements, it is being done to get the favor of the far-right. So most Israelis then vote far-right, which will most likely expand the settlements even further, which will fuel even more retaliation from palestine, and yes, that includes rocket launches and 'terror attacks" from the people whose land and homes Israel has illegally taken - which is what Israelis are so scared of that they keep electing the far right.
In the period where the majority of countries in the middle east have warm ties with israel and relations are the best theyve ever been they vote in the most right wing anti arab govt in israeli historyâ€¦ Probably not the best move.
With the way Israel demography has been developing, Israel's politics is only going to get more right-wing.
