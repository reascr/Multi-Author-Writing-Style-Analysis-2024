Why did he resign, and what was erroneous...does he believe they could have defended against the missile but failed? I don't quite get it, not enough context.
Is that the correct summary? Well everyone makes mistakes in these difficult circumstances, not sure resignation is particularly constructive during war times unless he's particularly incompetent?
Thank you, I am reading the sky news account of this...they say, that he had claimed the missile that blew up the building had been shot down by air defences. Russian propaganda used this as a way to blame the destruction on Ukrainian air defenses.
What I got from reading the news is earlier Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the building. However, now they say the building was hit after the Ukrainian air defense intercepted the Russian missile.
I believe he speculated initially that it was (and I'm not sure which) either an anti Air missile that crashed or a russian missile downed by aa but still intact.
He's an idiot who made a dumb statement that "it could have been that the missile that hit the building in Dnipro was due to our AA intercepting it" it was later confirmed by the Ukrainian army that the missile was not intercepted but the damage was done and russia already weaponised his statement.
