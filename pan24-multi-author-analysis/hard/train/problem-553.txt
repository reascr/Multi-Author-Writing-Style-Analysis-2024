My mother's family first appeared in CT in the late 1600s. There's a decent chance that I'm related to one of the witches after all this time. I don't feel the need for an apology.
I didn’t say the state had to apologize. Just saying there is/could have been an impact to descendants in terms of property and land rights confiscated that were never returned.
I’m a descendent of the last one accused and killed (a bit of confusion over her death we believe she was hung) in CT.
Just pointing it out. They were not witches, they were women (and sometimes men) that pissed off the wrong people or had something someone else wanted at a crazy time in history and they were tortured and killed for it. There’s no one to apologize to because they died.
Why does the State have to apologize? That's dumb. The State didn't exist then and even if it had, it was the localities that did these things - they should be the ones to apologize. And this, "It’s for the perpetrators and witch trial victim’s families here and now who want to make peace with this in some way..." - if these people are kept up at night because their ancestor was murdered 370+ years ago they need help. And I do have a relative from the early 1600s who was burned as a witch in Germany.
It could be that imrealwitch is a 375 year old witch accused at that time. Though if they are, the accusation of witchcraft was correct and the spell to become so long lived surely harmed other people.
