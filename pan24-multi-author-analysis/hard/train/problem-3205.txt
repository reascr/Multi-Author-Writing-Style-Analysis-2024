No member of the current court; much like the time we stole an election we do not intend this callous disregard for ethics and the constitution to be interpreted as precedent in case the court ever becomes liberal again.
What I find particularly hypocritical is that, the conservatives on the court are willing to come down on the side of: legislature can ignore the courts decisions.
Ignoring the law for a Supreme court justice, or for political reasons, would be more egregious than the crime itself.
It sucks, but there's no way to punish Clarence Thomas or any other SCOTUS judge for not recusing themselves when they obviously should. Our system is built on the assumption that the people involved in the government all have scruples and morals and ethics, and it really isn't equipped to deal with it when they don't. Our whole democracy is basically a gentleman's agreement, but that's pretty worthless if people don't voluntarily play by the rules.
The honest answer is that you need a large percentage of the population to start voting for Democrats in every election. I know that's not the answer anyone wants to hear, but that's really all there is short of a civil war of some kind. With more Dems elected they can get big enough majorities to vote for rule changes (like eliminating the filibuster, eliminating partisan gerrymandering or expanding the Supreme Court), and actually make meaningful change.
