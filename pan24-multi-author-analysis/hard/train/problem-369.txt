It seems many people are voting no because this ballot measure isn't perfect and one of those imperfections is that as an amendment they think it'll be very difficult to amend in the future, particularly if the federal government legalizes marijuana. That's a lot of assumptions. What will happen at the Fed level is difficult to be sure of, and what our federal representation will look like at the Fed level after Tuesdays vote and after the 2024 elections is yet difficult to know.
Correction: 8% of the votes in the previous gubernatorial in at least six of the eight congressional districts.
In the mean time Missouri does not have to continue to imprison individuals for personal use amounts of marijuana is this amendment is passed.
That’s a valid opinion, particularly if you only look at the objectives of legal recreational marijuana and pardons for people charged with less than 3lbs. Both of which are admirable goals. But in exchange, we’re having to commit to allegiance to a very small number of industry insiders instead of allowing a free market to prosper, one that allows people of color and mixed social-economic backgrounds to participate. This amendment comes at the exclusion of these entrepreneurs. Which should merit consideration by voters.
