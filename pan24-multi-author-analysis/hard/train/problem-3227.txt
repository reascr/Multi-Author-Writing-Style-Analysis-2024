Does anyone else remember the whole Maria Butina thing, where she got charged with espionage in a honeypot scheme that was ultimately aimed at funneling Russian money into Republican campaigns via the NRA?
I remember the Russian Spy, but the part about funneling Russian money into Republican campaigns via the NRA isn't accurate. Although that hasn't stopped people from repeating it over and over again:
Foreign agents who conduct such operations, Anderson continued, “are often not trained intelligence officers” because their movements and contacts” can present a high risk of exposure.
Butina was using the NRA to gain access to prominent politicians at social events, using the guise that they she was helping form a gun rights organization in Russia.
The crazy obvious issue with a Russian national having any sort of interaction with gun rights advocates is Russia has no like organization. There isn’t a correlating body which advocates for individual gun rights. That this isn’t suspicious to everyone is ridiculous.
