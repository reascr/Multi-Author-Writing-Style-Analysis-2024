It doesn't matter if you know it's a lie. It doesn't matter if I know it's a lie. It doesn't matter if every reasonable person knows it's a lie. You are trying to prove that the persona telling the lie did so knowingly.
Politicians lie. They've been famous for doing that for long before social media was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before the internet was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before television was a thing. They've been famous for doing that long before radio was a thing. People expect politicians to lie, but people accept what the news tell them is true.
If they're going to hide behind the claim that they are an opinion show, strip them of their ability to call themselves a "News Network". We have false advertising laws in this country and it would seem having a "Fox News" logo in the corner of Tucker Carlson's show, that his lawyers argued in court wasn't news, should fit into a claim of false advertising pretty nicely.
There's no problem with the government forcing "news" agencies to issue retractions their viewers/readers will actually see. There's no problem with the FCC saying "you've been misleading your viewers, either maliciously or mistakenly, too frequently, so you're either going to make it right, stop calling yourself "news", or well pull your broadcasting license.".
Good point. Take out "knowingly" and maybe these dipshits will start doing some fact checking before opening their stupid face holes, to avoid the consequences.
