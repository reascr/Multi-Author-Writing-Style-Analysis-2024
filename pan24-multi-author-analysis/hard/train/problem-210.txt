That's bold of Murdoch to come out and name names like that. Who do you think he had in mind? Wonder if there will be any repercussions for them or is this a case of money and power talking?
That's a pretty bold statement. I'm sure they have their evidence, but it's gonna take more than that to convince me. If they can't prove it, then this whole thing will just be another fake news story.
The fact that news anchors at Fox News did not endorse the false narratives doesn't help Fox. It makes it worse. Fox News correspondents and news anchors said the claims were false. The hosts mentioned would have learned that the theories were false by paying attention to the reporting of their own new network.
The actual news hosts at Fox did not like Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum, Chris Wallace, Eric Shawn, Shannon Bream etc. But that doesn't matter in this case. The Fox News hosts mentioned did endorse those false narratives. That fact makes Fox News as a whole liable. It occurred on their airwaves making them liable.
They didn't defend Bret Baier or Chris Wallace either. Those two are conservative leaning journalists who did the right thing.
I think if reporters don't act as recklessly as they did in the two cases I mentioned they will be fine.
