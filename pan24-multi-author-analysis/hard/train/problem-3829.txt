I'm really dubious about this argument, but to clarify it apparently the argument is that since female slaves were forced to reproduce, and the 13th Amendment made that practice unconstitutional, it gave black women constitutional control over whether or not to abort a pregnancy. And if black women have that right then so do other women under the 14th amendment.
So it's not really saying "parenting is slavery", it's more like "former slaves are constitutionally allowed to choose to have abortions so that right also extends to everybody else." (Again, I'm really skeptical about this argument, it sounds like a super stretch.).
Jeez. The Third Amendment has a better chance of protecting abortion rights than the 13th. Don't quarter fetuses in a womb without the owner's permission!
The argument is actually way more tenuous than that. Apparently, it's that because slaves were forced to reproduce to put more people into slavery, that the 13th Amendment grants Black women full constitutional authority to control their own reproduction. And because Black women have that right, the 14th amendment grants that right to everyone.
