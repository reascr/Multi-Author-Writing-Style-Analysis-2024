Hello r/politics! It is finally November 8th, 2022, the last day open to voting in this yearâ€™s midterm elections. If you have not yet voted, and are legally able to do so, we strongly encourage you to do your civic duty.

Can we please wait for polls to close before we start the doom and gloom? I know it's a rough and frankly scary day in general. But remember, old boomers and above don't work so they have plenty of time to vote early today. It happens at every election and they always vote on the red side of things so it will seem skewed to the right at the start.
A quick reminder: We ARE going to have to deal with people claiming the vote was rigged. In every election. In super-blue California House districts. In local judgeships lost because the candidate shot a local's dog.
