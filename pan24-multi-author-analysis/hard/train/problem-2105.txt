I'd be much more worried by what Gen.Milley said than anything the DM publishes. It may be that USA is more worried about it's ally Taiwan, and being unable to face China in a conflict as well as helping Ukraine at the same time. Even the remote possibility of war on 2 fronts will scare them...America really has no 'friends' only 'interests'.
It's almost too good to turn down, but unfortunately Putin is ideologically committed to his invasion and just won't accept any deal. I doubt the Ukrainian people would buy into it either, unless their troop losses are far greater than they have been told. At the end of the day Putin has, by comparison, a far greater pool to draw from, the fact that they can't be equipped doesn't seem to matter to him. The winter looks like it will me milder than normal which will benefit the Russians also.
...but Russia hasn't even been attacked. They've lost no civilians, no infrastructure and no land. Ukraine has admitted that they have no interest in seizing Russian territory. Nobody is even threatening Russia.
Exactly, Russia won't give up Crimea to be a DMZ. It's of vital importance to their navy having that port at Sebastopol.
