Right, so we were the one’s doing an unjustified invasion and occupation in 2001 and now we’re helping defend a nation from unjustified invasion, doing the literal 180 opposite thing. We’re also not at war, for the record, we’re supplying lend-lease aid to a reliable allied nation which is completely different from actually sending our own forces in to occupy a country. Not to mention that even though both invasions were unjustified, Ukraine is a country which is a hell of a lot more worth defending than Afghanistan was.
For no reason you think Ukraine is worth it but Afghanistan wasn't, are you sure you just didn't get swept up in the media storm?
We had no good reason to invade Afghanistan russias got no good reason to invade Ukraine. Moral reasons are not good justification to go to war because if you looked around you'd find we would have to go to war with a lot of people.
There is no lend lease, we are giving them out tax dollars cause fuck Russia.which is a confusing message because the US government recognizes why citizens would need to be armed in the Ukraine, while restricting weapons at home.
US isn't in Ukraine and the "$" (which is really mostly weapons and not money but whatever) is so that the US doesn't have to fight Russia in the future because Ukraine is fighting them now.
How naïve do you have to be to believe that if Russian succeeds in Ukraine, they will stop there and US won't have to spend any more money? Deploying troops and missile defense systems to Poland, or even basing nuclear weapons in Finland or Sweden as part of security guarantee isn't cheap.
