I bet none of the people advocating for protests will actually go themselves. I think the people that like the war are more cowardly than those that protested it and there were not a massive amount of those.
If this is a true retreat, and the vote is still out on that one, it's probably the same reason, Russia think they need the forces elsewhere to either hold or attack. Regardless of reason it would be a huge victory for the people of Kherson who have been facing the catastrophy known as urban fighting.
I think it's only a bloody urban battle if there are Russian troops left behind in Kherson which may not be the case.
It will be so exciting to see Ukrainian forces enter a liberated Kherson city, though I shudder to think about what they might find when they get there.
Don't believe the withdrawal too much yet, not until Ukrainian troops enter the city and liberate it. It could be some sort of attempt at deception. Like Ukraine did to Russia by claiming to attack Kherson when they actually advanced in Kharkiv, Russia in its typical fashion might be trying a ruble-store version of something similar.
