Honestly, I'm not sure. WV is kinda unique in how it's public broadcasting/radio works though. Instead of a lot of independent stations, it's a statewide system. It doesn't matter if your in Huntinon, Morgantown, Mullens, or Wheeling we all listen to the same programming and reporting.
Yes, it appears that the WV DHHR was very unhappy with this story and basically used what influence/pull they had to have her pulled out of any future coverage of their office. That in and of itself is pretty hinky. Yes, there may have been some other shenanigans going on. But all part time positions being eliminated =/= retribution.
So, it looks like no one is reading the article (shocking right??). It looks like she didn't get fired because they didn't like her story, the way the AP is reporting it ALL part time reporters were let go.
This could have been a local story forgotten about in a week or two, but they just had to get the reporter fired. Now the whole country knows about it. Really buried that story huh?
