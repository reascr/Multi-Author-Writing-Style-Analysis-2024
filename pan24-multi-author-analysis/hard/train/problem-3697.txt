Unfortunately they don't seem to be required to learn anything, or even be qualified for the job, to get elected. Our leaders need to be held to higher standards. And younger people don't vote as much as older folks, at least half of whom are tech challenged and don't appreciate that our leaders should understand this stuff.
Mr. Beyer sees what's coming. AI will revolutionize every industry and nearly every facet of our lives in the coming years. Every member of Congress should be educating themselves to better understand the ramifications on ethics and privacy. As Mr. Beyer put it.
This will be one of the most important and tricky issues Congress has ever faced, and the capitalist machine will try to stop any potential regulation. Hopefully people like Beyer can guide our lawmakers through it, because as you said, most of them seem technologically challenged.
If only all congressional representatives were this willing to learn new ideas and information. I wish this was common enough not to be newsworthy. Maybe he can set an example.
