Disregarding the views of left of center youth voters hasn’t killed the Democrats yet, so why would it now? You can always just pander like Obama, or to a lesser extent Clinton, and not deliver, and it hasn’t diminished the Democrats’ long term prospects yet. They’ve even abandoned their long term base of support that allowed them to dominate the House for over half a century, the New Deal coalition (which was never incidentally the youth vote) and they’re still around. The Republicans are always going to be worse, so in a real sense the Democrats never have to do anything at all to appeal to the people who recognize them as the better party.
And yes, before the sea of downvotes comes in, the Democratic Party is still far better than the GOP on a host of issues. However, Democrats and Republicans are closer than should be the case when it comes to economic policy.
Student loan forgiveness was a good thing, guess we’ll have to wait for SCOTUS to see if it actually happens.
Not surprising. Neither major party does much for younger voters to earn their votes, and both are led by geriatrics with antiquated views.
This just shows that both Republican and Democratic parties suck and are not attracting new or younger voters. Their stance on popular issues are horrific, there is no reason to keep the status quo with its multitude of social issues.
