The plan was quite simple. It was to trigger a contingent election in congress, where each state gets one vote. They simply wanted to prevent the certification from happening, hoping Pence would simply halt it would have been the easy way, otherwise they moved forward with the bloody way.
Trump wins that "election" in congress. Then it would obviously go to court where (I'm sure this is where Ginni Thomas comes in it was probably pre-arranged) SCOTUS puts a bow of legitimacy on the contingent election and says yes this is all well and good. From there we never again have an election for President.
Oh, but let's say the contingent election happened. Then what? Well funny thing, the states get involved AGAIN and independently vote for who they feel won. This would typically match the popular vote and the previous electoral vote. Just as long as there wasn't a stalemate, the individual states are again the ones deciding. Again, the federal government, no single centralized entity has control over the election.
What you find in this system is that voting and presidential election power is largely burdened down onto the state level, not the federal level. By the time it gets to federal level, it's basically ceremony at that point, not a place you change the results.
The craziest part is their "insurrection" quite literally requires all 50 states to be independently attacked, controlled, and manipulated PLUS federal. That's 51 "insurrections" just to actually influence votes. And these had to be initiated and spread out over time without suspicion or getting caught.
And as for that time she was a prosecutor you know damn well she managed to sneak that into the convo. She loves the smell of her own farts.
