Florian Philippot is fortunately a 100% irrelevant politician as of 2022. He left / was pushed out of the National Front after the 2017 elections and then founded his own party Les Patriotes which advocates leaving the European Union, the Schengen agreements, the European Convention on Human Rights and NATO, and he's become a covid antivaxxer shamelessly spouting fake news and nonsense pandering to conspiracy-minded people from day 1 since the beginning of the pandemic.
Not that the National Rally is any better regarding Russia though: Le Pen and the party have been indirectly funded by Russia since at least April 2014 through a Russian-owned Cypriot bank and then a loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank the same year. Also before the latest Presidential election a former conservative MP Thierry Mariani joined the National Rally and led the 2022 media campaign for Le Pen, and that guy is a notorious Putin and Assad stooge, who's visited Bachar El Assad, Russian-annexed Crimea where he met Putin, and . Le Pen herself said in April that she supported the help to Ukraine but she, Bardella and other high-ranking party members keep opposing financial sanctions on the grounds that it supposedly hurts the French people and economy without affecting Russia.
â€œA far-right French politician, echoing sentiments shared by American counterparts, has criticized France's continuing provision of military aid to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion.
