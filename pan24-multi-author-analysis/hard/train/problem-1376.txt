Right? And alsoâ€¦ how the fuck did we just pass over kid beauty pageants and go straight to drag shows?
Kids beauty pageants are pretty f'd up. It really warps and twist a lot of kids perspective of "beauty" into being a specific look, and if you don't look that way you're considered worthless. It can really screw with a kids self-esteem.
Yep, just so hard to believe conservatives care about kids safety when they constantly turn a blind eye to the crap that happens under their nose. Then again they are probably using the whole drag queen thing so their side keeps ignoring the screams coming from behind the curtain.
Of course it didn't help in the Roman Catholic case that every other major Christian religious organizations were dunking on them. When I was a kid there was a Baptist church down the road that put out flyers around a local Catholic church saying something like "You don't need to worry about our pastor trying to diddle your kids." A couple years later one of their youth pastors was caught SA'ing a kid, and turned out he was a habitual abuser that the church knew about but turned a blind eye to. The local paper and news media barely reported on it.
I have always been highly sceptical of organized religion even as a kid. I remember asking my mom one time why we bothered going to church to listen to someone else tell us how we need to interpret the Bible in front of the preacher. Never went back to that church.
