I'm not saying Sweden is more important geoplitically. I'm saying we like Sweden more, we trust sweden more, and if the reason they aren't let into Nato is because some asshole swede burnt a book and Erdogan got pissy then I think a lot of people are going to be very, very angry with Turkey.
I don't think turkish people quite understand the level of dislike the rest of us allies have for their elected president and his childish whims. They need to elect someone rational because I swear to god, we want Sweden in NATO about 1000 times more than we want Turkey in Nato.
But you're absolutely right that the average Redditor seemingly has no idea just how valuable Turkey is to NATO. The region has been the crossroads of the world for millenia for a reason, or should I say many reasons.
Sweden joining is almost entirely about Gotland, a strategically valuable island in the Baltic Sea. If Russia was going to attack Sweden it would be over Gotland. Also it's about general solidarity with the West but they do have reason to consider some of their land claims vulnerable to Russian attack.
