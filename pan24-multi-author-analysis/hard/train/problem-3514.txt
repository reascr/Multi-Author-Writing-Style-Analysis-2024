The idea is that the bill doesn’t force state to license gay marriage, but rather forces them to recognize other states’ licensure.
Considering "expressly" would mean that the law literally says "state's can take away the civil rights of same-sex partners", no, it doesn't.
I know what you're getting at, that by saying "state's don't need to issue same-sex marriage licenses" that the bill is implicitly allowing states to pick and chose who to apply civil rights to.
It's a start, I would say majority of couples know someone who can drive them to state lines where it's recognized and get someone ordained in that state to marry.
You’re basically guaranteed the ability to have a recognized marriage as long as you’re able to travel to a protected state and get married there. However, not all lgbtq individuals have the resources or income to get married in another state. While I’m lucky to live in a blue state, it is really heartbreaking to think about the hundred of thousands if not millions of lgbtq+ individuals that won’t be able to get married in their home state and will have to spend even more time and resources to receive the same protection as straight, cis-gender Americans.
That definitely is an important point but I still feel that like much of our country’s legislation it disproportionately affects lower income lgbtq+ individuals.
