Mr. BoneSaw here is not the head of state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, That belongs to his father King Salman. He is the Crown Prince, and the Head of Government as the prime minister.
The PM is head of government, not head of state. However, both the head of state and head of government have diplomatic immunity. Below are some other examples of heads of states and government, everyone listed below has diplomatic immunity while in foreign nations.
In similar fashion, the Vice President of the United States (first in line to be head of state…and government…in the event of the President’s death) also has diplomatic immunity. They are neither the head of state nor the head of government, but they still have diplomatic immunity.
Head of State immunity applies in both criminal and civil cases. Biden didn't make it up and didn't pass the laws or create the judicial precedent that creates that immunity.
MBS wasn't a head of state during Biden's campaign and therefore had no immunity at the time. MBS was appointed Prime Minister in 2022 which then made him head of state which has the international privilege of immunity to legal action.
MBS has immunity for two reasons: he is the head of government & he is the Crown Prince. Even if he were not PM, he would still have diplomatic immunity as Crown Prince, just like Prince William of the UK also has immunity.
