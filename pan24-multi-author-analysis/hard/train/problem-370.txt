"I wouldn't do that because I want to bring our country forward," he said on the Hugh Hewitt radio program. "I would be entitled to a revenge tour, if you want to know the truth, but I wouldn't do that. I would want to strenhen our border, get inflation down, build our economy up.".
Yeah, given everything else he lied about, I highly doubt he would actually stick to this "no revenge tour", hell just saying he is "entitled" to one. Sigh, if somehow he actually wins, then I, I give up, because it's clear he will only focus on this and more crimes to get whatever he wants, even as more crises emerge and expand here and across the globe.
Trump's comments come as the race for the 2024 Republican nomination has yet to move into full swing. At least 17 Republicans are considering a run, though former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is the only other person besides Trump who has made it clear she'll enter the race.
The former president spoke with Hewitt for over 30 minutes on Thursday, and the conservative host asked him whether he planned to seek revenge against his opponents if reelected. In 2022, Axios reported that Trump planned to overhaul the federal government to more easily oust disloyal career employees, whom he often refers to as the "deep state.".
Yes. And any article starting with "Trump says" needs to be starved of attention. The real story is that a staggering number of people in positions of trust and power have known who and what trump is for years and are ok with letting him attempt to break America.
