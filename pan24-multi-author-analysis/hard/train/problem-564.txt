Shortly after the Trayvon Martin case made national news, I was stuck in traffic on I-70 and was flipping through the AM bands in my car. There was some batshit right-wing talk show on taking callers who were all saying how great Zimmerman was and using terms like “black youth.” Saying it was the exact right outcome and shit.
How do you draw a line between people speaking their minds and allowing hate to be spread? The people I heard that day weren’t throwing n words around or anything, but their point was pretty clear; it was also clear these folks knew how to word their points, they were probably regular callers who had some grasp of the medium.
Random story, my family used to have some (junk) land in the southern part of my state. I’d go down there on occasion to help clear brush or whatever and see the old landmarks from where I grew up [slowly being torn down and going out of business.].
Yeah. But should posting a racist meme be illegal? How racist should this meme be before the person should face jail time? What about everyone posting racist memes in r/terribleFacebookmemes ? Should they be jailed? Should Reddit shutdown because that sub exists? Should the CEO of Reddit be in jail because that sub exists?
