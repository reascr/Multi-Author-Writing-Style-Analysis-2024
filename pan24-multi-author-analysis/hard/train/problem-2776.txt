Russia shoots missiles over Belarus at Ukraine, Ukraine anti air shoots to intercept than Belarus possibly intercepts calls it an attack, sends mass troops to reinforce border before crossing.
Belarus is in no position to complain when Ukraine missiles land in Belarus as long as Belarus allow Russia to use Belarus as a base to send drones andcmissiles into Ukraine and invade Ukraine. Ukraine should be able to attack any Russian Military in Belarus.
Ukraine has said it will attack russian positions in Belarus. They like to fly Mig-31s to set of air raid alarms in Kyiv and we have every right to shoot at them across the border as they have been shooting missiles and drones from Belarus.
Theres a reason the smart people in charge wont provide Ukraine with planes and missiles that can reach into Russia and why we havent put our troops on the ground or enforced a no fly zone. We know they're a danger and are trying not to provoke them into attacking NATO.
They can also harm us in other ways too, if they did blow up nordstream they could easily do the same to Norways pipeline and screw over Europe. They also have bio and chem weapons like Anthrax, Smallpox and Novichok (they didnt mind using this on NATO soil).
I'm so sick of people downplaying their nukes, just 10% of them functioning can kill millions of people.
