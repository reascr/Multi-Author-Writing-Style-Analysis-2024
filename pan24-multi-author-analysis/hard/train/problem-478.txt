At the start of the war some russian pundits were saying they should "station" troops in Finland too. Some Finnish smartass on twitter said "But there are already 160,000 Russian troops in Finland.".
Yes, quite frankly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine justifiably makes Finland nervous, whatever reason one believes motivated the former, because largely it applies to Finland as well. For example:
But you don't need a functioning army to try, in what as you put it as a "sour grapes" response, and what I'd describe as an unsuccessful attempt. Russia may not be a threat to Finland the state, but certainly can be a threat to Finnish civilians. Depending on one's definition, that is a threat to Finland as well.
Weird, it's almost as if the sole threat to Finland, is the threat a NATO-member offers to Russia. Gosh, that sounds a lot like...geopolitical self-defense from Russia.
The Russian Army has none of those things. It's literally falling apart. So, if a Russian invasion isn't a threat to Finland there's no need for them to join NATO.
Do YOU know anything about current events, or that Finland wasn't actively threatened by Russia, pre-Ukraine invasion? I'll sit and wait, while you supply those sources detailing all the threats Russia imposed upon Finland, c1990-2013.
Finland has been actively arming itself against its Russian neighbor for awhile. And the most you have to present as evidence is the same thing NATO does to Russia.
Speaking of threats and pushing troops close to a country's border, NATO has been an active threat to Russia since well before Putin got there. And your solution is to threaten Russia MORE?? Gee...now what could possibly go wrong?
