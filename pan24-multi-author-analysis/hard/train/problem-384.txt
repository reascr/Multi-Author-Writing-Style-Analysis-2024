At this point, it's not even about the person. The Freedom Caucus just wants to make a show of force like they did in overthrowing Boehner and denying McCarthy the Speakership in 2015, even if they don't have an endgame. And this is why Boehner called Jim Jordan a legislative terrorist (although Jordan isn't part of the drama this time). McCarthy is just unlucky enough to be a victim twice.
The other five seem to just be personally against McCarthy. Good hates him because McCarthy didn't call him right after he ousted Riggleman in the primary. Norman hates him because McCarthy wasn't a fan of Norman's proposed campaign agenda. Biggs is running himself. Not sure what Rosendale's beef is, but I've seen speculation that it is early posturing for a Senate run. And I'm assuming Gaetz just likes the attention and chaos. Tough to see any of them agreeing to any concessions.
This may be part of the reason they're pushing for all these concessions now and allowing him to take it. A feckless idiot can be turned into a figurehead.
It doesn't help that McCarthy is a spineless blowhard more interested in acquiring a new job title than amassing power. He's ensured that he'll be nothing more than a paper tiger, a puppet for whoever manages to actually come out on top within the House of Representatives.
I doubt they would join the Democrats given the current atmosphere. Much more likely that they either plan for retirement or believe they can win their seat as an independent. Voting for a Democratic Speaker would end them as Republicans. The consequences would be.
