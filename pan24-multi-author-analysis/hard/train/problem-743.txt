There was a whole lot of talk of giving Putin an out for like six months and he refused every chance to walk away. After a certain point uou just have to accept the situation is what it is and that Putin won't back out under any circumstances.
If those talks are being hard AFTER Russian troops return to Russia, that’s bout “negotiations” anymore. That’s just the loser begging their new overlords. That’s never gonna happen. That is wholly nonsensical. If that’s your steering point, then just say you’re not negotiating. That’s the part that is stupid.

The US, as before, does not recognise the new territories in the Russian Federation, and of course this significantly complicates the search for solid ground for mutual discussion.".
Yeah. I'm certainly no fan of Putin, but if this could save countless lives as well as a future for the Russian people, I would be for it.
