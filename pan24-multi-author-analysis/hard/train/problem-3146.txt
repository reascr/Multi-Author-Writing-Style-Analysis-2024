Yes, but then that might make Turkey an even less willing participating in NATO and given its strategic location, that would be an issue. This isn't like say Slovenia or Luxembourg trying to play hardball.
\ Of course given it's location, it benefits substantially from being in NATO as well, and unlikely to do so much as to leave or get kicked out.
Yea, that's great, but individual defensive pacts will never be as potent as NATO, with all the countries involved. Additionaly, the agreement between Sweden and the US won't necessarily have the same requirements/agreements as NATO has. My understanding is that it's not a "bilateral defensive pact" a la article 5 "if they attack you we'll join in", but a "defensive cooperation agreement", which implies "military aid" of the "we'll sell you weapons" variety and security cooperation, rather than boots-on-the-ground "military support" a la NATO Article 5, which is where NATO's power comes from.
That's not really realistic. It sucks to give him anything, but he can literally unilaterally keep Sweden from joining. He'll more than likely be given major concessions to approve Sweden's accession, as Sweden joining would be a major boost to NATO and a further bulwark against Russia.
True, but that's not really what the discussion here is about. Additionaly, other defensive pacts will never be as potent as NATO, especially not when the US is not involved.
Sweden and Finland would also be useful both for their strategic location but also both militaries would add real military strenh to the alliance. And let’s be real, they’ll be much more cooperative than Turkey will ever be. Truth be told, if we had to choose one or the other, Finland and Sweden (especially together) are MORE valuable to NATO than Turkey. Sweden should draw a line and demand Turkey honor their side of the agreement. Then the US President should remind Turkey if they veto Sweden and Finland then the US will have them ejected from NATO.
