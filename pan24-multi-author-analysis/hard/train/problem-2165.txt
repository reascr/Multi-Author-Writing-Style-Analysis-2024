"Wolf warrior diplomacy." The term was coined from the Chinese action film Wolf Warrior 2. This approach is in contrast to the prior Chinese diplomatic practices of Deng Xiaoping, which had emphasized the use of cooperative rhetoric and the avoidance of controversy.
You're right! Wolf warrior diplomacy is also extremely off putting to foreign governments, and people. It definitely doesn't promote unity between countries. Idk if you've seen any of these "wolf warrior" tweets, but they are basically weaponized, aggressive narcissists.
Wolf warrior diplomacy is confrontational and combative, with its proponents loudly denouncing any perceived criticism of the Chinese government, its ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and associated policies on social media and in interviews, as well as using physical violence against protestors and dissidents.
>As an attempt to gain "discourse power" in international politics, wolf warrior diplomacy forms one part of a new foreign policy strategy called Xi Jinping's "Major Country Diplomacy" (Chinese: Â§ßÂõΩÂ§ñ‰∫§; pinyin: D√†gu√≥ W√†ijiƒÅo) which has legitimized a more active role for China on the world stage, including engaging in an open ideological struggle with the Western world.
Because, insofar as this article and wikipedia, the Chinese don't seem call it that domestically, at least not officially. It's a descriptor of their "Major Country Policy". It's seems to be a Tongue-in-cheek expression. The guy that started with the agressive comments once called a wolf warrior which is not good.
This is the man they‚Äôre trying to use as symbol for a ‚Äúwolf warrior‚Äù. First of all what the hell is even that and second why it look like this guy bout to fall over after two punches to the chin?? Lol talk about wrong casting choices ü§£.
