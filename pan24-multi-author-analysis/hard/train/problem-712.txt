I think the point is that the black population in South Carolina is more spread out. In the states you mentioned almost all the blacks are either in Detroit, Pittsburgh, or Philadelphia. While in South Carolina you've got 11 counties with black populations of 40k or more.
South Carolina represents the American south, which has the largest concentration of black voters. Remember, if not for Jim clyburn, the most powerful democrat in South Carolina, endorsing Biden, Biden would’ve lost that state and would’ve most likely dropped off out of the race. Instead, thanks to clyburn a endorsement, Biden won South Carolina and went on to sweep the south.
He chose South Carolina because it was a turning point for him in the 2020 primaries. If Jim clyburn, the most powerful democrat in South Carolina, didn’t endorse him, he probably would’ve lost South Carolina and his presidential aspirations would’ve likely been over.
Democrats used to win Iowa in the presidential elections and used to dominate in New Hampshire. Now, due to the working class feeling like democrats have abandoned them, democrats aren’t even competitive in Iowa and barely squeak by in New Hampshire.
Then you would think biden would want to start the primaries in New York or another big state. As the incumbent president of the United States, he has a war chest that’s massive amount to flood the airways in New York. He’s also relatively popular in New York as Kathy Hochul was one of the few politicians to allow Biden to campaign for her during the midterms.
