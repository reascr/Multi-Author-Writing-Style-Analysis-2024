Didn't expect anything less of Sweden. However, if they send personal to these regions they hopefully wear their flag on clothing or something. The Turkish people get a lot of bad narrative fed through Erdogan and Sweden should signal, that they are a good partner to have.
As a Swede I have have not seen the best of Erdogan and his regime lately, and have been resentful of the Turkish diplomacy towards us. But that does not take away my empathy and sympathy for the Turkish people and I am sure many Swedes feel the same.
I know the relations between our countries have not been the best lately, but let's put the whole NATO-thing aside for a moment. If we can help with the rescue work and relief after these frightening earthquakes I am confident we are eager to do so.
Yeah, that sounds infuriating. And so scary. In a disaster like this you expect the response to be swift and decisive. I wish the best to the whole region and all the rescue workers in their work with limited resources.
I hope the international aid is swift as well and it gladdens me to see many countries answer quickly. Even countries with frosty relations to TÃ¼rkiye. It's a reminder that our differences do not outweigh our will to help fellow people in need.
