It's a bit late for China to claim taking offense to something for political exploitation is unbecoming of a sovereign nation. If that's the consensus they want to reach, then China got China'd by the United States.
Rather than USA through actions and words treat China as an equal competitor USA is cheating to keep China from further improving their own country. Says China.
Tech57...But do tell me where your knowledge on China stems from. Not kidding you...just being curious is all as I don't necessarily disagree with all of your comments.
Common sense if very important and I don’t mind if people have different opinions. It’s the “strongly held beliefs” that don’t seek to understand. If their opinion is different I’m curious what I missed. In the USA there is a big push to replace Russia or the War On Terrorism with China as The New Bogeyman. Lots of people make fun of China. I don’t agree with that and my opinion is it’s not good but I’m open to have people explain why I should spend every day hating on China when “our planet really is on the brink in many ways, requiring concerted efforts to tackle all those problems.”.
