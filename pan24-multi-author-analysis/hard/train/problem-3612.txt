Or maybe move her out of the prison into the criminal ward of a hospital (the same spot people in critical condition due to attacks or other health issues) to await the berth? So that the complications can be handled? Are you really justifying the behaviour? The only reason possible for keeping a pregnant woman about to pop in a prison cell is “she sinned and now she can pay the price.” As someone told you earlier, no non-religious person would have any basis in thinking other than making sure she was near the care she needed when she needed it.
If they are worried about people hiding or being missed when going into labour in prison, that speaks to a problem that is clearly not with the pregnant inmate.
Also, immediate care of a sick neonate is really something that should not be done outside of a suitable environment. If the prison authority wants to reduce uncertainty, why not let the mothers-to-be have a, y’know, normal human conversation about options for induction/Caesarian _after they are moved to a labour ward_?
I ask this as someone who was faced with having to potentially resuscitate a sick baby on a baby-change mat, placed on a desk, inside a patently unsuitable room in a psychiatric hospital. Having been told I might be sprinting 200 yards with a kitbag from the SCBU when I got the call she was dropping. This situation was different in that the lady was psychotic but had a midwife with her, and _did not consent_ despite understanding our detailed explanation of the risks, or you bet we would have taken her straight to labour ward. Even in these extreme cases, consent and autonomy have to be respected even if it seems mad to a reasonable person and makes our professional decisions harder.
