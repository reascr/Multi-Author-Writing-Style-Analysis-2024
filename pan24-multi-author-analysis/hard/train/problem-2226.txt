It's like some intern just scribbles it into a notebook that gets thrown away. Given our military budget the fact sensitive documents aren't tracked is blasphemous. I really doubt you can just photo copy some of Lockheed's current design plans and just walk out so why the hell is this possible?
Exactly. Nothing nefarious imo but NARA should have known and requested back in whatever the "checkout" time was. I mean it's just simple library rules here.. or so i thought. The fact this stuff is missing for years is just nuts. And goes to show how trump took all he wanted.
Would be an interesting trick given Trump has personally claimed them and demands them back. More poorly thought out false equivalence my friend.
That is what the investigation is for to find out whatever hole caused it and improve the process. Misplaced documents like this happen after every admin practically. The proper process here was followed and I am extremely doubtful any crime occurred let alone one Biden is culpable for.
Going purely on the public information (which is the only thing we really can go off of) though, it looks like Biden's case was accidental. It definitely should be looked into and might result in some staffer being let go, but it doesn't seem intentional like the Trump case was.
The bigger issue that I'd like to see investigated is how the National Archives didn't know that these documents were missing for 6 years. If classified documents can be misplaced (or taken) and nobody realizes for years then what classified information was leaked and what damage has it done?
Exactly. If there was any intentional taking/keeping of classified documents in the Biden case then anyone responsible should face appropriate consequences.
