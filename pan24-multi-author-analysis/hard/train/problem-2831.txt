There are pictures of that girl filming the IDF soldiers. Just shows you that like others said - "witnesses" can lie.
So Israel can't rely on the PA. What other option do they have to keep their citizens safe? And saying BS like "ThEy cOuLd Go AwAy" doesn't help and isn't realistic at all, without the fact that it's not as simple as that to think of Israel as the invaders - it's much more complicated than that, and anyone who tries to paint it as something less than 5 full paragraphs is a complete moron.
The problem with this line of thinking is that according to the Palestinians, the entire land is invaded, therefore the only solution would be for Israel to destruct itself, something which Israel obviously isn't going to do.
At what point does Israel consider that the consequences of their continued, brutal occupation of a region is not worth the damage to their international reputation?
The geopolitical reality, whether you like it or not, is that advocating for a carte blanche Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank is asking for thousands of dead on both sides, and asking for the conflict to yet again erupt into something more akin to a regional war than a military occupation with intermittent flair-ups.
