"There is a real risk of losing the sovereignty of the Amazon not to any other country, but to organized crime," he said in an interview.
BRASILIA, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Brazil runs the risk of losing control over its vast Amazon rainforest region to organized crime and traffickers who use the lawless region to smuggle drugs, a Supreme Court judge warned on Wednesday.
Justice Luis Roberto Barroso proposed that environmental experts, investors and local authorities come together to brainstorm on how to foster sustainable development that would preserve the Amazon rainforest, the world's largest, and help the livelihood of the 25 million people who live there.
Barroso, who attended COP27 United Nations climate talks in Egypt in November, proposed that Brazil gather "the best minds in the world" to discuss how to develop a "bioeconomy" for the Amazon to stop the degradation of the region.
