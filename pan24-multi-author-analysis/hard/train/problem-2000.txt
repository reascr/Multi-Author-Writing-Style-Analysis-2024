Kazakhstan was where the USSR tested most of its nukes. If Kazakhstan was suicidal enough to try to invade Russia, with how easily they jump to the most extreme options, they might not have many qualms about returning to “life fire tests” of nukes there.
Plus, Kazakhstan has no reason to try to invade Russia; they don’t want Russian territory, much less at the cost of hundreds of thousands of their civilians’ lives and millions displaced.
Then i would not really care because Russia has for decades been telling them how they should run their country and it would likely mean Russia would have to forsake their war against Ukraine in order to defend their own country.
In reality i am somewhat split over it because i also do not want to trigger nukes but seeing as Russia has been saber rattling nukes for a solid year i am kind of worn down on that crap.
Hey if i am wrong i gotta stand up and take it by bending over deeply (pun intended) and smiling. Thing are best taken with a smile and a laugh. I will look back at this exact conversation next time i have to spell it.
