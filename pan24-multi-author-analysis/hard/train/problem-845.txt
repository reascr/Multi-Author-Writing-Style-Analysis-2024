Ask people to give you more rights and it seems reasonable enough. Ask people to dismantle the power structure that keeps them in power and they will view it as an attack on everything they care about. They will fight with everything they have, because that's what they see you as trying to take from them so they've got nothing to lose.

You seem to be under the impression that incremental progression is possible in a place like iran. These people are literally arresting, killing, and blackmailing people and their families just for speaking out against a head scarf. a good start is sending the theocracy out of the country, like they did to the shah 40 years ago, anything else is a half measure that will be met with the same kind of brutality you see in russia and china. to protest for incremental change is to put a target on your head for both yourself and your entire family, these people only understand the language of violence.
