It’s funny, when you said “it’s full of trucks”, I wonder if all of this is a PR campaign to make Tesla semi’s an easier pill to swallow for EV hating conservatives?
I still love driving the car but yeah, quality is crap and having the CEO go full fascist MAGA means the next EV isn't going to be a Tesla.
Musk's love affair with MAGA morons is going to fuck him over. He's not going to be able to afford apartheid Twitter by pissing of his Tesla customer base and I don't see MAGA conservative buying his cybertruck and Tesla branded truck nuts anytime soon.
He needs to return the public money he took from government handouts but other than that he can keep whatever is left after the collapse of Tesla (and the inevitable fall of everything else that the Ponzi is propping up) and then he can fuck off.
Musk has always been a homunculus-brained moron but it's now been clear for a while that he's actually dumb enough to be a problem for the functioning of democracy around the world.
Given that his narcissism exceeds his intelligence he is a target for manipulation - the consequences of which may be catastrophic.
