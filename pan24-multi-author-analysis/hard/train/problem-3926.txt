People volunteer to be the guinea pigs for cancer drugs. Drugs that have successfully cured cancer in animals and have been approved for human trials. But guess what? 93% of cancer drugs approved for Phase 1 Human trials FAIL. If you're a mouse or a monkey, scientists can cure your cancer no problem. But those miracle drugs don't do shit for humans.
And that ninety-five percent of all drugs and products that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials?
B) Not test them on animals but run the risk of having your product line suddenly pulled and then have to test them anyway.
In the case of animal testing, if you don't like it, then stop buying things from companies and corporations who use animal testing.
However, with other big markets banning animal testing (The EU and California), more companies are going with stopping animal testing since the markets that ban animal testing are starting to out-weigh the markets that require it.
Beyond trade secrets, knowing this Canadian provision, what manufacturer will proclaim their products (for export to Canada) are animal tested?
China removing their requirements on foreign cosmetics to be tested on animals isn't completely true.
