2. Greatly increased quality of aid to Ukraine (modern tech, even more HIMARs, possibly 4th generation planes and ATACMs).
1. Greatly increased quantity of aid to Ukraine (so much more artillery, clothing, NATO-standard small arms).
There will be a proportionate reaction. This was a predictable scenario and responses have certainly been prepared in advance. A few possibilities:
4. Peacekeepers along the northern border to completely neutralise the threat to Kyiv and allow Ukrainian forces there to reposition.
3. No-fly zone over some or all of Ukraine - would be completely understandable now that we know missiles could hit Poland.
100 or so km zone along the NATO border with Ukraine hardly invades Russian airspace. It should be enough buffer to intercept anything possibly hitting NATO territory (and cover Lviv and other border regions by a happy accident).
After this incident, they can claim a buffer zone inside Ukraine around the borders with Poland and other NATO countries where anything dangerous gets shot down.
