My thinking is that if the EU has to back down from the price cap due to the effects on their economy, Russia can dictate terms on restarting the oil deal, which I would assume would cover the fines from the breaches of contracts and other compensation. It comes down to who blinks first. Also, OPEC could also tighten the supply even more.
also, I did not know about the oil industry and the effects of stopping the oil drilling. thanks for the info .
if Russia stops production completely and takes all their oil off the global market, it would cause the oil price to jump drastically. If India pays 'normal' prices now (say, 80 dollars), it would be cheaper than the elevated prices with messed up supplies (maybe 150+ dollars).
India is still going to buy it all, even if it's "normal" price because others will charge more due to increased demand.
India gains nothing long term, but if they'd take the short term lose we'd all be better off in the long run.
From a "whatever is good for India" perspective, India needs to realize that they have Russia by the short and curlies. They should stop buying for a month and then see how much lower they can get the price.
But, they wont do that b/c going by their choices over the last year Modi has the forward-thinking capability of a goldfish.
