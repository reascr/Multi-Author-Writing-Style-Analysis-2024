The people protesting the northern Ireland protocols are Unionists. Meaning they support Northern Ireland remaining part of the UK, and oppose (historically violently) the idea of Irish reunification even at the end of a referendum.
Note that NI as a whole voted against Brexit, but these radical Unionists were for - because they expected it to hurt Ireland more than them.
This is a part of the reason why Northern Ireland overwhelmingly voted against Brexit. They knew that a hard border on the island of Ireland would lead to sectarian violence & terrorism (again).
There used to be a long civil war in NI between people wanting to be part of Ireland and people wanting to be part of the UK.
The British filled NI with many non Irish over the centuries that it's no longer a majority Irish so I don't see them ever getting back together with ROI.
It's because northern Ireland had a much more extensive settler system than the rest of Ireland under British rule. Meaning a much larger percentage of residents are descent from Scottish and English Settlers rather than Irish. That combined with the industrialization of the North that drove more internal UK immigration into the region and the historical rampant sectarianism between the mostly Protestant settlers and converted Irish and the mostly Catholic Irish means the Unionists historically don't trust Irish to treat them fairly in a country where they would have an absolute super majority over the Protestant and settler descent communities.
