If you want to avert a strike why not give the workers what they want? Rail companies make billions and are the backbone of the US economy, I'm sure they could manage a bit more pay or a benefit program or something...
Or you know the billionaire owners of the rail companies could give them the cost of living pay raise they are asking for as well as the small amount of PTO they want and hire an few more people. The union really isn’t asking for a lot at all their demands are very reasonable. They will still be making billions and billions a year in profit no problem.
These slavedrivers made 20 billion in profit last year. If they can’t figure out how to run a railroad without slavery, nationalize the railroads.
Congress can just as easily force the rail carriers to give the workers humane schedules instead of these abusive 24/7/365 schedules.
Everybody is accepting this false narrative that the rail workers sacrificing again is the only choice. It’s a lie.
If that’s the case, it’s fucking bullshit. Shut the shit down and mail RR companies to the wall for it. You want to give rural voters someone to vote for? Then champion our middle class like you said you would.
It’s true. When profits are separate from productivity, the middle class worker is the first to hit the chopping block. Stock buy backs are a matter of national security, as our economy should not be built on a house of cards.
This is coming from a pretty hard line progressive who wants to see unions and middle class workers get some much needed support from our gov’t.
