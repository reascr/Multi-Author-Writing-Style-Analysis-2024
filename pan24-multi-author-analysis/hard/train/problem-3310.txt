She still denies that anyone here could imagine someone flying planes into buildings, despite the many Pentagon led exercises covering that exact scenario.
I will offer u proof ,which u can see 4 yourself. View any video of the 2nd impact. Note the cylinder under the fuselage. No commercial jets Ever Have This. Now watch in slo mo as the object hits a steel frame building, with no damage to it. Hollow aluminum wings pass thru steel girders intact ,neither bending or disintegrating in pieces. Just b4 impact note the flash of light. Finally follow the object as it "disappears/dissolves" into a solid building with No damage and not one piece of airplane debris falling into the street. See the video shot from the street and nothing comes off the object upon impact. According to experienced pilots who have actually flown the jets claimed to be involved on 9/11 no commercial jet could execute any of the maneuvers seen or described at sea level at 500+ mph without breaking apart. Only military jets can.
Very true, they are almost as bad as the US with it's 800+ military bases, over 80 armed conflicts going on currently, a military budget that is larger than the next 10 countries totalled, a history of assassinating elected world leaders, causing or actively supporting every armed conflict since ww2, assassinating a sitting American president n his brother, etc. I could go on but you get the idea.
She's a traitor to her country and should have been sent to Guantanamo with the other neocons who perpetrated the 9/11 atrocities.
Sheâ€™s a dire war criminal and should be rotting in chains in The Hague along with the rest of the military junta that really runs the USAs criminal war machine.
