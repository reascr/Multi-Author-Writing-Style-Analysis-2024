Thanks for the link with the chart that supports my point, even though it feels like you posted this as a counter.
There's clearly a lot more alternative energy production now than 20 or 30 years ago (when it was close to none).
Baseline Power: Yep, that what's happening if there is a mix of different forms of energy and no extreme high amount of renewables or nuclear, e.g. germany right now. There is no issue running 3 (or previously 6) nuclear power plants covering 10% when you produce something around 40% by wind and PV.
Okay, so you're saying that the variance of solar/wind is too great to allow nuclear to provide the overwhelming majority of baseline power?
So, what would compliment solar/wind effectively other than coal/oil/gas that we can dial up and down or massive energy storage capacity to even it out? After all, I'm not hearing a problem with nuclear so much as a warning about over-relying on solar/wind.
There can be a need for nuclear when wind and solar is at it's limit but that isn't the case in any country right now.
But if you extend wind and pv (which is happening) you will have more and more days reaching 100%, where you don't need any other power. Let's assume you now make 80% with renewables in average - that probably means that probably half a year you don't need anything else, but for something like two weeks a year you need to cover 100%. This is not something you want to do with a nuclear power plant for technical and economical reasons.
Nuclear power plants can reduce power to 80% load quite easily, newer ones even to 50%ish range. Going below drastically reduces cycle treshhold (can't recall exact numbers, but it was something like from 20.000 to 2000).).
