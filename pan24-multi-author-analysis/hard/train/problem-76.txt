When Ukraine is liberated in full, itl take a decade or more to rebuild with massive western aid. if its anything like Germany post ww2, the population will have no more appetite for war. hell, the Ukrainians didnt even before this war. If there is a country that understands the need for territorial integrity and how the powerful players around the world react to its violation, itl be Ukraine.
with Ukraine hitting ruzzia proper, they already have. if ruzzia goes nuclear, china will be going insane, india and pakistan will fucking flip their shit. even NK would be pissed. u DO NOT break a nuclear taboo, cause then u open the floodgates. while putin might not care, those around and below him want to spend their hard-stolen cash.
where is Ukraine going to expand to? Nuclear NATO it wants to join, or Nuclear Russia that cannot use nukes in Ukraine cause of geopolitics or Russia on its internationally recognized soil should its survival be threatened by a Ukrainian counter invasion?
Option 1: Use tactical nuclear weapon against the Ukrainian military, a country that has no tactical, let alone strategic nuclear weapons of their own, a country that is not part of any collective defense agreement.
