Isn't it quite ironical, so many Grammar Nazis show up, when “Hitlers final solution” is mentioned. But seriously, come on, it is the third language of six I was forced to learn in my lifetime. Give me some slack.
Exactly, I am a shook, that so few Russian, caught on. Like, they must know at some level, that all the things they accuse Ukrainians and West of, are happening in Russia.
Pretty weird to state that when Putin's own words during the televised part when he declared war on Ukraine was saying he is going to solve "The Ukrainian Question".
>Using Ukraine as a proxy, he said, "they we are waging war against our their country with the same task: the 'final solution' of the Russian Ukrainian question".
This is actually a comparison for the Russian war in Ukraine. Democracy in Ukraine is destabilizing to the Russian regime. Ukraine flexing their sovereignty is a threat to there military bases and control of the black sea. Just like the US fights the regimes in Iraq/libya/Nicaragua/serbia/etc to maintain their power and vision, Russia wants to do the same with ukraine/syria/georgia/etc.
The US post cold war conflicts have been mostly pursued in attempt to stabilize their world vision. Open trade, capitalism and non conflict (or at least conflict only done on their terms.). The post cold war conflicts have been against destabilizing regimes and authoritarian leaders who go against the globalized economy that the US is trying to maintain.
