I agree, also “Ted” Cruz’s real name is Rafael Edward Cruz and “Mitch” McConnell’s real name is Addison Mitchell McConnell. Nothing wrong with either first name, but you KNOW that GOP base voters will denigrate both—racist and sexist, respectively, if I had to guess.
You can be sexist and still prefer a female candidate if you think she’s the best person to take away women’s rights and punish women more severely than the other guy.
Eh nothing special she flip flops way too much the only thing I’d like about her winning would be to piss off the left in the fact that the first female president isn’t a democrat.
Hell, I'd wager even a lot of the GOP party leadership, when push really comes to shove, aren't gonna have the balls to turn their backs on him like that - however sick of him politically as they might be. I think A LOT of people are really underestimating the psychological hold Trump still holds over the party base. His image is still more powerful than that of any other politician in the party (including DeSantis).
The "evil and racist, but still mildly sane" contingent of conservatives believes what you just said. But they're not the full lot.
