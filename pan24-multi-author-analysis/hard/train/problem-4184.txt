People just want to continue living their same exact lifestyle, but with different words attached to the same thing. In reality, the changes we need to make probably wouldn't leave us with something that resembles the modern, comfy lifestyle and may even require population shrink (Imagine telling people that they can't have as many kids as they might want? Good luck on that one.) No one wants to sell this to you because they already know you won't buy it and no politician wants to promise it to you because they know you won't vote for them on it.
We can blame politicians and billionaires and whatever else makes you numb and apathetic, but it matters not because we are all responsible and we will all suffer the same fate which is extinction and it may come a lot sooner than you think.
I'm also worried people will misinterpret what you said as "Politicians and corporations need to fix the problems they created" with out understanding politicians will never do that unless we incentivize or outright force them to.
At this point, when it's clear corporations and governments aren't going to do what's needed to be done, the responsibility is on as as individuals to act as a collective to force their hand. It's really that simple. If we're unwilling or unable to do that we're fucked.
Doing those things while corporations and governments still fuck the planet is like one less stab wound on a decapitated corpse.
There are billions of people who never gave a shit in the first place and they're the problem as much as the corporations and governments.
We really should have been holding these companies polluting like crazy responsible instead of giving these horrible people more and more of our money.
