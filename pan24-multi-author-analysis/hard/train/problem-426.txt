If anything, since they celebrate ignorance and criticize knowledge, they likely revel in not knowing that difference between a government shutdown and a debt default. Given their penchant for "expertise based on reading a Facebook post," I'm surprised that they're not opting for having a life saving operation performed by someone who once saw an episode of Grey's Anatomy instead of one of those elitist doctors with their "medical degrees.".
Quite a bit. All spending must originate in the house, so in theory they can leave us with literally no federal budget. Plus the house can refuse to raise the debt ceiling and the global gold standard for safe investments can default - which could be catastrophic for the global ecomonmy.
Democrats won't vote for McCarthy because he is unacceptable to them and he'd betray the ones that voted for him in an instant.
And even if the freedom caucus votes with the Democrats to vacate the chair, there's no chance that whoever is put forward to replace McCarthy would be agreeable between those two groups.
Can someone please explain to me why a few moderate Dems wouldn't vote for McCarthy to prevent him from making concessions to the far right? It seems like MAGA republicans now have an uneven amount of power which was completely avoidable.
