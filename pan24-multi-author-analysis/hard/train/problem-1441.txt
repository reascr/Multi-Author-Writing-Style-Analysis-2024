edit: I know that runoffs and ranked choice are different. But there are enough similarities that make me think they could easily switch to RC without it feeling much different for the vast majority of people. Instead of going back to re-vote when nobody makes it to 50%, you just say your second choice and it'll go from there).
(On that note, is it just me or is Georgia's runoff law basically a longer version of ranked choice?).
I. Cannot. Wait. For. A. Trump. And. Desantis. Debate. It’s going to be off the rails and we will get watch the republicans cannibalize themselves in real time omfg.
The GOP is officially in the midst of their own civil war now and it’s going to be quite beautiful to watch as they tear each other apart and destroy themselves in that process. After these midterms, the GOP was already beginning to feel a bit like a Tarantino film where everyone is pointing their guns at each other. I think some shooting is going to be happening real soon.
I feel Democrats are generally the party of being for all the things which greatly help people and society (versus a GOP of “against-ism”) - but it certainly helps to have a common enemy to hate and for us on the left to become united against that common foe too.
It’s not illegal to “demoralize” your opposition, and frankly, it’s easier to convince right wingers to stay home/vote third party than convince them to vote for a Democrat out of the “goodness” of their hearts.
