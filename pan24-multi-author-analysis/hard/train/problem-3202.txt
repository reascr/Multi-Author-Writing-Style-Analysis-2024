Conservatives, being anti-progress by nature, have chosen to destroy education rather than have a shred of introspection.
The GOP and conservative America as a whole are staunchly anti-education and anti-science. Your possible divergence from this trend is as meaningless as my own.
This should not be difficult for an educated critical thinker to understand. Unless of course, you’re being disingenuous, which is always a possibility.
For example: Most of the educated conservatives I know are socially liberal, but they buy into conservative economics. Of course that begs the question of what evidence there is that the GOP’s take on economics works at all.
Understand that there are exceptions to all rules, but those exceptions do not negate the greater truths. For example, I am a 40-something straight, white male trade school graduate who works at a factory and was raised in an evangelical household in coal country Kentucky. Most people with my background are conservative; I am not. My existence does not affect the overall trend one bit.
