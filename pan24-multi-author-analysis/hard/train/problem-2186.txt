Keep in mind that the GOP doesn't need a popular majority, or a majority of states. They just need majorities in the right kind of places. During the 2020 election, Biden got millions more votes than Trump, but a lot of those are "wasted" votes.
It's counting each individual vote that was cast and tallying them, it's the same logic Dems use to say Biden won the popular vote in 2020.
If the majority of the primary voters pick someone else (and the candidates don't repeat '16 and all run and split the vote) he won't get a choice in the matter.
Splitting the vote was precisely what I was thinking he might do, but by running third party if he doesn't have the backing of the establishment. That alone would be the end of republicans' chances in '24. There are a number of other ways he can sabotage republicans though. For example, if he loses a republican primary, he could spread conspiracy theories and lies about the primary being rigged, which would further divide the republican base and discourage turnout.
Also, the republican party is still all-in on Trump and Trumpism. Just look at what's going on with the House right now. McCarthy sold his soul to MAGA to become the speaker, empowering the right-wing extremists in his party.
