Actually the line that matters is the observation that the Ukrainian abuses were limited to 3 detention sites, while the Russian abuses seemed to be systematic. So Ukraine it's specific individuals responsible at those sites (which should 100% be investigated and prosecuted) while Russia it's the Russian military/government as a whole and seems to be a matter of policy.
While I agree that human rights violations would apply, the point is that they're not soldiers covered by the Geneva Convention. Instead they're, essentially, mass murderers who've been shooting Ukrainians. There should be an investigation/trial, sure, but this isn't comparable to the Nazis rounding up soviet citizens for mass murder. These are people \in\ Ukraine actively killing people.
