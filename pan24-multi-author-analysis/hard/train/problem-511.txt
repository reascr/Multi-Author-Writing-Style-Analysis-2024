Megaraptorids however are not Dromaeosaurs, being closer to either the Allosauroid Neovenator, the ceratosaur Noasaurus, basal Tyrannosaurs (e.g Proceratosaurus) or the base of Coelorosauria (e.g Ornitholestes). It is not yet agreed where Megaraptorids go.
The megaraptorid Australovenator from Australia is regarded to as the dinosaur equivilent of the cheetah. Deltadromeus from Africa, which may be a Megaraptorid (or may be a Noasaur) was even faster.
Megaraptors aren't dromaeosaurs (raptors), (they may have been feathered, but this is unclear). They are a medium sized type of dinosaur with a large sickle claw on their hand (similar to Baryonychine spinosaurs, Noasaurs and Neovenatorids... it appears many dinosaurs had hand claws). The featherd dionsaur being referred to is the Dromaeosaur Unenlagia.
Raptor is informal; the family is largely Dromaeosauridae. Lots in this family are called raptors (in their name), lots aren’t. Raptor itself means “snatching/seizing” and the clade Maniraptor, of which Dromaeosaurids are a part, references the shared feature of their hands/wrist structures.
For dinosaurs, is there a taxonomy-based meaning for "raptor?" (as opposed to things like an allosaurus or a T-rex or other non-raptor names). If not, is there some sort of size limit before it stops being a dinosaur raptor and starts being some other name, or part of the T-Rex family or something?
