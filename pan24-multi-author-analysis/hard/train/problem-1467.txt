Why aren't you investigating George H W Bush, who has been dead for several years, and his bowling alley Chinese restaurant!?
Uh it was though? They were found on Nov 2, handed over to NARA on Nov 3 by the letter of the law (who is the appropriate body to handle them, not the DoJ), NARA informed the DoJ on Nov 4 as they're supposed to. They didn't choose to tell the press until later, but there's literally no evidence Biden's lawyer went through them, and they informed the appropriate body as soon as they possibly could. Nothing ridiculous about it.
I agree, I'm saying we know trump's were criminal, and it's highly unlikely biden's were based on available information and what we know about them as people.
I agree that this isnt something we should just dismiss because it's nowhere near as bad as Trump's case but at the same time, I don't think this sinks Biden politically and certainly not criminally. It's an embarrassment but one they can recover from unless there a massive bombshell still waiting to go off.
