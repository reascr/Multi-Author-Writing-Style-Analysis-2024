At one point, he dinged GOP lawmakers who voted against a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. “To my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry,” he said. “We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.”.
Joe wants to help fix our roads, power grid, railways, etc. He says, “It’s going to cost this much to do all that”. Republicans say boo you’re a democrat and I don’t want you to get any recognition for something successful, I’m not voting for it. Even though that republican’s infrastructure is in shambles and desperately needs it.
Republicans do the republican thing and lie to their constituents about how to why voted for it so the people don’t get upset with them and take the money because the bill ultimately passed.
The difference is republicans don't give a shit about you, they only care about money and power. You and students like you getting loan forgiveness is viewed as a negative in their zero-sum worldview and they just can't have that.
