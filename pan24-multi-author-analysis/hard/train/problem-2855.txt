Thats the irony of it all. Voting in AZ has been pretty easy and things have went well for the most part for a long time. Its so odd people would believe an election denier so easily.
These results were against vehement election deniers as well. If the GOP had even slightly more moderate candidates, the election would have likely had a very different outcomes.
You mean the ones that show a 5 point difference for senate? The ones that have dems with 3/7 house seats? How about the ones showing a 0.8% difference in the governors race? Or did you mean the ones where the Secretary of State was sub 5% difference as well?
I’m out in San Tan, and have been trying to tamper people’s expectations about Az turning blue. It’s a looooong way from that. This state is still very red, but people on both sides are exhausted with rehashing 2020.
The state’s still red af. That’s why AZ is decidedly purple and not blue. There is the AG race yet to be called that would be a huge help. The dem was up last I saw.
