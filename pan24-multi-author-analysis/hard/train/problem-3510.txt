In the end, the Republicans lost after essentially filibustering the bill (via offering amendment after amendment after amendment) for almost 15 hours. Debate began on noon Friday and went until almost 3 AM today, Saturday.
The amendments the Republicans offered - which they claimed were good-faith compromises - really weren't much in the way of compromise at all. The included a 6-week abortion ban (really only 4 weeks after conception) and a 6-week ban with exceptions for rape and incest.
To be fair they had a couple of reasonable amendments in there that got rejected like the ban on selling fetus body parts or adding restrictions on abortions after 39 weeks.
The only people getting “abortions” at 39 weeks are people who are in the most dire medical need, so banning end-term abortion actually just means killing people. No one’s aborting babies that are fully capable of living outside the womb without any intervention.
Are you referring to elective abortions in the 3rd trimester (not a thing) or healthcare for women with babies experiencing traumatic health care issues/complications that make a successful birth impossible?
