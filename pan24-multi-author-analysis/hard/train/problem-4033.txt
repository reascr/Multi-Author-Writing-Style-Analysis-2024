Their first Kyiv rush failed when Ukraine effectively had a barely functioning militia and soviet equipment for the most part.
I can't even imagine what will happen when the now fully trained and largely battle hardened Ukrainian army with NATO equipment retaliates against conscripts with 1 boot between 4 men in winter.
b) If they do invade again the Russian military leaderships probably thinks they can grind down Ukrainian troops just by sheer mass. Like waves grinding down rocks at the beach. It takes countless attempts but they might think they will win just by having the numbers (potentially recruitable manpower that is).
It is very highly unlikely that anything will work. Russia had some success in the north during the beginning of the war because of the surprise moment and Ukrainian lack of equipment and manpower. All of this has changed drastically during the war and I do think they will just get a bloody nose.
Yes, absolutely. We just need to have contingency plans for everything so we don't get surprised by anything with our pants down. Russia using nukes would be national suicide.
If Russians use a nuke thatâ€™s the end for russia. They will be completely isolated from the world and may have a proportionate response against them. Putin wants to threaten the use of nuclear weapons but even he knows better than to actually use one.
The still unthinkable option is for Russia to use tactical nuclear weapons and think it will break Ukrainian morale and lines for them to just swoop in. Let me say that more clearly: this is extremely unlikely but in a war you should not prepare for what is convenient but what is possible.
