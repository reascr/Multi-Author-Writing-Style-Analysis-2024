Ah not quite sadly. Their frigates and subs are actually solid. Russia never really invested money into aircraft carriers like the US did. Different strokes for different folks.
Yeah but that is also the point of MAD. Realistically the only navy with aircraft carriers Russia would ever face off against is a NATO country and realistically any war in Europe would be land based. Russias military was not designed for naval force projection in conventional warfare on the seas or in a bid to launch carrier operations making strikes on the US mainland.
The very minute it’s confirmed that this little frigate starts lobbing missiles aimed directly at the US, will be the same minute it will find itself under attack from a number of different tracking forces, notably lurking subs, ships and jet fighters.
For those worried about this so-called new hypersonic threat, while their speed can pose a challenge: The US Military has already been shooting down real supersonic and hypersonic ballistic missiles in tests and in combat for over 20 years. People forget or don’t know that ICBMs and MRBMs already reach hypersonic speeds (Mach 5+), and have done this for decades.
This frigate is a sad shadow of the large Atlantic and Pacific Fleets with Kirov-class Battlecruisers that the USSR used to field during the Cold War.
Anti-missile tech has come a long way. For example: The latest generation of Patriots has a 98%+ kill rate against pretty much anything it targets, and it does this with hit-to-kill warheads, without proximity explosives like older interceptor missiles use.
