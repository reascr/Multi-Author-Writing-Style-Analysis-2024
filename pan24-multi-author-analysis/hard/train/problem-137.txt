Not only is it possible to stop this crap civilly, it's the only way that we can address this and keep our democracy at the end of the day. If the only way that we can see out of this is political violence, our country is already lost.
Vote. Vote in every election, for every race. Vote no matter the barriers and structural impediments thrown up in your way. Make sure your family votes. Make sure your friends vote.
Voting is not enough. Yes, you should vote, but you shouldn’t stop at voting. Advocate your position at every opportunity. Protest. Strike. Organize. Help prepare your community for what’s coming.
And would you look at that, DeSantis just recently says he wants to institute the death penalty for all child sex crimes, which doesn’t sound so bad until you remember what they’ve turned “child sex crimes” into a dogwhistle for.
We shouldn’t stoop to political violence, but we should be ready for the fact that they will. They already have. Mass shootings and a goddamn attempted coup have already taken place. Get your community armed and ready to come to each other’s defense, to shelter the most vulnerable, to funnel them to safer places if need be.
