They don’t need Democrat votes in those situations. Democrats can’t assure that Democratic senators don’t vote for Republican judges anyways, and even if they did, they don’t care about getting 51 votes when they only need 50.
You're forgetting a bunch of Trump's Federalist Society judges got votes from Democrats, not to mention Amy fucking Comey Barret.
Banning Democrats from voting for federalist society candidates should be just one card in the deck of a much larger strategy.
Progressive and Democratic leaders should have already been doing this by publicizing and attacking the Federalist Society for its central role in overturning Roe, yet they haven’t, which is a huge fail in messaging.
You do not, under any circumstances, "gotta hand it to" the Federalist Society, but damn if they didn't plan and execute a decades-long mission to accomplish their goal despite it being wildly unpopular. We can't even get moderate Dems on board with "maybe a lack of money shouldn't be a death sentence to sick people".
