Other methods must need to have parts replaced and maintenance waste too - or other waste that is produced as a result. Is it worth writing wind energy off as not worth pursuing in other countries because its not environmentally friendly in other countries who say, rely heavily on coal?
Of course, compared to something like coal plants, wind energy is less emmissive. But compared to other renewable sources such as hydro, nuclear (technically not renewable, but so effecient that it may aswell be), and even solar. Wind energy is just horribly space inefficient, resource intensive, and damaging to surrounding landscapes and wildlife.
Wind energy is not very environmentally friendly, considering the significant waste they produce in replacement parts and lubrication.
I prefer Nuclear to anything. But regardless of this debate over energy sources, the absolute point of this argument. Is that Norway's Supreme Court deemed the installation, illegal. And yet the installation remains operational, 500+ days after the ruling by the Supreme Court of Norway.
