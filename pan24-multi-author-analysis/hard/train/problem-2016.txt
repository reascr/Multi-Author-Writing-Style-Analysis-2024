I’m a straight dude with no interest whatsoever in drag performance, but you can bet that my bearded, fat ass will throw on a dress and lip sync if I feel like it. I’ll do it as a big fuck you to Tennessee, and I’ll do it IN Tennessee. I don’t have a life and would welcome a lenhy legal battle to put these old asshats in their place. Trying to tell grown-ass adults what they can’t wear. Fuck you.
What the fuck does that mean? It's up to interpretation. Is a trans person a male or female impersonator? A butch lesbian? Anyone gender non conforming?
They define a 'drag performance' as basically dressing in opposite gender clothing, so what this means is trans people just trying to live their lives can't, you know, go anywhere kids might be present.
Since to these people assigned sex is all that exists, they implicitly see trans people as full time drag performers. The legislation to ban drag is just a guise for banning trans people.
Anti trans legislation is just the new anti gay marriage. They just need a new wedge issue to rally the hate vote. They always need some boogeyman to be angry at because the Republican platform would never have any support if it was just based on their fuck over the poor policies.
