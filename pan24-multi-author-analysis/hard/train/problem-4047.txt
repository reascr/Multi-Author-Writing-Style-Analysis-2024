Likewise, questioning every Jewish person you encounter for their stance on Israel is not a way to help Palestinians and is in fact antisemitic.
Again, antisemitism has always meant hatred of Jews specifically, regardless of the fact that "semitic peoples" includes more than Jews.
Amy etymological analysis, or maybe an example of antisemitism being used to refer to hatred of people or semitic ethnic descent in general?
And no, being treated as second-class foreigners from the Levant in Europe for centuries does not mean Ashkenazi Jews are “actually European”.
I mean, the difference there is also the Jews come from the area and are also indigenous to the land as well as the Palestinians...
According to people like you, Jews aren’t “Levantine enough” to have a state in the Levant.. but we are “Levantine enough” to be slaughtered for it by Europeans for centuries.
I mean, there isn't a single Jew left in places like Afghanistan, so there isn't anyone left to be doing this to...
Why is all the blame on Israelis when Palestinians won't just accept that Jews are going to live in the region at all? When the PA is literally paying Palestinians to kill innocent Jews in areas that everyone (except them) would say should stay in Israel under any solution. When rockets are being launched from areas Israel unilaterally withdrew from to give them their own independence threatening Israeli civilians who did nothing at all wrong.
