the only thing in here that does anything of substance for anyone is the mandatory withdrawal change.
at which point, if they put the 2k in, even $4000 doesn’t help very much invested into a shitty near-unregulated economy that’s rigging itself into perpetual boom-bust cycles for the benefit of billionaires.
telling companies "you can help pay off your employees' student debt" is meaningless, they already had a way of rewarding employees called "paying more money" that they avoid like the plague & beg the fed to tank the economy to avoid it.
$2k in retirement match from the government for people too poor to put $2k away for retirement in the first place is near meaningless.
>Under the plan, workers who earn below a certain income threshold and contribute to a retirement plan could get a $2,000 match from the government. The income limits are $35,500 for single filers and $71,000 for married taxpayers.
The $2000 government match sounds good, except it’s only for single filers making $35,000 or married making $71,000. That really aught to be stepped up considerably in my opinion….
