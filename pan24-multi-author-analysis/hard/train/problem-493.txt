Then why are Floridians going gaga for DeSantis?? They are getting absolutely hammered by increasingly worse hurricane seasons but they are turning redder than many a hardline red state. They don’t seem to be giving any consideration to climate change. It’s like they think if DeSantis can come up with a witty insult about it, it just doesn’t exist. 🤷🏻‍♀️.
(Watching the evening news last night was painful. People all upset that their ocean front houses were destroyed going “well, there was like 70-100 feet of beach in front of my house, how could I possibly have anticipated a hurricane could do this much damage????” Ummm… because that’s what hurricanes do?? And climate change increases their frequency and severity?? Which is what science has been saying for over 20 years but you built your multi million dollar mansion 70 feet from the ocean anyways and now want federal funds to rebuild.).
It should be. Boomers and GenX will be dead when the worse of climate change will happen. GenZ needs to look out for themselves. The boomers will burn this world to the ground before admitting they made mistakes.
