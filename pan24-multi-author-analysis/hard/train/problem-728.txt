This story is called a narrative-push, these Christians are from liberal congregations or denominations. The petition's sponsor is Faithful America, which organizes social justice-minded Christians to challenge right-wing extremism.
Nope, the petition is from Faithful America which is an organization for social justice-minded Christians.
They certainly implied it by posting it as a response to an article specifically talking about a Christian-led protest petition. And enough people insist that the US is a Christian nation that I hope you can understand why, as a non-Christian, I'm quick to point out that no, Americans are not all Christian, when it seems someone is going that way.
There is a sizable contingent of progressive or at least anti-theocratic Christians in the U.S., but as another user put it we're thousands among millions.
The fact that mere thousands of Christians (out of an estimated 210 million) signed this petition shows just how debased the religion is from its alleged principles.
