Police detained about a dozen people after using water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds in Brussels and eight more in the Northern city of Antwerp.
Dozens of rioters overturned and torched cars, set electric scooters on fire and pelted cars with bricks. Police moved in after one person suffered facial injuries, Brussels police said.
Riots broke out in several Belgian and Dutch cities after Morocco's 2-0 upset win over Belgium at the World Cup on Sunday.
If Marocco wins a match the Dutch/Belgium Moroccans will attempt to burn their own neighbourhood down because they are happy?
It's different because Ajax - Feyenoord is rivalry between two groups of hooligans. What happened now in the Netherlands an Belgium is Morrocans becoming violent because the country they or their parents left won a soccer match. I consider both parties idiots let that be clear. But there is a difference...
Imagine not being able to see the difference. Also I’m not defending ones and attacking others. All shit people. However that “don’t you find it odd” is exactly the problem in Europe.
