Yep, I just posted basically the same thing you said. These "toads" have watched many other politicians (like Trump) lie and get away with it for so long, that this is just normal now and they know there isn't much anyone can do about once they get elected.
Boy, he really is downplaying this shady shit. He needs to resign immediately. Too many Republicans like this guy have learned by watching Trump and other politicians that they can lie, cheat, and steal, and no one will do much about it.
Republicans proudly and by design act in bad faith at every turn in the name of power, dare Dems, Biden, or the DoJ to do something knowing that they won't or can't even if it's deserved.
Dems don't even have to do anything unethical or illegal to get Republicans all worked up...look at the stink they've been trying to raise about Hunter Biden for the past two years. It's a big nothingburger and they can't let it go.
Also, remember their greatest hits from the Obama days: Tan Suitgate, Dijon Mustardgate, Saluting with the Coffee Cupgate, etc., etc.
