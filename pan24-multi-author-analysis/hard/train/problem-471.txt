Yup, and i believe that the capital of South Korea is well within artillery range for the North Korea.
I mean, in the event of a war, isn't North Korea using a significant amount of its artillery fire to pound a civilian centre a good outcome for the South Korean military? Like all the enemy artillery are shooting at a target that isn't posing them any harm, and largely wouldn't hurt the South Korean armed forces, and are letting counter artillery radars locate exactly where they all are.
Imagine if Hitler began the battle of Britain, not by focusing on the airfields, air production, convoys, and radar stations, but on bombing London. It's going to suck a lot in London, but to the RAF it's a pretty good scenario. Like a boxer giving his opponent some free shots to the side just so he could turn to his opponent's kids and should some obscenities at them from the edge of the ring.
Additional counter-point. with modern indirect fire weaponry, which South Korea has a lot of, everything in North Korea is in range, but no one makes the argument that the North Koreans are at a military disadvantage because Pyongyang is in ballistic missile range from land, sea, and air.
If you think with every "test" missile launch that the Korean, US, and Japanese governments aren't out trying to find and recover anything for some intelligence purposes, you'd be out of your mind.
Lmao acting as if shooting an ICBM towards Japan and narrowly missing making everyone think they were about to nuke Japan, wasnâ€™t pushing the situation to an extreme red line.
