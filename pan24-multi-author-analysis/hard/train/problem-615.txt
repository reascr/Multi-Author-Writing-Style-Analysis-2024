It’s not misleading. A large number of people get stuck in that “misleading” cycle and cannot get out without bankruptcy.
These companies use these 800%+ APR for a reason, and they generate money like you wouldn’t believe for a reason, and they aggressively lobby for a reason.
And it isn’t because the “misleading” thing about them is that the APR is misleading. What’s misleading is portraying it as something which is temporary. Well, OxyContin was meant to be temporary as well. And yet Purdue found a way to break the system to make it not temporary. Same with payday loan parasites.
So are Payday loans nasty and exploitative? Yeah I think so. All I'm saying is "OMG LOOK AT THE HUGE APR!" is misleading.
Wellll... I mean I do agree with the notion in that these loans are predatory because if you can't afford to pay your bills this week, adding more charges will simply keep compounding the problem...
It's easy to say you didn't mean to take the discussion away from the core issue of predatory payday loans AFTER you've done so. Why do I say so? Because I've yet to see a single word from you regarding this core issue.
