In this scenario, Democrats win every state they won in 2016 and Republicans and Trump split all the states they won in 2016, with neither getting to 270, right?
The only way that works is if only one of Trump or the Republican is on the ballot in most states. Otherwise, they split the vote and the Democrat wins in places they wouldn't otherwise win. That would have to take coordination between the Republicans and the Trump campaign. A Trump independent run kind of implies he's trying to get revenge on the Republicans so I don't see him partaking in a scheme like this and even if he were to, the odds of the vote going exactly that way are far less than 1 in 3.
Your scenario would require either the Electoral votes NOT be winner take all (which they are) or Trump get enough votes after splitting the Republican party that he actually wins a significant number of states - essentially impossible.
Of course, a more likely "Trump Independent" scenario is that Trump forms a new MAGA party to run under, but isn't on the ballot in most states. Thus, he's a spoiler in a few states - leading to Democrat wins or races that were closer than they would have been without Trump in the race - but doesn't have an effect on other races.
I don't think this would be likely. It would be more likely that an area that's 60% Republican normally goes 35% DeSantis (or whomever else is the Republican nominee), 25% Trump, 40% Democrat which leads to the Democrats winning races that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to win. Then, those electoral votes would go with the Democrat leading to a blowout victory by the Democrats.
You're assuming that Democrats would win all the states that they traditionally win. If the 2016 electoral college repeats itself, but Trump stops DeSantis from getting 270 it goes to the House.
