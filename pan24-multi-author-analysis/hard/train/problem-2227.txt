Most of the time tanks are not battling with other tanks, but rather they are used to support friendly infantry during assaults to enemy positions. This is where quantity wins over quality.
Yes, you are correct. But the biggest reason for this was the wide open desert terrain of Iraq, which made it possible for USA to destroy enemy tanks from further away, where Iraqi's couldn't even fire back.
But the terrain in Ukraine is much more complex with a lot of forests and other elements which makes battles being fought much closer to each other.
Tanks are scary as fuck to defend or attack against so the more there are the harder it is for the enemy, no matter the quality of the tank.
Theyre not good enough to match up against Russian mainline tanks or to break through enemy lines like the much heavier armored Leopard 2 and Abrams.
Essentially I think it just allows more potent tanks to be freed up for frontline action and the Leopard Is can be used in deeper defensive positions. What next though, Chieftains, Centurions and M60s?
The point on life is important - it's probably easier to replace the vehicles themselves than trained crews and the Leopard 1 in particular isn't actually much better armoured than a Bradley...
