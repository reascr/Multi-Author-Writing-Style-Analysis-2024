Frankly, yes. That's the whole point of reuse. When it comes to being green, it's better to reuse/resell than to recycle. Take an old broken computer for example. Instead of attempting to recycle it, a person buys the broken computer, fixes the broken parts, and then converts it to be sold as a home media server or something similar. In terms of overall environmental impact, that is vastly superior to just recycling it.
While I may not fully understand the situation with DOW, but on the surface, this seems better than the costly / chemically intense method of turning them into running tracks. If the shoe is still wearable, then it should be worn. Reselling cost can be used to cover transportation fees.
The bigger issue should be the straight up lying from the company rather than the initiative to reuse / recycle old sneakers.
If most people donated worn out shoes that can't be reused, and Reuters donated shoes in good shape, their shoes are not representative of what happened to most shoes. It might be that most shoes were recycled.
In a poorer country like Singapore If p If shoes are in good shape, people are going to reuse shoes. This may be done by the recycling company, or it may be done by employees picking out the good shoes. It makes environmental sense. However, Dow is going to need to rewrite their press releases and say the shoes will be recycled or reused. In some previous programs, Dow said they would recycle or reuse materials, but this time they seemed to have forgotten to add the words reused.
You are correct. Indonesia is poor, but Singapore is a rich oasis in a poor area. An old boomer like me forgets how far Singapore has come. I have corrected my error. Thank you.
