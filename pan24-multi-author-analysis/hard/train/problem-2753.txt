Not really, they’re letting her keep two subcommittee chairmanships right now, if she caucused with Republicans, she’d lose those plum assignments instantly.
This was the only move she had and it was basically a desperation move. Her only hope is convincing Democrats not to run someone in 2024, and I highly doubt that happens.
That might be too optimistic — Sinema wouldn’t need to get that many swing voters to thwart a Democrat.
eh, don't assume they'd go for her over a republican. She votes with the dems like 90% of the time and as frustrating a narcissist as she is to deal with, I don't think there's much love on the right for her either - she's gonna have a primary to her left and a republican to her right, and she's basically committing political suicide imo.
He's also repping west virginia of all states, he's a coal baron but he's about the best to be expected right now from WVA until their own Fetterman-type breaks through.
Interesting, that does make things more complicated. Obviously you're from AZ so you'd know better than me if center right people out there would find her appealing - only people I know out there are my weird aunt and uncle that follow qanon and hunt ghosts in the desert on a 'semi-professional' basis(...i don't fucking know.) so that may be slightly skewed from your average centrist - which will be the group she relies on for reelection.
And (from July, but I doubt much has changed) shows that Sinema is more popular with independents and Republicans than she is with Dems. If the Dems put up a strong candidate and the GOP runs someone crazy again, Sinema may peel off enough sane, right-leaning voters to hand the seat back to the Dems. If the GOP runs a moderate, though, solid chance they flip it.
No they aren’t; it’s a lot closer than that. It’s more like 35% GOP, 34% independent, 31% Dem (rounded up). Source:
