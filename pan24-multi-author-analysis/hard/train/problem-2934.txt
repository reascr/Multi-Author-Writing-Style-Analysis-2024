This is an absolute mess because the left isn't willing to discuss the nuance of transgender issues with minors - which is an entirely understandable concern. The right makes it much worse by branding it as 'trans bad.'.
It's not though. It's a strawman. The medical community is overwhelmingly in agreement with "the left" on all this stuff. There's outlier anecdotes, sure, but they are indeed outliers and don't invalidate the experience of everyone else.
It's just the typical authoritarian scapegoating of minority groups. It's "out of vogue" to promote slavery, miscegenation, antisemitism, segregation, gay rights, so now we've moved on to the trans community. 10 years down the line when that's been mined for all the political capital it's worth, they'll find another scapegoat. It's the same white conservative, often Christian, American tradition that's been going strong in this country since before it even was America.
Moreover, even if there were more nuance here, the people pushing this anti-trans stuff are only using it to push far right social policy. They are the ones poisoning this well and making such discussion impossible.
