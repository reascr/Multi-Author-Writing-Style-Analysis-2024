I'm really willing to bet that every POTUS and VPOTUS has or had classified documents found, and everyone but Trump simply handed them back and apologized for the error. It's only even come to our attention because of Trump's willful mishandling and unwillingness to cooperate.
In reality, neither should be posted, because both Biden and Pence are doing the right thing and working to get the documents back in the right place.
If Pence and Biden had some classified documents laying around that were able to be boxed up when they left vice-presidency, I am guessing it was mostly crap like this. I think what the takeaway from the BIden\\Pence stuff is that classification and everything around it needs a reworking. This stuff, someone is supposed to bring it to you then take it back. If it really is important secret stuff, the taking it back part needs to be looked at for what 's going on. If it isn't important things, I think we need some rules around how mundane stuff like schedules and talking points can be declassified more easily or automatically.
LoL. I remember with Hilary Clinton, one that Republicans were going so hysterical about. She had a meeting planned with some foreign diplomat. So she had a list of things to go over, which got marked classified as they didn't want others to know what would be discussed until it was time to discuss them. When the time came, she had her person send her the talking points, at which moment, there was no longer a reason for them to be classified, because she was already at the point where she was talking about what was on her list. But years later, they were still marked classified and people were in their faux outrage mode over it.
