“This means users can no longer include a link to their profiles on other social networks in their Twitter bio, nor can they link to their posts on banned platforms unless it’s a cross-post. Twitter also says it may suspend accounts “used for the main purpose of promoting content on another social platform” and will no longer allow users to link to third-party link aggregators, like Linktree or Lnk.bio. Twitter is fine with the paid promotion of these banned platforms, however.”.
“Twitter abruptly bans all links to Instagram, Mastodon, and other competitors / The platform will still allow the paid promotion of these banned social platforms, however.”.
So Twitter is no longer useful for influencers, artists, businesses or anyone who wants to promote anything.
Twitter is on a speedrun to become the most user-hostile social media platform, so much for free speech absolutism and making Twitter better for its content creators.
At any rate, most of the larger entities on Twitter use it for headlines meant to direct traffic to other platforms without character limits where official announcements can be thoroughly detailed. It will be interesting to see how well that works now.
