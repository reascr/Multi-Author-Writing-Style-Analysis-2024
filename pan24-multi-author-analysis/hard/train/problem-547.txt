Sadly there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Even the "success stories" of capitalism like Finland and Norway are propped up by exploiting the poorest people in the world.
The problem is from finnish viewpoint they are basically being exploited as slaves, bad working conditions, no workers rights, bad pay etc.
People working without a proper contract is called svartjobbare (black workers) and yes, its not only illegal but also a big problem in many Swedish sectors.
“There have been reports of wages going unpaid, passports being held by unscrupulous bosses and some labourers working up to 148 days in a row.
What’s stopping the worker going to their embassy and getting travel papers to go home ? Their problems aren’t with their passports or ability to leave, but with the agent who sent them and is expecting payment.
So true, so all the more reason for the employer to pay for flights, food and accommodation so that the Thai national is an employee rather than an indentured servant. Let’s see how the Finns react to this, will they accept more expensive berries to improve the workers lives ?
