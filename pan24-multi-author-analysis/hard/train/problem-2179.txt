I think your response could be a bit more nuanced. For instance, despite you seeing polling strongly suggesting evolution of the GOP's beliefs on gayness or bisexuality, many of those same people whose thinking may have changed are still fine with having homophobes and transphobes in their party.
It was brought up by you after you called for nuance shortly before. There is no room for nuance in perfection. Which, again, you injected into this conversation by assuming someone pushing back against your claims of evolution was pointing out a lack of perfection.
How is a comment regarding the degree of evolution or lack thereof irrelevant to a comment regarding something or someone's evolution?
Again, I think the other commenter completley missed the point of my comment and the meaning of the terms 'evolution' and 'evolved.' Looking at either means looking at a time in the past (e.g. 1980, 1990, 2000 or another year) and comparing attitudes at that time to now. Looking at evolution/evolved is not about analyzing current events separate and apart from some prior point of reference.
