There's a very significant difference between "deleting data" and "deleting" a reference to a specific study in a fact sheet. The letter you linked and the original article it references from The Reload both refer to it as deleting a reference to the Kleck survey from the early 90s (the study in question). Even if you want to criticize that decision--and there is a perfectly valid criticism that can at least be argued--framing it as deleting data is a blatantly misleading framing of the matter.
If an agency supposedly driven by science and not politics is actively deleting information because of politics they suck and should be replaced with people who actually believe in presenting all the data.
And there is literally absolutely nothing preventing them from simply updating that data with any of the data from any of the studies done over the years or them from doing that study given they had no restrictions for the last 5 years.
Sorry but that is shit science and we deserve better than that and those actions are not the fault or responsibility of the evil and apparently omnipresent and omnipotent NRA.
