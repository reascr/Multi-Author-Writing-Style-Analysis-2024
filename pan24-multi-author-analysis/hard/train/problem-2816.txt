They rigged those too. For example, for decades there's been a consistently blue seat in a very rural area, so they split the blue voters in half into two other districts to get rid of them.
The problem with it in blue states is that the courts tend to be less friendly to gerrymandering and more willing to strike down the most extreme electoral maps.
For a state that is split pretty evenly, the gerrymandering has skewed the state to ridiculous levels.
It's not going backwards it's unrigging the game and it would have gave Democrats a chance to take control in states like Wisconsin when they receive more votes. It is incredible important to end state and congressional maps that can give results like , , , , and.
So these maps basically made it so as long as they get somewhere between 40-45% of the vote to get a majority in state houses and got some stupid maps for Congress that make no sense.
The idea that 60% of the senate should need to vote yes on pre-votes for actual votes that only need 50%+1 to become law has let the minority stop the majority from fixing the skewed maps.
