Mobilizing doesn't require the forced conscription and imprisonment of those who don't want to fight. Ukrainians have the right to defend themselves as all people do, they don't have the right to force others to defend them though.
Yeah, totally support Ukraine's need to defend themselves but conscription is fucked up. I never got why militaries wanted a bunch of people who didn't believe in the cause and weren't willing to die anyways.
I don't see that as a justification for seizing people and forcing them to fight or be killed against their will.
Its entirely possible a segment of that 9 million might not be fighting if they have been given a choice. This is the problem with drafts. Its an attempt to strip people of their right to choose and force them to fight against their will.
The alternative is to ask the people who want to fight to fight and not try and force the ones who don't. If your country is actually worth anything you'll have enough people volunteer. If you can't get enough people to volunteer the country is probably not worth saving anyway.
If a country is worth fighting for people will choose to fight for it if you have to force them then the country isn't that great.
