The driver was a Palestinian permanent resident of East Jerusalem, meaning that he held an Israeli ID and could, if he so chose, become an Israeli citizen. He was not an Israeli.
Look up the Israeli settlement program. Would you trust someone who was already illegally occupying those land and the United Nations did nothing about it?
Because they couldnâ€™t trust the rest of the world to back them when the government changed hands. Not to mention it did t help that far-right Israelis kept agitating things and baiting the Palestinians into rioting to help blow up the talks.
It was going downhill before that when the palestinians kept on perpetrating terrorist attacks made easier by Rabin why was trying to achieve a peaceful settlement.

Your statement at the about follow up care and his actual release are very relevant points regardless of how he may have been indoctrinated.
