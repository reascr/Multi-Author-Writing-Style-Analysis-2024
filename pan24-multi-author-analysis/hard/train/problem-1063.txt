Private equity is also buying up mobile home parks, raising the rent, evicting those who can't pay - rinse and repeat. It is an assault on those with limited incomes like the elderly, single parents, etc.
Amid a national housing crisis, giant private equity firms have been buying up apartment buildings en masse to squeeze them for profit, with the help of government-backed Freddie Mac. Meanwhile, tenants say theyâ€™re the ones paying the price.
Yes, but they're only buying because they can get more in rent than their mortgage. That's due to the supply of housing.
There's a housing shortage in the US. Zoning regulations caused it. Prices go up when there are shortages. Stop gaslighting people and just admit this already.
Socialist, like conservatives, are very hostile to empirical evidence if it conflicts with their preexisting ideology. The reality is that supply and demand exist regardless of whether or not you believe in it.
There's nothing in my post that argues against supply and demand. Supply is and has been deliberately restricted, both by our ruling class, and NIMBYs, and small time landlords.
The reality is that average people are the ones who lobbied the government to restrict supply. Large investors were actually pretty late to the party, only buying up a small share of the housing stock well after regulations had created higher prices.
