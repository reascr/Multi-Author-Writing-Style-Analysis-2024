They are convinced no one sees through their bs. They are convinced Donnie the T won, they are convinced they are on the good side. They are convinced of a lot of things. There is nothing to publicly prove wrong and if you did they would not be convinced.
The convinced ones know the truthâ€¦.they cannot say it out loud because then they would be revealed as the Putin shills they are. You and I are convinced they know this too.
You are correct. He said that in the first half of his January 6th speech before his supporters March down to the Capitol at his direction. In that speech, he also said:
That said, one could also argue that requesting a mob of people to interfere with the proceedings of the legislative branch could also be considered the executive branch interfering with the legislative branch.
Well if the President used the means at his disposal to "protect the capital" without giving any notice or being formally invited to do so, then that could be seen as the executive branch interfering with the legislative branch.
I'm interested in why you say it is defeatist conjecture rather than recognizing it to be a statement under oath by a person who was working in the executive branch at the time.
