So I really think this is a bill for women with Endometriosis and they don’t even realize it? Or are keeping the wording obtuse so people won’t question it? If less than 10% of women are asking to use it that lines up with Endo stats.
I’m 26, have had problems since I was an early teen. My mom has endo. The first doc she took me to was a gynae who told us she was pushing me to hard and that’s why I was in pain and it as “anxiety”. Fun fact I never had anxiety until all these doctors told me my pain was anxiety. Then I was like damn I must be anxious all the time to be in this much pain! And then a feedback loop occurs .
Edit — I really think we all should just be able to get the sick leave we need on a case by case basis ¯\\__(ツ)__//¯.
Country policies need to mandate appropriate sick leave policies and enforce leave for all workers who need days off when sick - for whatever the reason. A specific policy for just one reason I might be out, that gives employers a reason to prefer not to hire me, doesn’t seem helpful.
