Inb4 we have people saying America does the same to Chinese waters, ignoring the whole international ruling against China and their absurd territory grab attempt.
To say that Japan 'administered' the islands since the late 1800s when they basically claimed it as part of a broader imperialistic war and then claiming this is Chinese imperialism in action is just wrong.
Japan effectively annexed the islands during the first Sino-Japanese war, prior to that the oldest historical records even vaguely suggest any claim comes from the Chinese side.
No one owns it because it's disputed. Taiwan's claims are just as legitimate as anyone else's. Read up on the history of the islands. It's no more Japan's than Taiwan's or China's, that's why it's disputed and it's hard to settle the dispute.
What is absolutely true is that Japan currently administers it, and neither Taiwan nor China likes it.
China and Taiwan posit their claims mainly because of their proximity to the islands, and some historical records. Japan stipulates their claims from its late 19th century survey and the islands’ status of terra nullius at the time.
At the end of the day, we are all but humans, and these are just artificial lines and names on the map, but I do think it is important to look a bit more into the claims before further discussions.
I claim no neutrality to this issue: I’m a US citizen of Chinese descent, and this issue is a sticking point in Sino-Japanese relations and one of the very few things that both Chinas agree and cooperate.
