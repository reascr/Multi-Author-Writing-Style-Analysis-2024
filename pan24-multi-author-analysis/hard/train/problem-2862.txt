Exit polls give one indication of the ages represented, and I believe there is public information about who voted, though of course not how they vote. And yes, I'm talking about the under 25 group. Here's a PBS article about the trend which cites their sources:
The reason I believe the elections are so often very close is because the youth on both sides would largely prefer not to bother, and can only be goaded into action when it's close. I hope that I'm wrong and that the youth will learn that they really can make a difference, and are creating voting habits that will persist, but I don't expect that.
I’m curious where you get your information and would like to add the point that “youth” implies young voters. Not sure how young you are personally thinking but I imagine anyone under age 25. To be fair, they haven’t had an opportunity to vote when it wasn’t a big deal or “close”.
If the last two elections showed us anything, If they keep showing up it will get better every time. Even more important. With these races so close, every vote counts.
2016 was the first election where I was old enough to vote. It’s weird that democracy itself being at stake in every election almost seems normal to me.
