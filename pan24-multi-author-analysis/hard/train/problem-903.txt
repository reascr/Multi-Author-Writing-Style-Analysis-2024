Also, let's give it to him, he keeps it on track. I mean Likud, Shas, Yehudat haTora - they are around since forever, and their objectives - whatever they are - didn't change. As to the centrist parties (which is our hope to form a coalition) - I can't even keep track of what they are called, let alone of what their position is.
The major parties won't form a coalition together, so the governing party is whichever one can make the best offer to all of the special interest parties. The last few governments have even had a rotating cabinet and even rotating prime ministers in the same coalition.
I understand proportional representation has some fans, but it's very obviously failing to produce a stable government in Israel.
Israel uses an unusual form of government, proportional representation, where a party that gets 5% of the vote gets 5% of the seats.
And when they do, it really only lasts until the other party can negotiate a better offer. That's why they've had five different coalitions in three years.
