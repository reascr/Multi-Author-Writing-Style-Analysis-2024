So at this point WWIII would be what? NATO vs Russia, Belarus, Iran, NK, who else? Will China or India get involved or just try to profit as much as possible. Or would China use the distraction to open up a whole different theater? I don't know enough for anything but wild speculation but I'm just curious what the prevailing geopolitical analysis' are if something wider kicks off from Ukraine, armchair or actually qualified opinions are fine- just kind of want a picture.
That's a good breakdown. So maybe three distinct theaters- Pacific, Russian\European, and Middle Eastern.
That's a fun one. My underdog is always The Principality of Sealand. They might have already sent a drone to Ukraine though so they're probably locked in.
These drones getting smuggled to Hamas would be a nightmare scenario for Israel. The Iron Dome reportedly isn't good at hitting objects that can maneuver. Hamas going from only having shitty unguided rockets that don't even make it to the general area of their target 1/4th of the time to having a drone that could potentially slip past the iron done and target specific places for maximum casualties would be bad news for everyone.
