Even the youngest voters for Obama in 2008 are 32 now. Not really the "youth vote" demographic. The jaded Obama voter isn't the youth vote anymore, they're middle-aged.
The "youth vote" is 18-24 years old. I'm not saying people in their 30s are "old", but they're not part of the "youth vote" demographic any more.
I mean, notably, that link shows that 18-29 year olds are 9% of the total vote, not 9% turnout for that age group. Given that 18-29 year olds are about 14-15% of Georgia’s total population, it’s not… completely terrible. It’s still only about 20% turnout with early votes, but still 4x what 2018’s early youth vote was, and 2x the total vote youth vote from that year.
In GA, early voting makes it look pretty clear that young people are not showing up. That could all change tomorrow, of course, but only time will tell.
It still makes no sense to punish young people by voting against their best interest. Furthermore, not only are youth today faced with the reality of having lower standard of living, fewer rights, and potentially permanent loss of political influence, they are also going to be saddled with the care of their elderly parents. Hurting the young is bad for young people, but potentially catastrophic for the old.
