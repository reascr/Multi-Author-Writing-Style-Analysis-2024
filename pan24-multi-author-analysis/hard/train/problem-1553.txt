Probably a little of column A and a little of column B. It's not really a threat any more than an LEO but shooting it down could cause a public relations disaster if someone gets killed, while leaving it up in the sky generates a ton of negative publicity toward China. That negative publicity leads to official trips being postponed, affects the US position in negotiations/relations, etc. Meaning, the government would like to take a tougher stance on China without appearing to be too aggressive as it could have economic impacts, but the balloon gives them an excuse.
This is probably a stupid question…but is there a way for the US to capture and study tech attached to the balloon to see if China’s reasoning are true or not? It being in the US’s airspace makes it fair game, no?
In theory, it's in US airspace, the US can intercept it. However, they likely want to see where it is going to try and get an idea of what China is trying to scope.
I mean, they likely are, it's just not public. But now that they public is aware of it, private citizens are tracking.
There's probably little risk because most major assets aren't visible openly, and those that are can be seen on any number of sources anyway.
