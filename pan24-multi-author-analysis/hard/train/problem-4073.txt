This article completely ignores that Anderson Lee Aldrich, who recently murdered 5 at Club Q in Colorado, had a grandfather who as an elected Republican California state representative, actively encouraged violent insurrection:
"This is Lexinon and Concord. First shots fired against tyranny," is what he had to say just three days after the January 6 insurrection. It really isn't any stretch to think that impressionable young minds are being influenced by this kind of poison.
The US is the only country in the world which has this kind of problem with mass shooting. We're up to nearly two a day. So is it really grotesque politicization to talk about why that is?
It is political. It's about gun policies that don't represent the wishes or needs of the people. What's grotesque is the right continuing to protect gun manufacturers and their profits at the cost of people's lives.
It is just wild to me to think that not wanting to be killed by a random shooter who has access to an assault rifle is a political issue. I absolutely cannot comprehend that concept.
