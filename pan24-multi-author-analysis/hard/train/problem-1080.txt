Everyone suffers if nukes star flying around. It just devastates both sides, and Putin is willing to go down swinging, in that sense it's better to not star world war 3.
- an all-out conflict with the West, in which case it might also end in a total destruction of Russia as a country and culture.
Russians have just created a new hot-spot in the world, and its resolution will rest on a total defeat of one of the parties. After this, normal coexistence is no longer possible and Putin is counting on future Russian leaders to be aware of this and pursue his policy until one of the following:
Russian leadership is pushing its own country into the corner. Now it's all or nothing for Russia, because if, after this, they only go for a partial occupation of Ukraine and call it quits, they can be 100% sure Ukraine will try to massively remilitarize and enact revenge (unless Russia succeeds in removing the current Ukrainian leadership and force Ukraine to accept unfavourable terms, like perpetual neutrality).
Previous top Russian general was fond of Power Grid destruction… it did not help much, so he was replaced with one who prefers to go for civilian casualties in most direct way… neither “strategies” (for the lack of better word) make any sense… but at this point no strategy which does not include removal of Putin and withdrawal from Ukrainian territory would make sense. And there is no one in Russian “power structures” with balls to do it.
This is important to remember with Russia. We project humanity on them. They project their unique Russian point of view onto everyone else.
