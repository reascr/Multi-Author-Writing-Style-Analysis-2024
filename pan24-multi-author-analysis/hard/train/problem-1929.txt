They must be using the GVA definition to arrive at those numbers, and typically claim there are hundreds of mass shootings a year, because no other rational source uses that defintion. Not Motherjones and not the government.
The thing is, I don’t know how one would want a government to do that. Would there be some bureau which sets rules such as: “Any news which doesn’t seem like our definition of news must display a banner reading ‘This information may not be news’”?
See what I mean? And beyond that: What are the criteria, who decides them? Does congress fund this entity to (quite literally) abridge press by letting its staff determine what is press/isn’t press? And can that body perform its job without being in some perverse role as the arbiters of “Truth vs Falsehood”?
Something (and others like it) like this would force them actually say the truth, or spend a large amount of time correcting it. After X amount of infractions your segment gets taken off the air replaced with nothing, first for a determined amount of time, progressively getting larger for repeat offenders. Hit them where it hurts, time (on air) and $.
Good questions, but also, any segment that is proven false, the network needs to use the same amount of time, correcting the false statement.
