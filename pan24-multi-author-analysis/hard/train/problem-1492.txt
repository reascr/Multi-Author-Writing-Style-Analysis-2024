Harassment only gets reported when you piss off a mod, in all honesty Reddit needs a huge uprising against the mods. I’m not saying the site should change in its current state, Mods have taken full control of many subs for good and bad, but that’s not their job.
I mean twitter, in all honesty has never cared… let alone the whole cutting sub culture that has existed on the platform. It’s really messed messed up they are trying to frame it under this, I hate the guy…but this is clickbait. Twitter has always been this, teen suicide rates have skyrocketed since the creation of social media…I mean that show on Netflix had to add a suicide warning because it was directly tied to children killing themselves. plus they changed the title.
The title literally says it’s being revamped, and I’m assuming you know all the intricacies of said company? Not the title op posted, the actual article headline.
It’s not an obsession, it’s just calling people like you out. It’s really nothing more. Things have devolved so much, most of you won’t pay attention to anything unless it dealigns with your perverted sense of politics, let alone acting how you are somehow now noble. It’s really nothing more, I hate Musk, never used twitter, voted dem and progressive my whole life. It’s really just calling out a hollowness that allows lies to build. No more, no less. Twitter always sucked, and your’re getting rage baited into headlines to push ad revenue, that you would never get if someone else owned it and did the same things.
Twitter’s response reads more like a “oh, shit, people don’t like what we did” attempt at public relations damage control. The original interpretation—that it was intentionally removed—seems more likely. Or even just that it was mistakingly disabled due to a bug. But taking it down to revamp it? That’s probably the least-likely explanation.
