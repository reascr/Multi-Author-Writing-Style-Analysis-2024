Biden was not president at the time, nor did he even hold public office. Biden had absolutely no leverage with the government of Ukraine. I've never seen a shred of evidence that directly ties Joe Biden to his son getting that job or any shady activities involved.
1) Even though there is no evidence of this, Joe Biden pulled strings to get Hunter that position. This was before the war. This was before we even had significant dealings with Ukraine. And most importantly, this was a private citizen helping his son get a job. I'm not sure how people think Joe Biden would have anything to gain by helping his son get a job at a random electric company in one of the most impoverished countries in Europe.
2) Hunter Biden embellished his political ties in order to score the job. Did Hunter make promises that he may or may not have been able to deliver on? You'd have to ask him. But even if he lied through his teeth about what he could bring to the table, that's a Hunter Biden problem, not a Joe Biden problem. Joe Biden was a private citizen at the time.
I would argue talking about Hunter Biden is as relevant as talking about Don Jr. or Eric Trump though. It's fine if you don't want to hear about that stuff, but it will be talked about on TV, and here.
You donâ€™t have to turn tv on to distract kids. They are already spell-bound by the crap on their phone. Remember when Republicans were certain the Durham probe was going to expose all kinds of shenanigans on the part of Hillary and the Dems. And what happened? Exactly.
