France has done plenty of shady stuff in Africa, and they shouldnâ€™t be talking, but can we talk about the xenophobic messagIng in Wakanda Forever (I just watched it for the first time)? Like every time there was a scene suggesting the that American government might actually be evil, the next scene distracts the audience with an angry mesoamerican who framed as the real bad guy. Also, Wakanda is repeatedly vindicated for their isolationism. There was plenty I liked about the movie, but it felt like the whole thing was playing on xenophobic American prejudices.
The "scary Mexican invaders" in this particular movie are as xenophobic as you can possibly get. They want to destroy everyone else on Earth just because they might be discovered one day lol. Even Hitler didn't want to kill everyone.
You do realize that the US did not exist yet when the backstory for this particular villain happened, right?
Yes, the US did not exist in this villain's backstory, but he was written as a villain by Americans. I'm not claiming that he wasn't a bad dude in the movie, but that by writing him as a villain the filmmakers demonized Mesoamerican people and reinforced and profited from the prejudices of American audiences.
