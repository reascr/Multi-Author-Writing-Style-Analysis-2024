The argument apparently is that the federal court agrees that it was improper to suspend him, but notes that the federal court lacks the authority to reinstate him for violating state law.
And that judge did add that “These other factors could not properly be the basis for a suspension under the Florida Constitution—there were no blanket non-prosecution policies, no neglect of duty, and no incompetence.” Pointing out that Warren's removal was a violation of FL's Constitution, and was basically telling them to appeal in the state.
“The suspension also violated the Florida Constitution, and that violation did affect the outcome,” Hinkle wrote. “But the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from awarding declaratory or injunctive relief of the kind at issue against a state official based only on a violation of state law.”.
And no federal courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state law decisions. If a decision in state court involves federal law, it can be appealed or removed to federal court, but without the federal law hook, federal courts lack jurisdiction to rule on state law claims. They do not rule on appeals cases that involve state law.
The case questioned both a violation of state law AND a 1st amendment violation. The state law claim was pretty much immediately dismissed because of the 11th amendment. Even DeSantis acknowledge that the 1st amendment claim was justifiable.
And technically no. Federal courts have appellate jurisdiction and can rule on appeals cases that involve state law (as long as the question is whether the state law violates federal law).
