No because there's a fundamental difference, if Santos actually isn't a citizen he is legally not allowed to take office. If there had been voter fraud in 2020 I would support it being fully investigated and legal remedies taken, Trump lost 52 lawsuits about the 2020 election because he had no evidence.
Santos is either a US citizen or not, that can be decided with evidence and then we act on the evidence. If a democrat did it I'd support the same thing, they can't take office if they're not a citizen.
Not at all, there is doubt if he is even a US citizen. He's lied about everything else how do we know he's telling the truth about being born in NY? Immigration should absolutely be investigating him. Note that even if he got naturalized at some point if he's found to have lied on immigration documents they can and should take away his citizenship.
A habitual liar suspected of fraud who obtained citizenship by an alleged green card marriage third in line for the presidency with an ACTIVE arrest warrant in a foreign nation. Now this is the new story lines I was hoping for in 23.
