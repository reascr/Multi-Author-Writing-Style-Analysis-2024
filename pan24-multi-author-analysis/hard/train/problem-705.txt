Putin is following the plan payed out by the Russian Geopolitical thinkers. The first step is to take Ukraine and it’s manufacturing base and natural resources; coupled with a land bridge to Transnistria, it’s sets up the next invasion points to push into Poland and Central Europe.
I hope we get to the point where the Russian Legion of the Ukrainian Forces can return home and fix their own country!
C’mon Europe! Ukraine is doing all the bleeding for the west right now, the least we can do is hurry up the tanks, the GLDMs, and the anti air stuff for them.
So if the west did nothing, we’d have a newly energized, refueled, fresh with plunder Russian army.
Regardless, to attack nato countries Russia would have to move material across a hostile freshly conquered nation.
This is a case of non NATO country fending off Russia, if Russia invaded Poland that would be the full deployment of NATO forces.
If these pro-russia / anti-nato right-wing leaders get elected and Russia wins in Ukraine, there is a possibility of Russia attacking EU or Nato nation in the future.
The point is, that there is more than 0% chance that Russia manages to divide western countries to the point which makes alliances like NATO fall apart. For example USA leaving NATO (which Trump said is a possibility if he was president), or France leaving NATO (LePen said she wants to leave as well).
