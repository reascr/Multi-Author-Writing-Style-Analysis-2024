One thought I keep coming back to is how, in the weeks leading up to Election Day we were seeing so many polls favoring the Republicans winning, which was clearly part of their strategy. I wonder if that perhaps ended up backfiring on them.
Perhaps relying on a bunch of questionable polls to project a resounding victory was not a great move on their part.
Their big takeaway was to read and believe the margin of error for these polls. Despite the big surprising wins overall for Democrats, virtually all of these results fall within the margin of error for the polls. There were also corrections in virtually every poll to increase estimates of GOP turnout based on the last 2 election cycles. It seems likely they overestimated that turnout but not by much. Polls were always an in exact science but we got spoiled by how good they were for a decade or so. Those days are gone, believe the margin of error.
Agreed. I live in a place where my vote doesn’t matter. I will be completely washed away by the volume from the other side. I completely ignore that, I read up on the candidates, learn about any ballot initiatives or bond proposals, and I vote knowing I’m tilting at windmills but the only way that outcome will ever change is if I and a lot of like minded voters get out there and vote. I’m not waiting for the polls to say everyone else is ready, I just cast my vote and move on.
I would never and have never poll’d prior to the official vote. There’s zero reason to vote more than once- especially considering that they literally can’t/won’t reach everyone who is going to ultimately vote anyway.
