No. I disagree. The net effect of all of that noise would be to diminish the public’s confidence in elections generally. “If everyone is cheating, what does it matter, why bother voting? Who cares?” Etc.
Does it matter if the DNC cares? It is not up to them to determine if election fraud occurred. It is up to the courts, which so far has not seen any evidence of massive voter fraud like those on the right keep screaming about. Many of these judges in these courts where installed by the Trump administration, and even they do not believe the baseless claims of voter fraud, because there is just no evidence of it.
"Even though there's clear evidence of malfeasance by the Maricopa County bord of electors, it's the GOP who's really committing voter fraud here".
It’s wise to not make a big deal out of one off instances of voter fraud that are caught and prosecuted because the system is working as intended.
Well look at most of the actual small time voter fraud that comes out is repubs. It’s literally a small article and you never hear about it again. Dems should be going nuts with commercials everytime a repub is caught doing voter fraud. Then end the commercial with even though this person cheated it wouldn’t change the results.
