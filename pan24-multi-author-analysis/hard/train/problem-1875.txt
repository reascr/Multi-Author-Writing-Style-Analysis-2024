I believe they also have 100 Typhoon jets, even if a handful of them are in working order is still directs the heat at the UK breaking the taboo so others can send theirs.
Sending Typhoons is a ridiculous idea: we don't have spare jets, Ukrainian pilots don't know how to fly them, there are no trained maintenance crews etc. Apart from these issues it's a great idea.
Details like pilots, ammo, maintenance are boring "details for the backroom boffins". One reason Brexit remains a mess: he couldn't get his head round all the complexities. Not a trait you want in a PM ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Poland was originally going to send Russian jets in exchange for new US-made ones. That is the best plan if jets are going to be sent.
And who's going to fly the jets? Doesn't training to become a fighter pilot take years? In all honesty the west should've started arming and training Ukrainians when Putin invaded Crimea. Now the west is playing catch up and it could be to late for Ukraine. Russia has a population of 140 million while Ukraine has a population of 40 million. The west is dragging it's feet with supplying Ukraine with all the weapons and training it needs to win. If the west acted swiftly in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea then things might have been different. I hope Ukraine wins but we all know Russia will just keep throwing their citizens into the meat grinder that is Ukraine and Ukraine is running low on ammo.
I really don't agree with tanks and worst fighter jets they are not a good idea what the ukrainians gonna do take crimea and bomb moscow. This is escalating a regional war to something. Why not force the ukrianians to come down and give up crimea and guarantee water with a price and sort the situation with the donbass.
