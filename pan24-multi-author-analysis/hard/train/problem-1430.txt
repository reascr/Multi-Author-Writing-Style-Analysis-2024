That's my line of thinking on it, too. I don't care if it was Ukraine's missile, it wouldn't have been in the air at all had Russia stayed the fuck home instead of invading a sovereign nation.
Ukraine wants them to say it’s Russia to get more supplies, nato doesn’t want Poland to say it’s territorial integrity was threatened, Russia is fucked either way.
Ukraine does have potentially much more to gain by it being a Russian missile, or at the very least perceived as a Russian missile- even though it is already perceived to be Russia's fault regardless. For one, it could have galvanized the west into further supplying Ukraine with better weapons and defense systems... which they still very well can and likely will do any way.
It could also provide leverage to get Belarus to push back against Russia firing missiles from it's south western border with Ukraine too.
If the missile was indeed fired by Russia, it would be a good excuse for NATO to setup a no-fly or missile defense zone within a certain distance of Poland's border.
The most plausible scenario for this would be that it was in fact a stray Ukrainian S-300 and all the evidence available to NATO as well as Russia easily prove that.
It could have instead galvanized the west and Poland into supplying Ukraine with even more advanced weapons and defense systems to further weaken Russia... which is in NATO's and Poland's interest... in which case why lie about it not being Russian?
Which would let NATO get partially involved and help Ukraine defend it's western side. Ukraine could then concentrate their anti-air systems more to the east to try to stop the infrastructure bombings.
