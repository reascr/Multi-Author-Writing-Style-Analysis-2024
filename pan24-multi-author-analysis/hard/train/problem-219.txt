Have you not been paying attention? Reality scarcely matters, as long as the propaganda machine that vomits into the minds of as many Americans as it does between Fox, conservative radio, Sinclair group, Rupert Murdoch's other publications including tabloids, Facebook, etc. There is no final "gotcha".
Hey, I'm still going to vote. I'm going to do what I can to get everyone I know to vote. But that's mostly because I want to know that I did what I could and want a clear conscience, not because I have a lot of faith in people not falling for the propaganda. And they clearly are falling for the propaganda, because the fact that Republicans can be as blatantly fucked up as they are and still break the numbers they do should terrify everyone.
A significant number of Republicans have been up to some extremely unethical shit. And the only way to prevent these chickens from coming home to roost is by decimating the professional non-partisan staff of the House Ethics Committee (the Office of Congressional Ethics).
