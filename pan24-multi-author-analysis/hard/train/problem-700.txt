The relevant issue here is race, since one of the issues of this bill is to protect interracial marriage. She is of Han decent. Which is more commonly referred to as racially Chinese.
Han Chinese is the largest ethnic group but there are smaller ethnic groups as well. I appreciate your attempt to continue the conversation even if you can't quite get the facts correct.
However, look how the redditor worded his response. Instead of just saying Mitch McConnell is in an interracial marriage or saying Mitch McConnell is married to someone of Han Chinese ethnic descent, the redditor consciously chose the inflammatory "Chinese woman" trope with all the historical and contemporary baggage associated with United States and China relations -- the user even refused to type her name.
To casually say she's a "Chinese woman" brings connotations of the People's Republic of China and all the baggage associated with it.
Case in point -- in 2013 the liberal super PAC Progress Kentucky released a series of tweets in a similar vein by attempting to directly connect Chao with China. In one tweet, the organization said.
