Will there ever be a resolution to determine the fate of Nagorno-Karabakh / Artsakh? I can't imagine that the Armenian and Azerbaijani people want to be in this situation forever.
The real blocking point is that Azerbaijan has ambitions on Armenia and, as I said, Turkey will always back Azerbaijan. So long as that remains unresolved Turkey will always obstruct any Armenia-NATO rapproachment. Their leadership might not be happy with what Aliyev is doing, but they've spent so long propagandizing for Azerbaijan domestically they couldn't change courses if they wanted to (even though providing diplomatic cover within NATO for Azerbaijan is costing them heavily).
The US will continue to do nothing because Turkey and Azerbaijan are married at the hip and Turkey is more valuable than Armenia geopolitically. That's the ugly truth.
He was very open about his goal being ethnic cleansing before restarting the conflict two years ago. It didn't matter then internationally and is also an important part of his domestic branding.
Partially, but it's more because the Azeris are a Turkic people and Turkey will always back Azerbaijan. Turkey would be quite fine pretending the genocide never happened and having an actual relationship with Armenia (as it stands they do a lot of mental gymnastics to justify that they have no problems with Armenia or Armenians, and the problems are solely with Armenia's government). It's Armenia that would be the problem - they want Turkey to admit to the genocide first - but the situation dictates pragmatism and they've made multiple attempts to reach out to Turkey anyway.
