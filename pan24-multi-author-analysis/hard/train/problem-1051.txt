He wouldn't be. A defendant that ONLY possesses a pound of weed could be charged with simple possession which has a maximum of one year incarceration. If the federal prosecutors can prove the defendant intended to distribute or sale that one pound the maximum penalty would be five years incarceration.
A January article padded with rampantly incorrect information - nevermind, the defendant received 11 years (well the court adjudicated the sentence in months) instead of three years as the law professor speculated.
That's policy. Now COVID complications and federal prison camps (especially camps with drug programs) being full complicate placement. That fictitious prisoner could be placed into a low security prison until an opening becomes available.
Part of the reason most white collar criminals are placed into low security prisons is because those prisons are CHEAPER per inmate.
TBH, no sensible government would waste $$$ putting an almost certainly nonviolent inmate in a high security prison.
