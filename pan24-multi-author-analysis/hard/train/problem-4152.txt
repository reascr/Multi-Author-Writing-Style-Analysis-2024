Exactly. Fuck the Trump administration and everyone who enabled him for a payday (or whatever reason), but…this isn’t a good thing either. The American people need to have a political party tied to the middle and working class, not the corporations that exploit them.
I mean, this doesn’t threaten the foundation of our country or democracy in any direct way, but it’s still pretty sleazy. It also has the net effect of pulling politicians further from the people they ostensibly represent.
People generally have a bad view of politicians who use their time in office to enrich themselves afterwards.
The problem is that we don’t have an active, educated electorate and politicians who are blatantly corrupt will get re-elected. If we actually ousted corrupt politicians, the corporate sector jobs for them (and their aides) would dry up. Corrupt people will always find another method to be corrupt, rather than try to legislate against a method, we need to elect people who aren’t corrupt.
Or, to put it another way, how exactly could we get politicians to create and enforce that law without first reducing corruption by voting out the ones who are corrupt and voting in new ones who aren’t?
It’s not that politicians moving into private sector is bad, it’s the corruption that comes from politicians listening more to the private sector future jobs than their current elected/appointed one. The solution is far simpler (if not easy), it involves an active, educated electorate that votes out politicians who seem more in bed with corporate interests than their constituents.
Having people in government who have reason and means to create rules for our country that benefit corporations over the people seems like a threat to democracy to me.
