Sen. Bernie Sanders has called out Warren Buffett for making billions of dollars, while rail employees are fighting for paid sick leave and better working conditions.
"In one day, Mr. Buffett made twice as much money as it would cost to guarantee 15 paid sick days a year to every rail worker in America," the Vermont senator said. "The greed of the rail industry must end.".
US railroads and rail unions have been at loggerheads this year over wages, onerous scheduling, a lack of sick pay, and staffing shortages.‚Äù.
The reason railway workers are pushing for 15 paid sick days is because of the work schedule. I'm on call 24/7 365 days a year. The company can't figure out the lineups for trains, so I never truly know when I'll go to work. The issue with this, is if I have a doctor's appointment on a Wednesday, I may have to lay off on Monday, Tuesday, and then Wednesday just to make that appointment. The company likes to call us, run the trains in a way that I'm gonna work twelve hours or more, and then sit me in a hotel for over 30 hours (my current record is 40 hours in the hotel just waiting on my phone call).
