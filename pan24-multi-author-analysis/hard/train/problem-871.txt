California's laws didn't stop a California resident from committing a mass shooting using a gun bought in California, and that means more federal laws would change anything?
California's laws won't stop anything with federal support because it doesn't address the fundamental issues of why people are going on shooting sprees.
See the problem is, California laws alone are incapable of punishing rural firearms enthusiasts in Wyoming for the crimes of inner city gangbangers in LA. Takes a federal level infringement to pull that off. People shouldn't be able to just move out to the country and do what they want, we need to make it so there is no escaping maximum government control.
Saying the second amendment doesn't apply to modern rifles because it was written in the time of muskets is exactly like saying the first amendment shouldn't apply to speech over the internet since it was written in the time of quill pens. Technology changes, principles do not.
The problem is, most of what's being proposed is far from common sense. Instead it's things like "assault weapons" bans that specifically target the class of firearms used most by enthusiasts and least by criminals. Or "high capacity" magazine limits that actually include the standard magazine sizes for most commonly owned firearms. The whole game of anti gun politicians is basically just making up scary sounding names for completely normal stuff in order to trick the uninformed into thinking it's something bad and unnecessary.
