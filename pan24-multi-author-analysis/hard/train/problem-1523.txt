Honestly I think we as a working class nation should have a national strike. All the grocers, truckers, rail men, everybody deemed essential to this nations economy. We the people are sick and tired of getting punished by rich elites for running this nation.
I don't want someone hauling a million pounds of cargo drowsy from the flu. I want them well rested, well vacationed, and given sick days. Capitalism is so lame.
Oh noo the economy who gives a shit. The railroads would fold in less than a week because the lost profit would exceed the demands in that time.
Also, really what would it last three weeks before the companies gave up had the democrats not decided to crush the guys wanting sick pay stop being so dramatic.
They were supposed to put sick leave in the first bill, send it to the Republicans and say: "pass the compromise, or tank the economy"...
How many Dems voted to break the strike, knowing that they didn't have the votes for paid sick leave? Nah, fuck them for doing this Pontius Pilate hand washing bullshit, the whole government is anti-labor.
