While I agree that she is an utter moron and supported a terrorist regime. She is actually British, and should be tried and imprisoned for her crimes here. She might not deserve that justice, but it certainly should be her right. Especially considering she has been left stateless as a result of being stripped.
She is not rendered stateless, she lost citizenship in her preferred state. That’s a huge difference.
She isn’t arbitrarily being deprived of UK citizenship. She has been documented committing and admitted to engaged in criminal acts (terrorism). That means under UK law she is subject to having it revoked as she has access and a right to another citizenship, Bangladesh. Despite what you claim this law does not target those who only possess UK citizenship with no right to any other citizenship, so no it doesn’t make someone stateless and cannot be used as such. It also has a right of appeal which she used and lost.
Her argument is that because Bangladesh refuses to admit she is theirs she is rendered effectively stateless by this law which conflicts with UK law that does not allow someone to be rendered stateless. So she feels that despite her activities and support of terrorists she should be free to return to the UK.
So for the people arguing to allow her back, what is her punishment for becoming a terrorist? Jail time? Say she’s gone through enough?
