First rule of business is stop letting people do their own tax returns. The IRS knows what you owe. For the normal person we just put a bunch of numbers into a machine and it spits out a return that the IRS is like: “ok that checks out”. Where billionaires can just claim a bunch of stuff, put in $0.00 and dare the IRS. Make them pay their bill first and challenge the IRS if they think it’s wrong ( legal expenses paid to the IRS of they lose).
The only reason to want your taxes to be private is because you want to pretend you are something you are not.
People who argue that revealing tax returns is embarrassing are telling on themselves. The average person is not evading their taxes. The average person is not getting money from foreign agents. The average person is not running charity scams. etc etc.
Valid. I wonder if there is a middleground of obfuscation of certain details that would allow for some accountability efforts.
Would making them all public and paying out % bounties for catching tax cheats kill freedom somehow? If it is a % bounty the eyes would all be on keeping the top earners honest.
