Turkey has one of the largest and most experienced militaries in Europe, along with a booming domestic military arms sector. Theyâ€™re also geopolitical rivals with Russia and in the best position to block their expanse via the Black Sea. They are invaluable to have on our side. Yes Erdogen sucks ass, but Turkey provides more to the strenh of NATO then most of the states in it.
Denying Sweden entry into NATO is good news for Russia and Erdogan can use it to look strong in his own country.
Because the end goal is not to get what Erdogan wants, the goal is to deny Sweden what they want. That will be the only constant in this story.
Turkey is just doing Russia a solid. All the rest is just window dressing. Sowing discord between NATO allies is basic Russian playbook and Erdogan is on good terms with Putin.
Enough with Erdogan playing politics at the expense of NATO. For playing joker on a matter important to security of organization for its own political gain Turkey need to be put on notice that this time it went too far and there will be repercussion once war in Ukraine is brought to conclusion.
