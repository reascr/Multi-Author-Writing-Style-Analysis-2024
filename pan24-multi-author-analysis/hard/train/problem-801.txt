World fertility rate is only 2.3 children per woman. It drops every year so it gets closer and closer to replacement rate, and then world population drop. This is not just a rich country thing, almost every country is in the world regardless of wealth has had their fertility rate drop over the decades. There's just a few countries that increased their fertility rate.
What do you do when the countries you are sourcing immigrants from start having a declining birth rate? It's not a long term solution.
This has been an issue for a very long time. Japan has a culture that celebrates and expects long working hours, and effectively making your career your life. People are pushed to find high paying jobs, work long hours, and go out drinking with their coworkers after every shift. Assuming they don't work extra hours and crash at a hotel. Japan is in a situation of either make your life yoir career, or have children and not have your life be your career. The issue there is that you get heavily judged as a "burden on society" in the case of the later.
You are literally demonized for deciding you don't want your life to be about your career. This is unsustainable if you want a healthy population size.
What you want is mostly a stable population. Explosive growth is not good, and there's only so many people the world can support, but a shrinking population causes plenty of issues as well.
Another problem is of course that the birth rate is not evenly distributed. Africa stays poor in part because there are too many kids, while Europe and some Asian countries will become poorer because they have too many elderly.
