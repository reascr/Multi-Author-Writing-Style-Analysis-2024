Maybe I just grew up around more guns than most people, but I've seen plenty of guns become worth no more than scrap metal due to general wear and tear, lack of cleaning and maintenance, or just general mistakes. Shit happens.
I mean, if there was a ban on sales of new specific types of guns that number would solve itself. As guns break down, wind up in forgotten garages, etc if they aren't being replenished by new sales the overall number will drop. And as that number drops, the price of the banned guns on the black market skyrockets.
Are... are you serious? You're claiming guns never break? Never get broken? Don't rust? Firing pins don't get stuck?
This conversation is so incredibly generic I'm shocked you'd even try to estimate a time frame. I'm well aware how many guns exist. I'm also aware what a "first step" means.
It's a first step, yes. It's not a complete solution on its own. You seemed to be implying otherwise.
And I'm clarifying for those who aren't aware, that this is not going to be a quick resolution. It would take decades, not years, without other solutions layered on top.
Don't forget, 400,000,000 is a very large number. It will take many decades for prices to "skyrocket." It certainly won't happen over a single term.
