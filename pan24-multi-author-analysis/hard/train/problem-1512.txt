Correct. The postwar US Strategic Bombing survey concluded German industrial capacity wasnâ€™t hurt by the bombings. While the bombs definitely destroyed facilities, Nazi Germany made sure to distribute the location of wartime production and machine toolings to ensure few disruptions from Allied bombing.
Leaving aside the "terror" aspect of bombing civilian targets, at least the carpet bombing of WWII did impact Germany's military industrial capacity, but Ukraine is getting most of its new equipment from outside its borders.
The Russians are just pissing their money away on missiles, and making it harder and harder to ever rebuild their relationship with Ukraine.
If russia were trying to destroy Ukraine's logistics with these strikes, the targets would be things like factories and transport infrastructure. People can point to the power infrastructure attacks but that's really not the ideal way to go about things- militaries can use portable generators, and if you're taking out military industry it's a lot more cost effective to hit factories rather than power stations that can shift load and be repaired/replaced rather quickly, as evidenced by Ukrainians consistently restoring power within days of attacks. Factories are centralized points that can take months or years to restore to operation, depending on the damage.
It could be that Russians are trying to balance this with their own need for population, it could be that most of the refugees entering Russia were from before this strategy was adopted, it could be that the Russians are only taking pro russian refugees. Likely not possible to say with available information.
I don't know the answer to that, but I do know this is the NATO take on Russia's current strategy, as well as many analysts.
While you are correct about that being the strategy in a lot of cases, that's not what Russia is doing in Ukraine. It's not really about breaking civilian morale either, although that is actually pretty close.
