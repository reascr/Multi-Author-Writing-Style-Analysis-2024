Musk let half the staff go when he took over. Since then, about half of the employees left have quit. Do you honestly think that 75% of the employees were not needed and the 25% left are going to be able to deal with any issues that pop up? Not to mention the people who cut paychecks are among the ones who quit Thursday, so we'll see how many of those 25% are willing to keep working when they aren't getting paid anymore.
I used to work in a factory and a new boss came in and told the maintenance guys to stop shutting down one of the chains for maintenance every weekend because it was eating into production time. They told him that was a bad idea but he didn't listen. Then, like you, he claimed that everything was OK because for 2 months everything was fine and that proved the weekly maintenance wasn't needed. But then it broke down and because of no maintenance they had to replace several key components that had failed and instead of the 16 hours of down time that would have happened over those two months the line was down for a week and they had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on replacement parts.
Just because it hasn't broken yet doesn't mean it won't and, when it does, there are serious doubts about if the people they have left are going to be able to handle the issues. It's not a matter of if, but when Twitter is going to crash and how long it will be down.
I know I'm in the minority but Twitter's existence is a positive thing for me and I'm sad that it's going away. I just know how to use it responsibly and stay away from the toxicity.
