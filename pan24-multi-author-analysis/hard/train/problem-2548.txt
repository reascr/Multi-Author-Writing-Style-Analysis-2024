Here’s a link explaining that they’re still importing Russian gas and they’re trying to be self sufficient from Russia for the future.
Because they’re heavily dependent on Russian gas and they’re trying to avoid economic problems because of that.
Not wanting to diminish their own stockpiles in case of war, not wanting to bankroll a production line spin up, not wanting advanced tech to fall in to Russian hands. Could be any of them.
If Russia attacks Germany/Poland it triggers art 5 and deploys all NATO forces. If it didn't escalate to nukes immediately, conventional warfare between NATO and RF forces would take place, why wouldn't Germany want tanks for this possibility?
Tanks in terms of modern warfare will ONLY work in a situation like Ukraine in which massive conventional force against a neighbouring country is possible. If Russia wants to go after Germany, it won't be fought with tanks.
Ahh yes im sure that germany just doesnt want western tech in russian habds, thats probably why they want the us to send other, more advanced, tanks first.
