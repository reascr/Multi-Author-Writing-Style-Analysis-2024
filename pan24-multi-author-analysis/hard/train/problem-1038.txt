Then Biden won and the White Christian Nationalist movement made eradication of trans people their path back into power. They've convinced a substantial portion of the country that we're baby-mutilating pedophile monsters, and that our existence is the product of a "social contagion" infecting healthy, normal (read: cis, normal) young people and turning them into worthless predatory degenerates.
Hell I transitioned 20 years ago. And for a long time it really seemed like things were slowly getting better. But holy fuck it's worse now than when I was a teenager.
They leave the law worded vaguely enough that they can pretend it's impartial, then use it to criminalize queer people's lives.
I think it's a bunch of bullshit how they're treating trans people, just don't think this is a workable angle.
I think trans people are the test case, if it works, all sorts LGBT and women's rights will be removed, obviously women have already lost reproductive rights in Texas.
This fight will probably end up in front of the Supreme Court eventually, and I have very little faith that they are going to rule in favor of trans people's medical rights.
