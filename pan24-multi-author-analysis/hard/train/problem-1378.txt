Also explain to me how Putin surrendering a fight he was certain he would win, let's him save any face at all. He's not getting his territory back and he's not going to be able to end anything without losing more.
The article doesn't even address that part. It states that Ukraine is winning and want's all their territory plus Crimea back but they don't even touch on what happens to all that territory if Russia just end's the conflict.
So the plan is to leave NATO which would "permit Putin to save face if he ended Russiaâ€™s military and political debacle in Ukraine" and what's the plan if he doesn't end it?
I'm not saying that we should pull out of NATO, but I don't think you really understand what their objective is when it comes to Ukraine. Whether Ukraine wins or whether Russia eventually wins but is ruined in the process...we win. If it was really about protecting Ukraine, they would have landed troops.
NATO unity in the support of Ukraine is all we have to confront both of these tyrants. China may not have the military we have but they are a very powerful country. In comparison Russia is just a gas station and the Ukrainians are struggling.
