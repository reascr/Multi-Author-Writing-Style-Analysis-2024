I really wonder how well that will actually work considering how refractive water is. Air and water's refractiveness is much different and with the depth most subs operate at, I wonder if a laser could penetrate thousands of feet into the sea from space.
The green spectrum (532 nm) laser beam from an airborne bathymetric LiDAR system can penetrate up to 300 meters underwater.
There is no laser from space that can deliver enough power that will result in an underwater detection of a submarine.
This is the Chinese testing satellites that can detect submarines. Google "lasers detect submarines" and a number of articles pop up about their research going years back and some about their satellite with this capability. I think they are less concerned with aircraft carriers due to anti ship cruise missiles/ballistic missiles potentially being able to overwhelm their air defenses and sink them.
They have established a fairly advanced set of air bases and air defenses on their artificial island chain in the South China Sea, the biggest threat to their dominance of that region would immediately be US submarines that could launch missiles to destroy those defenses and sink their ships. I don't think we will go to war anytime soon, their air force isn't quiet capable enough yet, but they are definitely getting prepared for a war.
