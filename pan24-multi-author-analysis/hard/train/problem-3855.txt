Pinch of salt, propaganda, fog of war and all that, but pretty much all the analysts have been saying that the Russian losses are horrific.
Fuck war, fuck Russia, Slava Ukraini.. but fuckinâ€™ a someone put an end to this travesty. Not just in Ukraine, all of it. War is a crime against humanity.
On top of all of the other war crimes. I'm not sure this is getting enough attention. Russia/The Soviets, have had a very long tradition of trying to wipe out their own ethnic minorities.
By design I'm afraid. These are either Ukrainians that lived in the areas that Russia took and claimed them as separatists or the undesirables they are trying to cleanse from Mother Russia.
With the Ukrainian and Russians considered brothers and sisters before the war, a Ukrainian come up would have been devastating for Putin. They would have seen the Ukrainians prosper by moving towards the west, as well as become "better" than Russians.
The Russians were more worried about the Ukrainians living standard increasing by their move to the west. They were setup to become a major player economically, once they had a method of extracting hydrocarbon deposits they just found in the eastern part of the country, as well as the deposits in their territory of black sea.
