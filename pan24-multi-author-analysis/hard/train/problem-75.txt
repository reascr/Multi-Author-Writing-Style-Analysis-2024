Exactly thats how you end up with cities voting for the same people type of people all the time. They complain about people shooting up and crime and all kinds of other stuff. But they cant connect the dots that all the policies that allow that to happen are a direct result of the people they vote for.
So in your opinion its all the state legislators fault and the governor and city officials have nothing to do with anything thats wrong with Milwaukee. Ive never been there so I have no idea what may be right or wrong there. But thats pretty interesting.
Actually yes I have.ðŸ™‚ I live in California though so its all blue ðŸ’™ and the cities still suck. They have all those problems I mentioned before and there is no republican legislators to blame.
The House is going to spend the next 2 years passing legislation and then blame the Dems for it not becoming law. Republican voters will hear about this on Fox News and continue to think the Dems are the problem and then continue to vote R.
The election deniers are the Republicans with gravitas within their party. They use McCarthy as a door mat when they enter the Capitol, and McCarthy responds with thank you, sir/ma'am, may I have another?
