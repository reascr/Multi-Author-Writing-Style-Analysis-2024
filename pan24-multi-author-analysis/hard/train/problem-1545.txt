I feel like they panicked and put it all in low risk, which means they didn't recover the way they would have. We lost half our retirement, but tripled back what we'd lost during the Obama years.
My in-laws lost their asses in the 2009 crash. Well over half their retirement. They both went back to work full time. My mother in law is still commuting (a really shitty commute) 3 days a week. At 76. They thought they were all set, but had never switched their high risk investments to lower risk. That's a mistake we won't make! I have zero desire to be working past 60, thanks.
Would I want to work after 70? Perhaps. Maybe I'd do some part time work or volunteering to keep active. However, I wouldn't want work at that age to be "I'd better keep working until I die because otherwise I can't afford to eat.".
In a way. We want to work longer because companies only give us 30 hours a week to avoid paying benefits.
Just because corporations want people to work longer, doesn't mean the people themselves want to work longer.
