That's like saying a boxer isn't weak if he goes up against a child and he manages to barely stay in the fight for 10 rounds.
Not much more than a year ago is a strange way of saying Nov 2019, which was over 3 years ago, during Tump's reign. Macron had good reason to say it at the time.
If NATO is so brain dead, why has Putin been struggling for a year to take Ukraine, when NATO has barely had to lift a finger?
US leaving NATO might be the thing which breaks the camels back and pushes Putin to got to war with Europe. Abandoning your main allies in critical moment of need causing millions to die would forever destroy EU and US relationship.
In current scenario where there is a real threat of direct confrontation with Russia and everyone in Europe is raising their defense spending i don't think that even Trump would consider leaving NATO.
Not really, while that was a point brought up, there were also statements implying some smaller nato members were not worth defending, which obviously was worrying for those on the border with Russia.
