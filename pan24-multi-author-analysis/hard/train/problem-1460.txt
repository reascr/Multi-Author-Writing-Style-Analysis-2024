It's kinda sad how this turned from our last ray of hope to get Maduro out to... well, nothing at all.
Thing is, our worst years were between 2014 and 2016. There's no doubt about that and that coincidentally matches the first years of Maduro's term, sanctions on the country started 2017, so no, sanctions didn't cause our collapse as we had already collapsed for a long time. Lifting the embargo would just take the external investment away. Not like the embargo did anything terrible to us, government doesn't invest on Pdvsa anyway or anything worthwhile so not being able to use our money is better.
Everything you mentioned is fairly recent. USA was never involved against Chávez, or even Maduro until sanctions.
Gotta lift the US sanctions against Venezuela & Cuba. No brainer call. Either they aren’t doing anything to damage those economies so lifting them would have no effect (not the case) or they are indeed damaging those economies & lifting them would ease the suffering of the people just trying to live their lives (the case). If someone is so confident that those economies would fail even without the sanctions then lift them & prove it.
