Feel better dude. The worst I've ever been sick is with the flu. Was way worse than my bout of Covid. If this vaccine pans out, it'll be a really big deal.
A universal vaccine would hopefully work on a pandemic strain - which could happen tonight - and take a lot of the bite out of that.
Sure.. Then we’ll need the Disney flu Vaccine and the HBO flu vaccine and the Amazon Flu Vaccine. You know the BBC will have one. There’s no way it will be just one. That’s not how drug companies work.
It’s lampooning pharmaceutical companies by comparing them to streaming services. As soon as we left single payer(cable)they all started their own services. Pharmaceutical companies are much more interested in treatment than cure, so they prefer multiple drugs to one. Hence the comparison. I do understand that the comparison is weak, IF a single flu vaccine tat could be used Year in and year out were developed, it would be more cost effective for Pharma.
I doubt it will be a one and done, but it would likely be more accurate than the traditional flu vaccines we are using now.
The human body's immune system isn't able to tell the difference between a virus vs a vaccine. It treats it the same.
The mRNA tech allows them to cover more strains at a single time. We understand the flu a lot better now too.
nah its actually better. Vaccine simulate getting ill without most of the side effects of getting ill.
