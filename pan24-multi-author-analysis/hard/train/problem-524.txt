I’m a woman & every time I hear that music blasting from some kids car it’s lyrics about selling drugs, killing women, forcing women into prostitution; beating women up who won’t give him her money - how come a drag Queen performing ‘Gloria’ is offensive but this music talking about killing some 18 yr old girl forced into prostitution isn’t?
The right needs to be forced into confronting people they’re too scared to confront. If they’re going to insist on continuing this nonsense, then I’ll insist they go all the way & include everyone.
This is ALL about their political careers & they couldn’t care less about real people’s lives. I feel as strongly as I do because both my parents are survivors of the Indian Residential Schools & the horrors that went along with those places. Even in their late 70’s they still have not been able to find some sense of safety or community or anything. Those schools made it so Indian children didn’t even trust each other. And so when I see what the right is doing with LGBTQ people I see much the same pattern weaving religion & shame & trying to make their existence just go away. I can tell you from experience that does not work. Whats worse is these politicians KNOW this.
It should be really obvious to most people that this is a political sideshow. I have never been to a drag show, wouldn't know where to go to see one, and really will not be affected in any way by drag shows occurring but this is what the GOP wants to spend their time on.
