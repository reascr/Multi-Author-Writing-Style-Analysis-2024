Turkey properly applied the document that has allowed them to maintain their control over the Dardanelles for the last century. The only thing that's of note is that Turkey has decided that Russia is legally belligerent in a conflict with Ukraine at this time.
So as soon as they for first time announced Russia to be war belligerent, that was it. They are war belligerent, they shall not pass. Except what black sea fleet ships Russia had out in Mediterranean.
They have overseas naval vase in Tarsus, Syria. Probably been chilling out the lot of the time. Not like they have been waiting and waiting to rush in Turkey near immediately declared they would activate Montreux treaty and shut down the Turkish straits to military traffic of the conflict parties Ukraine and Russia, plus well anyone else really sending ships with intend to take part in the conflict.
Any force large enough to simultaneously taken out all the guns before passing, ignoring anti ship missile launchers, would be very noticeable as an invasion force, and would cause turkey to send their fleet there as well as requesting NATO navy support.
Just because you know the position of a whole range of defensive guns doesn't mean you can just take them out, even if you didn't mind declaring war on turkey and NATO while losing a war against another small independent nation.
The point i guess is that Turkey wasn't afraid of Russia, they knew Russia was operating there, they shot down the russian fighter not because they didn't know it was russian, they shot it down because they don't give a fuck if is russian or syrian or whatever.
