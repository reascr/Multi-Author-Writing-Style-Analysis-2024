Reality Winner, Chelsea Manning, Snowden, anyone who fucks with state secrets gets their lives turned upside down real quick. What Trump did was worse than all of them. All the DOJ have done is take back some of what he stole and even gave him his passport back for the inconvenience. It's a disgrace. And I feel sorry for anyone who still believes "ThEse THIngs TaKe TIme...".
The thing is, most of us are tired of the "jUsTiCe tAkEs TiMe" BS. It's not like they're all that successful at building these cases slowly either in the first place. Most of the time they just take forever and quietly hope the public forgets about it. No charge and they don't have to worry about their winning percentage.
What we'd like to see is them actually try. If Garland throws the book at him and tRump walks I'll be disappointed but no worse off than what usually happens with the rich and powerful when they run the clock out and are never punished. At least he'd have been actually charged. It would at least give the impression that they give a fuck.
But COME THE FUCK ON. This dude should have been in jail actual decades ago, well before he even ran for office. Itâ€™s time to stop pussy footing around.
