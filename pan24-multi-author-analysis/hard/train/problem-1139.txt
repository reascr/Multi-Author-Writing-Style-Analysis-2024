While other states like Michigan and Minnesota and Pennsylvania were sending Democrats to the US Senate and flipping state houses in favor of the Democrats, North Carolina got redder.
Extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression, and no citizen ballot initiatives (and a state legislature that will never give that power to the public) are making it pretty permanent in NC and a bunch of other states.
North Carolina has a gerrymandering problem which has made its way to the Supreme Court- the SC that has a Federalist Society favoring majority. This could put We the People's democracy on the chopping block, and if the SC rules in favor of ISL doctrine, states will be harder than ever before to 'flip' despite a majority of votes.
The state level judicial partisanship, particularly around gerrymandering, always seems to favor the GOP. NY for example. Voter turnout has never been more critical, and with Republican party legislative domination in states like NC, it is hard to imagine voters feeling their vote will make a difference.
Now, you could argue that being disheartened by gerrymandering has depressed turnout, but even when turnout was good, as it was in 2020, Dems still lose in North Carolina.
In 2022, turnout in NC by traditionally blue voters (Dems/independents, 18-40 year olds, and urban/suburban) statewide was low enough to give Republicans the advantage. Old North State Politics analyzed the 2022 turnout data and the graphs tell the story very clearly: .
Turnout in NC blue areas was low for 2022 compared to the other states you mentioned. The state isn't getting redder, people just didn't show up. There is a lot of speculation about why that is. Some people think it's because the upper ticket Democratic candidates were uninspiring. I think it might be a little bit of that, plus there was no direct threat to abortion in this election.
