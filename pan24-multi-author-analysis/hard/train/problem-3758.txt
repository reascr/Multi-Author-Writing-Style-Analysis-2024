Modern fighter jets mostly launch missiles. They can be used for air superiority, or for striking ground targets, or for electronics warfare. EG a fighter jet might fly near an area, detect a radar, then launch a missile towards that radar. The fighter jet is mobile. It greatly extends the range of many missiles, compared to launching those same missiles from the ground. Then the fighter jet has a gun as backup, for shooting down drones or dogfighting.
Though it’s an old jet fighter, but still very powerful. Why not to deliver these Tornados to Ukraine @Bundeskanzler?
At another point he asked for F-16s, F-35s, Eurofighters, Tornados, French Rafales and Swedish Gripen jets.
I read Germany has about 90 ready to be decommissioned but capable Tornado fighters being replaced by F-35’s. If they are serviceable capable jets why not send them all to Ukraine at the very least it would save him having to trans get them to the aviation junk yard. NATO will send fighters eventually but to late Scholz will make sure of that dragging his feet and wasting as much time as possible, that man is a total Dick Head.
