“In a win for democracy, democrats win a battle with republicans to let you vote, no matter which party”.
The GOP chooses to see it as a win for Democrats because the more votes that come in the better the Democrats do – because most of our country is Democrat, and Republicans are the minority party.
The reason it says it’s a win for democrats is because it was literally a win for one side of the case, which was the Georgia Democratic Party.
The story at its core is about a Democratic plaintiff and a Republican defendant, the former of whom won. I think it should be up to the reader to draw conclusions about whether that is healthy for democracy. You and I both came to the same conclusion, but it was supported by the same hard facts.
If the reporter got a nice quote from a source mentioning how this is good for democracy, they could’ve used that quote for the headline potentially. Otherwise, it’s best to stick to hard facts and only hard facts.
I mean “win for democracy” is pretty subjective, and journalists, at least the ones that know what they’re doing, avoid subjectivity whenever they can.
That’s not to say it’s not a win for democracy, IMO, it clearly is, but journalists ethically have to keep their biases out of it, even if their bias is pro-democracy.
