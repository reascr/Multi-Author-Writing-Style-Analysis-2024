Not always. Many PR systems are actually mixed-member systems so a district rep still exists in addition to the at-large members but there are other countries using party-list PR where there are no geographic districts.
For some pure PR systems, they donâ€™t have geographic districts at all and allow constituents to contact any representative.
A caution on undoing gerrymandering completely: if you had 100% competitive districts, you could end up in a situation where one party wins every single seat and could potentially do so by razor thin margins in every district giving you a hypothetical where a party wins 50.01% of the vote and has 100% of the seats.
Dems are around 30-35 of the vote in most races and there are 0 dems (2 senators, 4 house reps) elected, the main democratic area has been cracked into 3 60/40 conservative districts to neutralize the democratic voters.
It was extremely effective in 2012 (based on the 2010 Census and the gerrymandering done from that), and got republicans a 33 seat lead even though democrats received 1 million more votes overall than republicans did.
Reminder: gerrymandering is a fundamental Republican platform, called Project Redmap, where Republican Party paid 30 million dollar to gerrymander in 2010 to elect republicans no matter what the vote was.
A huge point that everyone needs to know is that gerrymandering is a fundamental foundation of the Republican Party, it is literally called "Project RedMap", it is in their party documents, developed by the Republican State Leadership Committee, and the Republican Party spent 30 million dollars initially to start the project.
