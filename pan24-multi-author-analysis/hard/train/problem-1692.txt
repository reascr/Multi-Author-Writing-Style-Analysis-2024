It seems Fox is complaining about the support going to Ukraine, that we are against Russia, and that we aren't sending equipment quick enough to defeat Russia.
Even if it's just a Ukrainian feint, if the Russian lines collapse in the south, they can always change their plans and turn their feint into a proper offensive.
I think what I expect is that Ukraine makes some kind of move in the South that threatens to collapse the Russian lines. It might be a real offensive, or it might just be to force Russia to re-distribute their forces to prevent them from being able to pull off a successful attack of their own.
Right now the Russians are desperately trying to support these infantry pushes, which means they aren't displacing as often or quickly as they should, making them easier targets. Ukraine is killing the slow crews first, the others will (re)learn and adapt, at least for a bit.
really they should be defending in the places where they can kill the most Russians while losing the fewest Ukrainians. If that's Bakhmut then they should stay in Bakhmut.
