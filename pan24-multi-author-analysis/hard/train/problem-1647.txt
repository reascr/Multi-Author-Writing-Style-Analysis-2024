Russians have amassed huge numbers in preparation for a spring offensive. Ukrainians have spent the last 6 months training with western countries and theyâ€™ve salvaged a shit ton of Russian weaponry left behind. This is going to be a bloodbath and will probably define the wars outcome.
A bloodbath for both sides. And you may not have been paying close enough attention. But the Ukrainians are very much clamoring for more ammunition, artillery and tank rounds because they are starting to run low. And the sheer volume of soldiers rush it is sending at them is making gains and they still haven't committed the huge concentrations that they are planning to do. The offensive has been getting going over the last 2 weeks.
People need to lose this delusion that Ukraine is somehow in control of this war and on a winning path. Russia fully plans on taking as long as it takes. And they're getting supplied by Iran and North Korea. They're building out new weaponry plants. And don't be surprised if in a year China starts supplying them. And that will be catastrophically bad for Ukraine. Which is why we need to give maximum support now so that the Ukrainians can smash Russia while they are still in a weak and disorganized state and force them to the negotiating table.
He's pushing so hard on taking Ukraine because he knows his grip on power is reliant on delivering, as failure is weakness and weakness is unacceptable.
Russia values strenh. If he falters, which he already looks like he's going to falter trying to take Ukraine, he's ripe to be overthrown by someone, like a Prigozhin. His successor might be worse than him though, that's a risk that's very possible.
This is very likely worse case beyond any of his projections. NATO united immediately and clamped down hard. Swift was the threatened doomsday punishment and it happened week 1. China started falling apart and could not afford to alienate the west. Zelensky did not run and galvanized his country.
