Say what you will about North Korea, but history clearly shows that horrible things have been done to the Korean people regardless of which side of the 38th parallel one finds oneself.
Well… North Korea is plenty Bad, but that’s no reason to believe every story that comes out about them no matter how wacky or insane.
Safe bet for the future: everything you read about North Korea is by definition, unconfirmed tabloid nonsense.
The irony here is that the people who believe this probably also believe that he had his girlfriend killed a few years ago, which made headlines and was never retracted... the same girlfriend that he married and is very much alive, hence this post. The shit that people believe about North Korea is straight out of 1984. People will simultaneously believe three different "North Korea haircut laws", because "LOL North Korea be crazy" not because, you know, you're reading tabloid nonsense.
I don't think it is necessarily CIA or anything like that, but there is a long history of crazy stories coming out of North Korea told by escapees or South Korean dissidents that turn out to be completely untrue, but lots of people believe them because "Hey, North Korea is crazy right?".
While some are hard to disprove, others (such as that one that went viral a few years ago about Kim Jong Un killing his uncle by setting a pack of dogs on him) was from a satirical website but became repeated so much that most people believe it was real now.
Personally I think spreading the false crazy stories is a problem as it makes the nasty stories that are actually true seem much more tame, and less likely to be spread as much despite being more important.
