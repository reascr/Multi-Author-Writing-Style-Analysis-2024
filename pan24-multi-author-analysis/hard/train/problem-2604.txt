The Kremlin's point of view which is presented in this article is - once again - complete and obvious nonsense.
And as a matter of fact, Russia itself has proven on February 24, 2022 that the fears of Ukraine and the West about more Russian aggression, more land grabbing, more annexations were totally justified.
As a matter of fact, it was Russia starting the conflict in 2014 by violating the sovereignty of Ukraine and forcefully invading Crimea.
Russia is in the UN you absolute dingus, and Ukraine was voluntarily trying to join NATO before they got fucking invaded by Russia but go off about how this is America’s fault.
Also honestly if even if they did (which no of course not that’s clearly nonsense) the fact that the Russian government agreed to start a war on behalf of American companies makes them look a lot worse than anyone else.
I don't disagree with the assertion here, just that true or not, it doesn't matter as it worked well enough for the Russians to commit and is an underlying premise for their war effort.
