Yeah I dropped Elon after he tried to do a twitter poll suggesting Ukraine cede its territory. Turning off starlink in the middle of the Kherson offensive, removing the ability for Ukranian users to join twitter. This motherfucker is playing with peoples lives at this point.
Solid point, doesn't stop the fact that your favorite billionaire is a hypocrite that doesn't give a flying fuck about free speech like everyone claims he does. Lets ban everyone that doesn't like him and anyone that doesn't fit his political agenda. You guys are loony toons.
One of the largest communications platforms ever and the new owner is all about "Free speech" is currently trying to suppress free speech of a nation that's being invaded by Ruzzia. He'd go to Hague over treason at this point.
You have no idea what war crimes are or where treason is tried. If intentional, not providing Twitter service in Ukraine is really dumb, but not treason or a crime, let alone a war crime. Good luck naming a single US law he would be breaking by doing it. And even if it was treason (which itâ€™s not) that would be tried in the US, not The Hague.
