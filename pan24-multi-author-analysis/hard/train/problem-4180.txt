Russia's next strategy: Overwhelm Ukraine by throwing bodies into the grinder until Ukraine simply runs out. So much death and suffering just to appease the delusional whims of a madman who has murdered his way into Russian leadership.
Also keep in mind that a lot of russian invaders who are dying over the last few months are literally prisoners charged for rape and/or murder.
Some of them seem like they were fine people in life, but most are either brainwashed folk who went to militarized schools or even just straight-up radical nationalists who hate every nation except mother russia and find joy in trying to kill Ukrainians.
What I think Russia is doing regarding supplanting Ukrainian children and forcing Russians into Ukrainian towns/villages to start living there is brutal. I’m concerned they keep this war going until the west loses interest and we have a indecipherable mix of Russians and Ukrainians living together in Ukraine with a ongoing “civil war”.
The losses are great for Ukraine and bad for Russia, but as long as Putin is in charge, the war will go on needlessly for a long time unfortunately.
Russia is not like the US where 1 US soldier dies and everyone is demanding answers as to why and how the military could let that happen. Russia would gladly sacrifice all of its population to ensure any type of “victory” for the government.
