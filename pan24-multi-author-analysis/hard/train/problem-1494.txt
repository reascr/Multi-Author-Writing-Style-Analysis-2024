Imagine that Hitler's own personal secretary, , was never charged with a single crime, despite everyone knowing she was Hitler's personal secretary...
No, but its reasonable to assume that once said person had first-hand knowledge of atrocities that the nazi party was committing and were not publicizing, quitting maybe was not an option. Do you really think the nazis are gonna let someone with this kind of knowledge of sensitive state secrets just waltz away back into civilian life?
"As for standing up for nazi's when under 21, my grandfather lied about his age at 16 and joined the navy. A lot of soldiers in WW2 were under 21. So yeah, some people did stand up to Nazi's before they were 21. ".
. Further it assumes that a 19 year old would comprehend the actual facts and implications BEFORE going to work at a camp. Thats a bit absurd since 19 year olds today have no real clue about how things work in the real world....and would have even less of a clue without any sort of social media feed.
