Social media has really removed most kinds of nuance in favor of ingroup buzzwords and catchy or emotion inducing titles.
The difference is that most people(hopefully) can at least tell that they are low effort arguments even if they agree with the sentiment, and if you CAN counter them they fall apart pretty fast.
The reason I brought up the ones I did is they are more labor intensive to argue against, and are often used in conspiracy groups, which the article is referencing.
The whole vaccine debate is filled to the brim with these kinds of junk science populists, misleading claims, out of context statistics, and straight up lies and has been this way for several decades. When you thoroughly debunk one thing, either people don't read the counter arguments, or they just make up something else and move to the next thing.
I honestly feel like most of the misinformation out there doesn't even refer to research. It's just a bunch of weird claims that make references to "common sense", as if that explains everything.
