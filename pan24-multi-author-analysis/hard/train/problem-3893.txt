I did this in 2008 for Obama in Philadelphia after driving there from San Diego. If you want to help out in a swing state where you can’t technically vote, you can still make a difference.
We must call up anyone we can think of that isn’t an active midterm voter and rationalize with them. Maybe they don’t care for any candidates now but unless they vote tomorrow, they won’t get another chance.
Votes aren't counted until after the polls close tomorrow (in most states). If a state does allow votes to be counted before polling closes, results won't be published until that happens.
Yeah, that won't happen. Polls need to close and then votes will be reported by each voting precinct to their respective secretary of state who then reports updated numbers.
Got'cha, I'm up there too. I don't blame you for not watching election coverage, not many people do. I don't know a single person who does aside from myself, and I know a fuck load of people.
Enjoy the shitshow. Republicans will declare victory because their tiny counties with 500 people have reported their numbers in the first hour whereas cities that have a million votes to count takes through the night.
