Loving all the people thinking NORAD didn't see it before it even got to the Aleutians. Imagine the public outcry if either Canada or the US decided blowing things up in the stratosphere was a good idea, spy craft or not.
I really struggle to guess what a spy ballon could be gathering that spy satellites wouldn’t. Maybe some signal intelligence, but I would assume all the important stuff would be encrypted.
IDK, if there’s one thing that the US seems to excel at, is fighting a near peer in both kinetic warfare and traditional intelligence gathering.
What if the DoD and US intel communities actually know what they are doing when they recommended not shooting it down?
If I was the head of US information warfare, I'd make sure all the public statements conclude with "while alarming, this is not unusual activity. The US has conducted many such flights over China in the past month.".
Oh they are definitely going to try to capture it. I'd love to be on the team coming up with ideas for that. I'd say float a tethered balloon out the back of a C130 and try to get it tangled up.
What's to understand? They sanction Australian wine because they are fragile piss babies who can't even handle another country having a free press. And they wonder why everyone is suspicious of them.
