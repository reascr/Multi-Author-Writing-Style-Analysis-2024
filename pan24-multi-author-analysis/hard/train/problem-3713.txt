Putin has to be severely desperate with the way oil prices are going. They were expecting a vastly different situation for 2023 and are getting absolutely annihilated on the front lines.
It's not a mystery why they have been trying to push Ukraine to 'let them win' through negotiations recently.
Russia's condition for talks in the first place presumes the Ukraine to admit some sort of defeat, as things are far from static, no?
But, if that is the benchmark to look for, Ukraine can merrily liberate Crimea, and Russia will have to accept the loss of territories for talks...
Not to mention Ukraine is damn smart for not accepting any ceasefires or "peace talks" unless Russia leaves the country. All Russia wants is time to get their troops rearmed before the talks will mysteriously fall apart and a renewed offensive starts.
Very true. The amount of times Russia's narritive has shifted for this war I can easily see them start acting like they're just trying to defend their "own" territory from the never ending onslaught of "NATO backed Nazis.".
Yeah. I think Muscovy needs their Antietam or Gettysburg-type loss to finally accept defeat. I think Ukraine is again producing another such moment at Bakhmut, and also gave Putin Khan a chance at Kherson city, Kharkiv city, and Kyiv. It's shitty in this case but some people need a few hard lessons before reality sinks in.
