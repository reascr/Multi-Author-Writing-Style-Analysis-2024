Again, this is unconfirmed, source is Israeli TV channel 12 1 hour ago, waiting for TimesofIsrael or Jpost to publish something about it so I can post it as well, but ill add it here for now.
From what I understand it's most likely Mossad agents that came into Iran, possibly from azerbaijan and conducted the strikes from within.
Iran and Israel have been in a shadow war since the Islamic revolution hit Iran in the late 70's. They've maintained a stance of Israeli eradication since then and Iran revolutionary guard have been seen operating with Hezbollah and their arms frequently make it to Hamas as well.
Something worth noting is that Israel really has no good defence against Iranian ballistic missiles. The iron dome can't intercept missiles travelling at the speed Iran's would be by the time they arrive.
My point was that it isn't as simple as "Iran would get stomped" as if they have no capcity to retaliate. They very much do. Both Iran and Israel should be cautious here.
And despite all, we know Israel would get further help from USA anyway, even if they can handle Iran with their own strenght.
