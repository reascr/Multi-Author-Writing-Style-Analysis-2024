Sadly, when they refuse to pass a debt ceiling raise that the Senate can pass, we may just wreck the global economy enough that they'll get to burn the place down on their way out.
Not if, when, and anything they do has to go through the Senate and Biden, this is gonna be tense, and these neo-far right folks are about to get a lesson in why not to screw around with debt ceiling.
Biden just needs to come out and say he's directing whatever legal entity is responsible to look into simply ignoring the debt ceiling. Don't let the GOP play this stupid game. Spin it as actually trying to govern, and still pay for things that affect people, while the GOP are willing to cut payments to programs "you" use.
6) They're customizing the list of spending that they will allow through the House to what will keep their insipid voters voting for them.
2) They can blame Biden as the economy tanks and doesn't have enough time to recover before the 2024 election season.
They don't care about the suffering that it will cause to the most vulnerable in the US. They are fulfilling the Reaganite wetdream.
