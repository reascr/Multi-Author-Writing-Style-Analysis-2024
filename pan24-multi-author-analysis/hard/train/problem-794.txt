I agree they have things that we can't even imagine. I'm just saying the 6th generation will not be ready for 10-15 years. Even if it's done they spent 1 trillion developing the 5th generation they need to sell as many as possible before they release the next.
There is no point in rushing a 6th generation fighter to market as there is nothing to even compete with the f35 so why compete with yourself? They need to sell as many 5th generations as possible before announcing the next is ready. For all we know the 6th generation might be a flightless AI fighter. Technology moves fast and if you don't think the u.s. military has secret technology you're delusional. Also the b2 is not a fighter jet they play different roles.
Yes, the F-35 can kick the ass of every other small plane out there (just not the F22 which is larger and more expensive). But if they ran with several cheaper, and faster to deliver projects (an F16 replacement, an F14 replacement, etc, and maybe some requirement that a helmet and computers can be used in all of them) they might be ready to have 6th gen fighters ready to roll out now.
This is still true, hopefully they end up gluing together fighters to get the double engine configuration we need, so we actually only purchased 44 F-70's.
The F35 has parts support from all over the world and operating costs keep dropping dramatically, buying an F35 practically guarantees that you end up with a plane that can be maintained and ready to fly quickly when you actually need it, which is the whole point of buying a Fighter.
The F35 is superior in every way that actually matters, even if the US wanted to the production line is in deep storage in the Sierra Army Depot and most of the equipment has rotted away or is so out of date that you'd effectively be redeveloping a 20 year old fighter.
F18E, which is the budget option but would leave them in the same place in 15 years with having outdated planes.
