That's not use of force... Use of force would be someone physically showing up and taking their money from them or their bank. The reason these companies generally respect the government/legal system is because the government holds the greatest forces in the country - the military and the police. Law is just words backed by the threat of that force.
Unstable nations generally arise from a situation where the government's legitimacy given to it by its force is threatened by another force within or outside of the country. That could be an armed rebellion (revolution) or a challenging alternate "government" (like the Taliban in Afghanistan) or it could be an invading country (like Russia in Ukraine). In all those cases a potentially stronger force is threatening the monopoly on power held by the government.
The only reason why the legal system has any power is because the government has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. You can't create your own private police force to repossess stuff in your insurance provider's office unless the govt lets you.
