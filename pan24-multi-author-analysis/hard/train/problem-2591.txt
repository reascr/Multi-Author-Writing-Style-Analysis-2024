And now he gets to be the sacrificial lamb for the elites. The conspiracies they scream about are done by them, LOL.
Fuck the hate, the conspiracies, the defamation. Biden has a soul. He is a father who loves his children, who pushes for their success and cares for them. Despite hardships he understands what it means to be in it, to struggle, to not know what to do but still know that we have to try something. He knows when to ask for help, and has the decorum and integrity to not try and gloat or shit on his opponents unless they come for him doggedly... or are truly despicable and enemies of American life.
Because he's actually trying to fix problems not stand around with his thumb up his ass pointing fingers and trying to manufacture fake outrage to appear to be doing something ...ahem republicans.
It's more that he's willing to sell out everything the left flank of the party wants and stuff bills full of appeasement for Republicans and remove everything they have real objections to.
It's because most of that "stuff" was very limited in reach, purely symbolic (like a "mass pardon" that frees exactly zero people), had no chance of getting past the courts (student loans justified under the weaker of the 2 available legal theories), seriously overrated handouts to big businesses that didn't need it (chip bill), or actually a net negative after all the good parts were stripped out (BIF).
And he's done a few things that are downright appalling, like appointing an avowed enemy of due process to turn college Title IX procedures back into an Orwellian nightmare, having learned absolutely nothing from his own false accusation.
There's been some bright spots, like how well he's done with helping Ukraine, but it's very underwhelming and it's hard for people to not focus on the blatant betrayals like the BBB and the union busting, and the things he could be doing but won't like directing the AG to deschedule pot or at least move it to C-V.
