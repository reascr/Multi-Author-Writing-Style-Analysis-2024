India likely figured that they could get a very good deal on all the R&D Russia has done for this stillbirth of a tank and developed their own model much cheaper and faster than they otherwise would have been able to. With a little luck they can even export the result to countries that would no longer want to buy Russian now.
The whole business relied on being able to sell tanks aboard in order to make some for Russia itself. Now the whole tanks made in Russia thing is no longer a thing anyone wants and they are left with a tank that is really good on paper, but doesn't really exist in real life.
The R&D is very expensive for a advanced tank, looks like not even russia can afford and the original plan of export didnt work, so now they collab with India?
Remember when Russia sent T-90MS to Ukraine that were built and paid for by India, instead of fixing them per their contract?
i would say india would be fucking stupid to accept the russians help with tank building thanks to the ukrainian war.
as for the ukraine situation, well of course doctrine will play a major part, theyre on equal footing.
