Protests tend to can lead to either revolutions or civil wars if the reasons for the protest aren't sufficiently addressed. But those two options only arise if a protest can't be crushed by the ruling authority. It's starting to look like this protest can't be crushed by the ruling authority.
Protests TEND to lead to repression for the most part. Very few protests actually succeed. But they CAN lead to war for power in the right circumstances.
Generally those circumstances are that some level of the elite sees the opportunity to get more power for themselves . That can be business elites, or government, or military. But generally the people alone aren't going to overturn an entrenched dictator.
One thing that modern autocracies have gotten very good at is weeding out the malcontents among the elites so that there is no real power center OTHER than the leader.
It weakens other things (see the Russian military for example), but it keeps the autocrat in power when the people inevitably get rowdy.
