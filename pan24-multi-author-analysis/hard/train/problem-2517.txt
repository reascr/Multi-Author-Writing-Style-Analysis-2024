The top 1 % pay more than 40% of the income tax in this country. It’s depressing to me that most people don’t know that. Let me say it another way.. the top 1% pay more than the bottom 90% combined. How exactly is that giving them a pass?
You’re depressed that more people don’t know about taxes. I’m not being snarky here..genuinely curious.. Did you know the rich paid so much of the income tax?
Let's say it another way... Who here is stupid enough to believe that the multimillionaires and billionaires pay what they do in taxes instead of being poor and middle class because they are too stupid to give it away?
And then add in the tropes that republicans seem to believe in like giving rich people/corporations tax breaks will trickle down.
It's a good point, but republicans repealing tax cuts for the ultra wealthy will be the last thing they ever do. They would sooner jump around praising transkids winning olympic medals, celebrating MLK day, and/or confess that their public venmo transactions should be sufficient evidence for going to jail.
