As a federal employee I am allowed to accept unsolicited gifts of $20 or less per occasion and no more than $50 a year.
As a bank employee, I can gift $20 to a federal employee if I spend the necessary few weeks filling forms, get manager and legal approval and can justify a special occasion.
Fed workers (at least at the normal level) can accept, cumulative, $50 worth of gifts in a year… it’s those in the upper echelon (appointed judges, congressional reps, etc.) who can make their living off of bribes….
That sounds like a good idea except they would just go even harder on the bribery if that happened. Like it would make it official. What we need is to require extremely invasive audits of their finances and massive penalties for any lies or omissions. And it all needs to be public - we need to know who is buying off our representatives.
All gifts to the POTUS are supposed to go to a museum. The president is not allowed to take gifts. Trump pretended to follow that but just kept them instead.
We know for a fact that the Saudis rented 500 nights at Mar-a-lago at inflated prices and never used a single one. That was just blatant bribery, and it barely made the headlines thanks to Trump's constant circus of distractions.
