Need to liberalize zoning and ensure that there are enough construction workers in the influx. Immigration isn’t an issue unless there are inherent shortages.
The only problem is housing. Liberalize zoning and there’s no limit to how many people Canada can hold (maybe a billion, but still that’s improbable).
That's kinda my point for housing and if you look at the rest of the world yes Canadian health care is better but every system has its limits and the strain will start to be seen as these numbers increase.
Yea this is not a good thing, Canada seems to be having some serious housing and healthcare issues. This is only going to make things worse for the country. The only ones who will profit from this are businesses trying to keep wages lower and housing prices high.
From my understanding, it's more of a bed issue in most of Canada where there is not enough room to treat people with the current amount of facilities available. Sure, staffing is good, but more would need to be created and that takes time, especially for a modern hospital. Not to mention paying for all of that and putting the burden of that tax on the current residents. And let's be honest if they are going to due a building boom in any area the houses will not be affordable and average home prices will increase even more.
