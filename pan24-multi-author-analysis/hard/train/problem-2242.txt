I would have to guess it'll depend on how they organize afterwards. A lot of the equipment will also have gone through a tough war and most is older stuff. Probably a lot will be scrapped, some might be returned if working and still used in those countries inventories. It'll take a long time since I'm sure they'll want to reduce equipment variety and restart their own arms industry again.
Lastly, the post war military likely wonâ€™t want 10 kinds of tanks etc. So that may factor into things.
Also Ukraine does have a history of selling off surplus equipment, so destruction or giving back equipment may be part of economic grants used to help rebuild.
I believe a lot of countries are using the aid to Ukraine also as a way to offload dated or overstocked equipment. Essentially, the donation to Ukraine is a good excuse to replace them with newer systems.
For example, Germany is in the process of replacing its Marders with a new IFV called the Puma. Hence why they are willing to donate the Marders.
I mean the replacement/upgrade program of the Caesar was announced already 5 days before the actual invasion started. I do think the whole program got hurried along at a greater pace since then to make these donations possible though.
