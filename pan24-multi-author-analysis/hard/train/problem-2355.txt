The blustering is not for NATO. It’s for the Russian people so they can go “see…we told em Look how strong we are” NATO knows it’s just grandstanding bullshit.
So when they say "we will attack NATO", it translates from modern Russian as "we are scared shitless and we won't attack NATO".
Well if NATO were intending a ‘total war’ with Russia, then I would have to say that they are doing a really, really bad job of it !
If Russia attacks NATO the war will end with an American flag flying over the ruins of the Kremlin.
When Russia loses the war in Ukraine, Putin and his cronies will likely still be in power, and the Russian Federation will likely still be intact.
Edit: As many commentators have pointed out, yes Nuclear weapons exist. Should war between NATO and Russia break out, it is all but guaranteed they will be used. The damage will be massive and billions will likely die.
I do NOT want war with Russia. It would be bad for all sides. My point was, that even with nukes, Russia can not win. Attacking NATO will be there demise even if they take a lot of us with them.
