I should have been clearer. My point was that the majority of the obese population doesn't have a medical reason to use something like Wegovy, not that it would be a permanent solution.
For the percentage of obese people who do not fall into that group, this drug would be appropriate. In other words, it shouldn't be used as a lifestyle drug.
No. I do not think that obesity is necessarily the result of an underlying condition. Many obese people could address their weight through a permanent change in diet and regular exercise.
long term weight loss just isn't really a thing, obesity is basically permanent without medical help. you can look up studies on it, no matter how much weight a person loses, it's almost guaranteed that they will regain it.
right, so you're misinformed. obesity is the condition. virtually nobody does fall into that group. less than 1% of obese people ever reach a healthy weight again, and almost all of those who do regain it within 5-10 years. it just doesn't work, obesity is permanent without treatments like these.
