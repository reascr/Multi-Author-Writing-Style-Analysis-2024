In this case, she believes that gay people are groomers. It's something she can prove is a real opinion of hers, and there's plenty of examples she could cite to prove this. A person isn't held accountable for their ignorance in this kind of case.
Expressing an opinion is protected speech in most cases, and someone can't sue and win for libel/slander or defamation of character. Repeated attempts with malicious intent could possibly bolster a case, but it'd still be a hard sell under the law. If there are repeated attempts at asserting this claim, it's possible that harassment could come into play, but a single instance is unlikely to go that far.
I had hoped that with gay rights laws we'd see this kind of thing go away into irrelevance, but it seems like it's come back with a vengance. If this particular line of reasoning by the republicans falls out of favor, like hating on LGBTQ+ did for a while, then they'll just find another group to go after.
It's not right, but the republican party isn't concerned about quelling the idea, they're more interested in using it to gain support for their own agendas....one of which is criminalizing LGBTQ+ existence.
Also went on about how this isn’t political and the leftist need to stop trying to make it political, even though he spouts hate against the lgbt+ community like people aren’t taking it seriously….
What we need to do is start screaming groomer at her and all the other conservative stochastic terrorists until their latest buzzword loses its power as a call to arms to murder LGBTQ+ people.
Because the right has turned it into a hate buzzword they now apply to every member of the LGBTQ community to further their hateful narrative. They’ve changed its meaning among their base.
