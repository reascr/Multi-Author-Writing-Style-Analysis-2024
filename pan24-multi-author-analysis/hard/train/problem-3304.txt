It’s purely for domestic consumption. He knows full and well that the rest of the world will not buy that line of bullshit. If Russia uses nukes, the West will likely respond with overwhelming conventional force and nobody, not even China, will come to the aid of Russia.
Where the conflict arises is among countries who enable Russia but still want assistance from NATO countries for one reason or another. They know who they are, and get seriously butthurt on this sub when mentioned, so I’ll leave the names out. But I think NATO countries should look at this as an instructive moment in the future when thinking about who to assist and with what.
To some extent that’s fair. NATO doesn’t care about every conflict around the world because not all impact NATOs interests. So why should the rest of the world care about this?
Neither the Afghanistan or Iraq invasions were intended to help either country. No matter whose narrative you believe, the casus belli were related to US national interests or security.
Not the entire world. Most of the world seems to be indifferent to this because it doesn’t affect them.
