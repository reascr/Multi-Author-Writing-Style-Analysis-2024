That’s it. It doesn’t matter how fucked up Egypt is, people want to see the pyramids. We learn about them in school, and they’re a constant source of curiosity. They’re one of those things that ends up on a lot of bucket lists. People are going to see the pyramids no matter what’s going on.
You can see pyramids, not the pyramids. Mexican pyramids are cool, but Egyptian pyramids are what’s in everyone’s mind when they think pyramid. We saw them history books, movies, video games, etc. They’re probably the most iconic historical location in the world. There will always been an attraction towards ancient Egypt and the pyramids.
Chances are nearly everyone will have at least heard of the pyramids and can tell you they are in egypt somewhere. Maybe erroneously think they were king tuts but hey they know at least a Pharoah.
Older yes, but go around the world, to like truly anywhere with at least a few years of school, or a tv, and ask people if they've heard of the Egyptian Pyramids... and then ask about New Grange.
Edit: after reading up on it more I'd much rather visit newgrange than the pyramids in person. Egypt seems like a hot mess for even experienced travellers.
Why anyone would travel to Egypt right now is beyond me. I still remember the story from decades ago of a sausage maker in Cairo getting busted for using street dogs to make his sausages which he sold primarily to the high end hotels in Cairo...
