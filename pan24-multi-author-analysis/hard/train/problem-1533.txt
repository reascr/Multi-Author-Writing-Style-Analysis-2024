China would suffer far worse. The money they receive from selling will be devalued to some extent while strenhening the RMB which is a very bad thing for their economy. China invests in US treasuries in part to devalue their own currency.
The US owes money to China in US dollars, not a foreign currency. The US can always print more US dollars to pay back any debts that are denominated in US dollars.
Argentina's problem was that its debts were denominated in foreign currencies (e.g., US dollars, the Euro) and it was expected to pay off its debts in those currencies. However, the Argentinian peso (?) fell sharply relative to those currencies, making it difficult to pay back those loans, hence the default.
Invading another foreign country violates international law, and it could have severe repercussions (see what happened to Russia). If China loses money by lending to Ghana, that is the risk that all creditors take.
You do realise that Ghana turned to China to borrow money is because no one is willing to borrow Ghana based on how bad their credit score is.
Yes, it affects ghanas credit rating but doesn't mean no one will be willing to lend to them ever again.
