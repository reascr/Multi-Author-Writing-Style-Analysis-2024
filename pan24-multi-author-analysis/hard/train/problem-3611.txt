Genuinely, no. I was alive back then. There was no "wide support" in Europe or America for anti-Western, fundamentalist Islamic revolution. It wasn't invented in France or the UK or whatever. That is just a straight-up lie.
Iran's secular authoritarian Western-backed regime was already falling apart in the late 1970s. Some Western strategists may have briefly hoped that Khomeini could restore stability to the country for a few months in 1978 but it is flat-out made up bullshit to take that and claim that "the West caused the Islamic Revolution.".
Yeah. Those spoiled kids would have a hissy fit if they were forced to go back. The world needs to do what was done with russian oligarchs. Sanction them and take away their yachts. Freeze some bank accounts….
It’s a nice thought but pretty sure that would just cause more problems. What Iranian people seem to want is for countries to stop allowing regime members and their families to have sanctuary. The families are spending the people’s money living high lives and regime members are stalking, spying on, harassing and threatening normal Iranians who have fled and their families still in Iran.
If you look at how the regime kids live in the west you can see exactly how much their father’s rule has to with religion. Absolutely zero. Their rule and laws are only about control, power and money.
That's not how dictatorships work. Theocracy is nothing new. there has been countless studies about how they fall and they always will.
Nothing in Iran will ever go back to how it used to be after this. Even if the protests calm down they'll be back the next year and the year after that and they will only get worse. The majority of the country does in fact hate the regime they're just scared under totalitarianism.
These protestests are a huge turning point for Iran because a revolution has started. It may take years to succeed but it has started.
