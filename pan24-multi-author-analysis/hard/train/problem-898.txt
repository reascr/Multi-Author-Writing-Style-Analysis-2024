Doesn’t matter if Biden did the same thing as Trump…..if it’s our understanding that taking classified information and keeping it as a civilian is a crime then Biden committed a crime it doesn’t have to equal Trumps crime.
Does it matter, If Trump never existed do we feel it’s a crime to take classified government documents to keep as a civilian…..if the answer to that is yes it’s a crime, then Biden committed a crime.
This isn’t about Trump really, what I see is a lot of people using Trump as a defense for Biden, as a stand alone incident taking classified information when you leave office is either a crime or it isn’t. If it’s a crime then Biden committed a crime, independent of whether or not Trump committed a crime.
The problem is that this will be used on the right to compare Trump and Biden despite them being unquestionably different levels of crimes.
It's too bad the details and true comparison of how Biden handled this versus how Trump handled his case will be lost to the fanfare of the title of this story.
Thought this article was interesting to see how Biden handles classified documents versus Trump. Not trying to blame or take sides, just an interesting comparison of situations.
