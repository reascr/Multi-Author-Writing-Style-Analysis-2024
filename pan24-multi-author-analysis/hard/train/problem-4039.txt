It's actually more complicated than that. From a theological perspective, sin is like poison to the soul. It makes you worse.
C S Lewis thought that the people in hell weren't locked there. He thought they locked themselves in. He wrote a book called the Great Divorce which is about a bus of people from hell that went to visit heaven and were offered the option to stay. They all chose not to, because of the way they became in life. One guy didn't want charity and wanted some way to earn his stay, and out of principle wouldn't stay for free, for example.
Like if you cheat on your wife, that's a sin. If you lust after another person's wife, that's also a sin. Both of those things warp your relationships and make you a little bit less of a good person. They're habit forming.
I'm not saying that being gay is a sin, or that it makes you a worse person, by the way. I'm just trying to talk about how it's a bit more complicated than "sin is a crime against God".
Sin= a crime against God. Especially if it's on purpose. In worldly terms, a person shouldn't be shunned, thrown in jail, ect for being gay, but to God, you're technically disappointing Him with continuous sin.
So by saying it's a sin but not a crime, he isn't really saying anything specific against gay people, since sin is nothing to be ashamed of in the catholic faith, because everybody sins.
Basically, every human commits sin on a daily basis and so you shouldn't hate someone because they sin differently than you.
There are countless sins that People (Christian or nonChristian, doesnâ€™t matter) commit every day. No one is perfect.
