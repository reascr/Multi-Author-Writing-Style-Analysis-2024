How? I never heard about it. You get paycheck which is lowered by national tax, health tax etc indicated by laws in that country. You go to shop u pay pax on products. How would your home country know how much u earn? Will I learn something today?
Ironically I was born in 80's on the east side of iron curtain and was fed so much US 'propaganda' that I grew up on Disney and his values. Propaganda in paraphrases coz I dont really think showing equality and other, globally accepted as fair, values, to a child is propaganda. And now as an adult, I judge USA, by what uncle Sam hinted brother. I really dont like it. I can do jack shit but I imagine there are few other level headed ppl that wont let it go to total shit. I read short article from other fellow and yes, u can/there r side step regulations.
>The short answer is no, Americans do not have to pay taxes twice. While there is no overall U.S. expat tax exemption, there are exclusions and credits to help alleviate the tax burden for U.S. citizens living abroad.
You can probably side step or skirt the USA taxes living abroad but tax evasion is not treated lightly here.
If you have citizenship in a country you're not currently living in you still have to pay taxes to that country. And the thing about immigration is that it's a multi-year process, many countries even require you to live in their country for years before they allow you citizenship.
