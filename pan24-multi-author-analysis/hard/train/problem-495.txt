Like it or not (I sure don't), George Santos has eclipsed Trump as the Republican ideal, someone who could, with no qualms, steal money donated to treat the dying dog of a disabled veteran. Combine that with the arguably illegal preferences of Matt Gaetz for having a good time, MTG's fascination with space lasers, Boeberts vacuity, and Gosar's family's near universal condemnation of him for being an asshole of the century, and you'd be closer to having a model for the type of Republican who could win the 2024 GQP presidential nomination.
Hogan may be as good as Eisenhower. However, he's a RINO by today's reckoning, so no chance whatsoever of winning the Republican nomination.
Would she make a better president than Trump or DeSantis? Almost certainly, thus she has no chance in Hell of winning the Republican nomination because Republican voters don't want competence, they want MAGA and only MAGA, and Haley has no clue how to deal with that.
Basically, she is a walking bag of ambition who thinks she can be president, not realizing that she's unlikely to win a single primary in today's MAGA GOP.
