Well, not surprising. One of bane of joining EU is you will lose some independence and that can cause clash between member country and EU.
Regardless, there is no mechanism for actually expelling an EU member from the union. Poland would have to come to the decision to leave themselves.
The fact is, no country can make decisions in the EU alone. The EU consists of several institutions, all of which are closely linked. New EU legislation emerges after a process involving all of these institutions. And, of course, European citizens ultimately vote both for their own governments and for Members of the European Parliament.
Or do you mean the President of the EU, appointed by the democraticly elected Council members? I mean no one elects their spokesperson.
Or do you mean the laws voted on/passed by the democraticly elected Members of the European Parliament (MEP)?
You mean the laws drafted by the democraticly elected heads of each country? AKA the European Council? The very laws that have greatly increased Europe's wealth because it removes the red tape on trade and people movement.
