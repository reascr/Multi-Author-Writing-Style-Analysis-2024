Mm. Slavery didn’t happen huh? This is just white supremacy as old as colonialism. Historic facts does not care about your feelings. These kids are not gonna have a fun time having to actually learn history later. And why, random Internet stranger, do you think that your skin color matter?
Studying the errors and criticizing your country for its faults, errors and even rights is exactly what made western education strong. Liberalism is the very fundamental of the democratic ideal - free thought and free opinion even at the expense and perhaps particularly at the expense of nationalist and authoritarians that starts crying “woke education”, “marxist” or “globalist” at things they don’t like. If you would have studied history you would know it’s the exact same things the nazis was saying about education in Germany. And no one gives a f about your skin color - if you think that white supremacy and it’s ideals and thinking only can apply to white people it is painfully clear that people in US needs more education and not less.
And even she could tell Ron DeSantis was a racist weirdo and a scumbag for trying to whitewash history and hated the attempts to gloss over how this country fucked over Black people.
I grasped the concept of my white privilege some time ago but only in recent years have learned how powerful and horrible it is.
There is no such thing as woke ideology. I would have to say that you have somehow been trapped and brainwashed into right wing extremist bs. You need to learn real American history and then follow legit news sources. You have fallen in with the bad side. They hate you. Save yourself and get educated.
For me, as an old white woman educated in the midwest and college educated it was the omissions that I only recently learned about and I am mad as hell that I didnt learn until the past few years.
