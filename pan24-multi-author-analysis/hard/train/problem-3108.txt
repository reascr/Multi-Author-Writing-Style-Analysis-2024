Honestly, I actually think Twitter could've pulled off this idea had they spent months with solid teams doing the research, development and coordinated launch of the new product model. Instead, Elon made all the decisions, fired everyone who disagreed or knew what they were doing, and decided his changes had to be made in 96 hours.
I think that's reductive, but that's beside the point. I'm saying that there was a way that Twitter could have pivoted their advertiser-funded approach toward a more Twitch-like model, but Musk has bungled it.
If there was a way to slip that banana peel under Musk, what would you do to end the tweet storms (and Twitter) masquerading as journalism?
So, is there any endgame here where Musk can profit financially from Twitter's total demise? He has floated bankruptcy, but I don't see how that helps him. The only thing which makes sense, if he is doing this on purpose, is that he is doing the bidding of his stakeholders in burning Twitter to the ground.
If this is not on purpose then we are witnessing one of the greatest humblings of a vaunted business ego, possibly of all time but most certainly since the beginnings of the Great Depression. Even company crashes like Enron, Worldcom, Arther Andersen, and Lehman Brothers didn't have the kind of cult of personality attached to them that Musk has built for himself.
