voting age was lowered to 18 via the 26th amendment in response to kids protestsing being sent to war via the draft in vietnam but not able to vote.
there is \NOTHING\ they can do about the voting age without a new amendment, and that would never ever pass both chambers of the house AND 2/3rds of all 50 states.
Iirc 18 is the voting age as written in the constitution, so they'd need a constitutional ammendment to change that, which i dont see happening any time soon.
Honestly, if they want to raise the voting age, let them have at it, it could set a precedent for us limiting the voting age. Anybody over the age of 75 is disqualified from voting because they are too old. Now that could actually help us create a progressive government.
Democracy works when parties/candidates adjust THEIR policies in order to earn votes. The GOP doesn’t believe they need to earn votes and win over voters. They believe the power should simply be given to them, and they just need to use their power to prevent the people who would vote for their opponents from voting. That’s not democracy; it’s something else pretending to be democracy.
