It's the flipside of the argument that the best way to handle tax cuts is to give it to the poor rather than the rich. Why? The rich often don't change anything or do anything with the increased net income due to the reduction of tax. It just ends up as extra savings. But the poor? They tend to spend it much more quickly, consistently and comprehensively. This puts the money into the system more quickly and more powerfully since it multiplies more.
Well... what is that? That's expansionary pressure. It's often the goal of tax cuts. That's more or less tied to inflation.
Sure, tie it to inflation when it goes up. But what happens after a year with negative inflation? The minimum wage should decrease, but no law will be structured like that--they'd probably just leave the same minimum wage in place, and that could be really bad.
But if "minimum wage" is just an arbitrary number meant to keep a chunk of the population at a suppressed standard of living, then I guess we can just keep on doing what we're doing.
So it does make sense (at least at first glance) to consider increasing minimum wage as of greater consequence to inflation than increasing salaries of upper and middle class folk.
This would actually help inflation because inflation that was a result of price gouging would actually increase the minimum wage. This tying the minimum wage to inflation would create a disincentive for companies to raise prices without justification.
