See, that makes sense too, thanks for a source. Even just knowing a few people who have struggled with housing recently this is so intuitive. With stigma and difficulty I watched multiple people in different states just slip through the cracks because of time. Once that happens they each had negative situations present that cost more kidney to fix than they would have cost to avoid.
Where are these houses though? I mean genuinely asking, I’m not in CA but I do know two homeless people who are and they Al have been qualified for housing since spring, there isn’t availability.
Don't forget homeless people that cease to be homeless get better jobs and have opportunities for education etc.
It's not like the money isn't already being spent, its more a question of how society prefers to spend it's homelessness money.
Then when you say, "ok, fair point, we could spend more money fighting homelessness here" they counter "No, that's socialism".
Ok, fair, it's not always literally homelessness but it's always a "the government could be spending money on _____ instead", but then when you actually agree with them and propose that the government actually do it they flip out.
Yea, idk, but I guess then you have a very serious nimby problem and the fact that some counties and cities would feel they’re bailing out others which is a fairly big deal to reconcile to your taxpayers.
