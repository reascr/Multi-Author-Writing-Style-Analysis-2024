Yeah, we know the parliament was against him and tried unsuccessfuly to impeach him legally. That doesn't negate nor justify the fact Castillo tried a self coup, an extremely illegal power grab, and got legitimately thrown in jail for it.
On to the argument on what is or is not a coup, our previously elected president was ousted by congress in the exact same way as Castillo was and that move has widely been regarded as a coup.
the answer you gave looked like the popularity and the fact of Castillo winning a democratic election was enough to justify his decision to close the congress.
yeah, when the president literally concentrates the power in his person, closes the parlament that was also choose by the people and literally wants to rewrite the entire constitution of the country and other country wants to give asylum to the same guy that wanted to be a dictator the oligarchs are the ones to blame when Peru doesn´t want him to run from justice.
One of Castillo’s main campaign goals and the reason a lot of people voted for him was to reshuffle the corrupt congress and rewrite the constitution to remove clauses that have been damaging our country for so long, such as the Congress’ current ability to impeach presidents based on ‘moral incapacity’ at any given time, which was left vague intentionally and can mean anything at all. This constitution was written by the previous dictator of Peru as well mind you, and has been a hindrance on our country for decades now.
There has to be more to it, look at how his hands are shaking so hard during the video. No one was expecting this and he absolutely knew that he did not have the support to go through with this given the chaos in the Congress and low approval ratings. Something is so off with the current situation. Currently in Lima and there is word spreading that a US official met with Castillo the day before and spoke to him like he was already a former president.
