It’s beyond a reasonable doubt though. Not a shadow of a doubt. Without reasonable doubt means that a reasonable person couldn’t doubt the guilt. For example, the Earth is an oblate spheroid beyond a reasonable doubt, despite the fact that some people believe the Earth is flat. They are not reasonable people.
Again, and this relates to my other comment, they do not need to prove that Trump believed that he didn’t have enough votes. You merely have to prove that a reasonable person couldn’t believe that given the information Trump had at that time.
The problem is that believing crazy conspiracy theories that stroke his ego is kind of Trump's thing. Fortunately for us, lying is Trump's other thing. Much of the trial will center around discerning whether Trump was lying or deluded. Which pretty much sums up what all of us were doing 2016-2020.
I know that, you know that, the world knows that. But the prosecutors have the burden of proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Trump knew that at the time of the phone call. Everyone on the planet knows that Trump is a gullible moron who will believe any bullshit that boosts his ego or serves his purposes, so proving he didn't believe he won will be an uphill battle.
Unfortunately there's also a preponderance of evidence that Trump believes stupid shit in spite of expert advice. If I were Trump's defense attorneys, my closing argument would be "Fauci. Nuking a hurricane. Putin. Bleach injection. Windmills kill birds.".
Well. It’s a bit like asking someone to take money out from a bank vault for you and insisting (lying) that you have an account there when you don’t. The lie doesn’t somehow excuse away the fact you’re just asking someone to steal for you.
