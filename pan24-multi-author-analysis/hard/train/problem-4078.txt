That's why murica is the only cheeky bastard who earns profit from this neighbourhood squabble. lmao you don't even try to hide your powerless and pointless anger for Russia.
Pointless anger for Russia? I wonder if you dig deep if you might find a reason the U.S. doesn't care for Russia. You can start with the 100k dead Ukrainians and cities turned to rubble work your way backward.
Digging deep? We've spent about 50 billion dollars. The U.S. government takes in more that 3.5 trillion dollars a year in taxes. You're going to be outspent by the U.S. and out soldiered by Ukraine. Your forces will never be safe occupying a country against their will. We have eyes everywhere, ears everywhere. Your entire economy that is supporting this war is the size of one of our 50 states. We have no need of your gas or your oil unlike some European countries, we have plenty of each, and a 200 year supply of coal if we need that. We could spend 50 billion a year for the next 50 years arming Ukraine, Putin will be long dead by then.
Zelensky is an international hero and Putin is a pariah. You'll see eventually, it may take a while, but you'll figure it out. Your gas station masquerading as a country will collapse on itself like it did thirty years ago.
