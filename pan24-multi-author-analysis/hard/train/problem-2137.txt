You're overthinking it. Those aren't people who have any great plans. They just want to riot, stick it to the man - and NYE is convenient because there is generally a bit of an anarchist atmosphere, so their debauchery doesn't stand out as much.
In 2020 and 2021 fireworks sales were banned due to COVID. There were fears that additional strain on hospitals due to injuries from fireworks accidents would bring them to the limit.
The most terrible injuries were because of illegal fireworks. The pollution is almost non existent because the smog clears up after a day. The particles of the firework get washed into the soil by rain and are not that harmful. Animals also survive Storms, Thundersturms etc. so something small as man made (especially German cat. II fireworks) are nothing compared to the force of nature. It’s only 3 days a year. Banning firework will get people to buy illegal and more dangerous fireworks from Poland etc.
Soo no one can have fun with fireworks on NYE because some immigrants can’t responsibly deal with fireworks? Why must they ruin everything for the rest of us.
