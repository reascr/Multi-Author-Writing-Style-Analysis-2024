I don’t think holding their feet to the fire will work - they don’t care. (It’s also about controlling sexuality, in spite of abortion being health care).
So antivaxxers leapt onto the argument of "I can't take this shot because it violates my religious beliefs against abortions.".
Yes. I was making the point that this behavior is not going to go away because there is a system of those in service who continue to push this narrative for their own benefit. I have seen the behavior of some service members out in public and it clearly shows they are happy for the worship. They can be confrontational when they don't get it.
As a former service member, you are asking for a miracle. The hero idea is endemic within the service. It is akin to the police force. You're asking for individuals to give up their special treatment card and humbly accept that while the job is unique, it does not make someone special. It is still just a job and trust me when I say, not everyone who puts on the uniform is worth even the paycheck they receive. Sadly, those are usually the ones that demand the praise.
