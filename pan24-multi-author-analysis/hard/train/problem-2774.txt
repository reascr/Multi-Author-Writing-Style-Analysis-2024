That level of certainty requires them to 1. Know what we would use against them in order to avoid it. 2. assumes they are like us where thoughts of weapons are front of mind. A species that comes from a peaceful planet and doesn't participate in violence is unlikely to come prepared to fend off an unknown attack from an unknown species. 3. assumes they didn't send these probes into our atmosphere for the purpose of observing our response.
To say that aliens would be beyond our ability to shoot down requires an understanding of their technology that none of us has.
If aliens are technologically advanced enough to travel the distance, they sure aren't going to let themselves get detected let alone shot down. Part of me wants it to be aliens though. That'll be cool to see lol.
No it's not aliens lol. Extra terrestrial life obviously exists considering the vastness of our universe but there's no logical way they'd have the technology to be able to travel this far and also being vulnerable enough that a human weapon can shoot them down.
People often offer theories about alien species invading to steal our resources, but an alien race capable of interstellar and intergalactic travel, probably has far more resources than we do. If they were here to enslave or subjugate the human race, there would be little pretense for hiding it and it doesn't make a lot of sense to spend decades or centuries "secretly" enslaving humanity by making people think it's okay to be nice to each other, which is an argument the American political right would make and HAS made.
