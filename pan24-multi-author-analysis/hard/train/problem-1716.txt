The democrats weren’t willing to hold the economy hostage for the sake of the rail workers demands, the republicans weren’t willing to vote in support of the rail workers. You’re right of course, but it’s important to appreciate the differences.
Right, but they voted for both bills. It would’ve gotten through if the republicans had voted for it. It would seem the republicans are more at fault because the democrats supported it and the republicans didn’t.
Republicans would have voted it down and blamed the Dems for not letting the negotiations go on. The republicans already said they wanted a 30 day cooling off period. By then republicans would be in power in house. The whole situation was set up and people are going with the republican narrative.
One party actually could have voted for paid sick leave and did not. What you are saying is the republicans agreed with the dems to not vote on paid sick leave and nobody leaked it.
Damn, if those employees are so vital to the economy you'd think the "pro-union" Democrats would give them at least one unpaid sick day.
If the democrats had made it clear from the start that they were not going to intervene then I bet you 100% the railroad companies would have folded and gave the workers the paid sick days. Both parties are shit with regards to this particular topic, no defense of either of them.
