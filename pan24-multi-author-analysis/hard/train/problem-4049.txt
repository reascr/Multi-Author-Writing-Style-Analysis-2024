Orlando's entire economy is built around Disney, the town was like 800 people before Disney moved in. Would be hilarious to see the economy collapse if Disney moved out, but I doubt they will considering how much money is already invested there.
Also, remember that about 2 years ago Disney planned to move the entirety of their Burbank, CA offices to FL, and then DeSantis was such a clown that they cancelled that plan. Disney has the will to do it.
If Disney wants to move it would be a two ir three year payback. Especially since they can operate while they build and attendance numbers would be huge Especially if people knew they were leaving the state.
I wouldn't be so sure. Being a public company, they can establish a plan to relocate, write off the existing parks as a loss and rebuild elsewhere. A small company would have an issue but consider that there are abandoned parks in the Disney world footprint and then consider the cost to build a park is around $1 billion. (EPCOT 1.4B) They already spend hundreds of millions on renovations and building new is arguably cheaper. As park maintenance increases due to age, spending part of thier over 3 Billion profit on a couple new parks with long term state tax incentives starts looking a lot better. (Disney had 3.19B net profit in 2022.).
Yeah. I went to New College and I feel like the whole thing should be getting more attention than it is. Desantis is literally doing a hostile takeover of New College and itâ€™s terrifying.
