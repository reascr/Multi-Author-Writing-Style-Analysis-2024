2) The far more likely, it's to ask if Cuba can supply them with any equipment, including military and medical. Cuba will probably say they're in no position to, and that Russia can't offer them anything substantial in return.
If Cuba is supply military equipment to Russia then it means their military is in a much more dire spot than we realized.
The comment was more of a joke pointing out the embargo and Russia's sanctions(I'm sure everyone here knows that), not that Cuba is currently some rundown shithole with no trade partners.
Cuba has stockpiles of soviet shit out of the 50s and 60s that he's probably hoping to get, so he can send more Russians into Ukraine with junk equipment, where they will die.
The weird thing though is that most Cubas military is horribly outdated stuff from the 1960’s and 70’s that Russia itself should have thousands of units in storage of. It doesn’t make sense to ship this stuff across the world when Russia should be able to pull stuff out of storage nearby and fix it up.
To give an example of the difference in scale here. cubas best tank is the T-62M. Cuba has less than 400 of these in total. Russia has already lost almost 100 T-62/T-64 tanks and plans to modernize 700 more of them. Is Cuba really going to sacrifice half their tank force for Russia? Would that even make a difference for Russia?
