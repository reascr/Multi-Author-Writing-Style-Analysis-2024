There is a somewhat famous book in the Netherlands: "A better environment does not start with you". ().
This is reaction on a campain the goverment started: "a better environment starts with you". The writer obviously does not agree. It's the large companies that need to change. The problem of course being that the companies will not do that unless the goverment forces them to.
Note how the argument is always “who can blame companies? It makes them money!” While simultaneously “individuals are to blame for not changing their lifestyles by using the cheapest stuff consumerism etc.”.
Why do businesses get let off the hook when they dominate the options, but individuals are expected to shoulder the blame when they just react to what actually available?
You think these extremes are bad now? Wait until we blow right past 1.5 C under the excuse of “have to use this shit to keep people warm/cold Not our fault”.
Governments could divert from dirty energy but refuse because the money from entrenched polluters and climate denialists is far too great and persuasive.
