I always thought the people saying "globalists" were a problem were just crazy conspiracy theorists. Maybe their concept of globalists was off but really it is a problem where just a few super rich people will own the world leaving scraps for the rest of us, and it's just becoming more and more evident.
Honestly, while I agree it is indeed caused by globalization, this is just bringing to rich countries what has been happening in poor countries for a long time, where rich citizens from other countries would own a lot of property there. Probably in former colonies.
Maybe not exactly applicable for this case but as an example: free trade agreements signed with third world countries back when most of the trade was the rich country selling the poor country stuff with less taxes, with the promise of increasing the trade in the other direction are finally paying off for the poorer countries. The pendulum swings, letâ€™s see what its equilibrium point is.
Globalization is not just the globalization of the good things is also the globalization of some/many (pick yours) of the bad ones.
