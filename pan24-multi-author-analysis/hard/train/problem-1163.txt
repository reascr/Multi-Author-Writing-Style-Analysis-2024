181 MRAPs is pretty huge. The 190 heavy machine guns with thermal will help a lot with the mass troops rushing forward attacks that Russia has been doing.
If Russia is gearing up for another offensive with 100k+ soldiers, they must be storing huge amounts of food/MREs in warehouses somewhere near the border. Russia may not consider these warehouses as high value targets for the Ukrainians and aren't protecting them with any air defense. I wonder if Ukraine could destroy these with drones.
Seems likely they can/will come up with a counter-drone that shoots down other drones. Now, if they decide to make it look like a warbird of yesteryear… I vote for a P-38 Lightning. Classic!
Awesome! I’m a truck driver. I bet that Ukrainian truck drivers are seriously busting their asses right now. Truck drivers get taken for granted a lot, so I just wanted to look out for them a little.
I hope that Ukraine is being supplied with plenty of heavy-haul low-boy trailers and semi-tractors to go with all of these tracked vehicles that are on the way. Something to consider for all of those countries that want to help but don’t really have spare heavy-weapons, perhaps. Ukraine is a big country, and being able to move the heavy stuff around quickly will be a big help.
