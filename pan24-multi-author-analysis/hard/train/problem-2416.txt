I was living in an apartment on Begbie St. in 2016 and drove/bussed DT everyday for work at the Bay Center. There was plenty of homelessness and camping happening on Pandora during that time, I honestly wouldn't say that our total amount of homelessness has increased much in that time.
I love Victoria, it's an amazing city. I think we could do better to help the unhoused here, but we already do quite a bit, and it's pretty normal for there to exist outdoor urban campsites for unhoused individuals.
That way, the only homeless people on the actual streets would be the ones that are easiest to rehouse (just put them in permanent supportive low income housing). All of the crazy/drug addled ones should be in massively reformed psychiatric care asylums.
If we could do that without hiring a bunch of abusive psychos to watch the crazy people, it would be the most effective way to get the mentally ill homeless people off the streets. Add a separate section to the facility specifically for drug addiction treatment as well.
They need to individually put strict rules onto only the specific individual people who cause problems. They need to stop trying to preemptively stop the problem, because they're fucking terrible at doing it.
