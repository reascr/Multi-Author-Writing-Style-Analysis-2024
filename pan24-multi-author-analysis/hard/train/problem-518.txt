I think most people quietly understand Israel is not on a good path. Sadly hard to talk about it without claims of "antisemitism" even though a religion is not and should never be a country.
You get labeled with antisemitism when you have double standards on Israel that you don't have on other countries. I assume that you are overall pro-democracy and checks and balances. This is 100% a legitimate issue that Israel needs more flack from foreign countries and companies for. Already two mid sized tech companies are leaving Israel due to the democratic backsliding that is happening. Nobody serious in Israel are claiming "antisemitism" over it because it is a pure business tactic. It's best not to be in a non-democratic state. And just as these big tech companies are not in Hungary or Poland, they choose not to be in Israel anymore.
Even most Israelis know this judicial "reform" isn't a good path to be on. Israeli politicians from across the spectrum are voicing concerns about the proposed "reform". Even right wing politicians like Gideon Saar (a lonime Likud member who split off from Netanyahu due to his corruption), Avigdor Lieberman (right wing secular party with ties to Putin), and Benny Gantz (former IDF Chief of Staff) are all speaking out against the breakdown of Israeli democracy if this passes in its current form.
Netyahoo has proven to be a far right war hawk zealot before so Israelis voted him out, now he magically reappears, another trump piece of trash, come on Israel if Americans can evict wannabe dictator criminal Trump from office, the good Israeli can oust criminal Net, if the system is fairly working, and if the system isnâ€™t working, fix it Israel before you drag others in to a war nobody wants.
