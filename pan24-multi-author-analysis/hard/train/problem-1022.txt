I personally see no way to fairly determine who gets and who pays. There are many blacks and whites in this country whose ancestors had nothing at all to do with slavery or Jim Crow. I would support something along the lines of the GI Bill of Rights to pay for education, home loans, business loans to all underprivileged blacks, which could cost more but thatâ€™s ok with me. I strongly support that because it helps blacks and helps the country. Reparation is a con job that does nothing for the country except engender massive resentment by those unfairly forced to pay.
Why should non-blacks whose ancestors suffered war, death, injuries and maiming from fighting for the Union be forced to pay?
None of those ethnic groups were chained and shackled, bought and sold, raped and murdered, and then lynched after they were freed because poor racists couldn't deal with the change.
You can't hold millions of people in race based slavery for 300 years and not draw a straight line to race based poverty in 2022.
Slave ownership is not the only cause of their lack of equity building, our nation's society caused that, and still has in recent years, i.e. not even allowed to obtain a mortgage, insurance on mortgages, ect.
