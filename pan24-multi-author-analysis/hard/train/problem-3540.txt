It's Australia - a place where almost everything you encounter is trying to kill you. One radioactive pill isn't making that place any more dangerous than it already is.
For all intents and purposes, if the radioactive source is removed, the area is safe for humans again.
Yes, neutron radiation can do that. So can energetic alphas if they hit light atoms. Even energetic gammas can crate photo-neutrons.
Radiation is not just gamma rays. It's also for example subatomic particles and nuclei traveling at high speeds. Those can totally make new elements and isotopes, and thus, make things radioactive.
Do you know how Carbon-14 is made in the atmosphere? Do you know what happens to the shielding of a nuclear reactor?
There will be no nuclear explosion, no one is going to die from this. Considering the amount of miles being driven and the number of people driving them I would say the biggest risk is a vehicle accident at this point.
I haven't seen any evidence of a lost logging source harming anyone. There are some pictures out there that purport to be from exposure to logging sources but they are from different incidents with pipeline inspection sources and X ray beams. I don't have all the knowledge in the world about this subject but I did research it to train people and I haven't found any evidence of injuries.
FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES AT ALL TIMES. IF YOU SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE FOUND A RADIOACTIVE SOURCE OR IF YOU HAVE FOUND SOME WEIRD MATERIAL DON'T TOUCH IT AND CONTACT AUTHORITIES.
