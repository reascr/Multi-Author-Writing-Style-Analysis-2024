It was never meant to be justice. She is a Federalist society bot - their judges and supporting judges are put in place to support the conservative federalist cause i.e. electing Republicans and policies. This was a way to NOT demoralize Republican voters directly before the election and/or to prevent more motivation to Democratic voters. We will never be able to accurately quantify but it may have helped them in some close elections. She is just one of the terrible people we will have to deal with because of Trump. She should be impeached.
Rather than impeach her for explicit crimes, it might be faster and better to impeach her for incompetence.
If she were to go on some kind of educational sabbatical, it might not be necessary to impeach. But she clearly shouldn't be attempting to work as a judge under her current conditions.
I think we can all see from her either incompetent or corrupt behavior in this case, that under no circumstances should she _ever_ be a judge in any case of any type. Or at least not until she gets some legal training (e.g. go back to school for a few years).
