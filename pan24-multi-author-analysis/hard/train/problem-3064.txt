While I am happy to have visited India I don’t have asthma and it was still hard on my lungs. I had to borrow my host’s inhaler in Delhi. Kolkata was not as bad when I went. The humidity seemed to help. But Delhi and Agra were rough on my respiratory system straight away. I am sad to say it but if you have asthma I’d advise you to go somewhere else.
Yeah I feel like I might even be downplaying it, since I'm pretty sure my asthma triggers more easily still as of now 4 years later than before the trip. I used to only need my inhaler maybe once a year and around cats, now I gotta keep it with me just in case.
Genuinely, I pride myself as having a pretty iron stomach and like traveling to more remote tiny areas, and had some crazy street food in places like Vietnam, Philippines- but my god I've never been taken out until I went to India.
I did get sick from street Thai coconut once, but I think in general everything in SEA is on a big grill/wok or put to flame and cooked.
I tried some pani puri from a street vendor and he dipped the shells by hand in spiced water. Got wrecked for 1 week from that.
