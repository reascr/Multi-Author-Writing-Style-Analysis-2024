I think the understanding of this topic has gotten incredibly bad, you can legitimately criticize Germany for the extend of reliance on Russian energy, criticizing trading with Russia in general cant be a serious position.
On top criticizing the idea of easing tensions by having Russia rely on revenue from energy sales, as some outlandish delusion just misses the whole point of central European grievance about Germany (not that many of the harshest critics would understand their own contradiction).
If you lack the balls to reign in your own companies trying to increase Russian gas imports to your countries and try to off-load the decision on Germany (stagnating gas use for years and not much actual interest in NS2 beyond the local jobs created) you should not be surprised to be laughed at for the hypocrisy.
"See those massive imports of Russian gas to Germany, making up 20% of all gas imports from Russia to the EU That massive dependence And they totally have no other way of getting their gas!".
This is not true. They are not importing it DIRECTLY from Russia, but they are buying Russian oil from India and China as well at a veeery nice markup.
They aren' buying any directly from Russia. Earlier China was reselling Russian gas because they didn't need all they had and prices were very high.
