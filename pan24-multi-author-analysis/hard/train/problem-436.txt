If a set of religious beliefs disenfranchises anyone based on their gender or sexuality, those beliefs are shit. End of story.
"The Shahi Imam of Ahemdabad’s Jama Masjid Shabbir Ahmed Siddiqui in Gujarat made controversial remarks on December 4 saying those who give election tickets to Muslim women are against Islam and weakening the religion.".
Ah yeah, you might be right. At the same time women were also doing the best they could too, protecting the home when alone as well caring for children. I think that far back they didn't have gender roles because women were 'inferior', they did those things because women could nurse an infant and a man could wrestle a boar or elk. There's a sort of innocence in that simplicity of life; no one is having a good time and in order to survive you both had to work together.
That and we both still have our own lives that we don't interfere in. She has her own problems with friends I don't know? That's her project. I have issues with a family member that she doesn’t know? My project. If we need help, we ask each other.
In the ideal world, it's a harmony, co-exists thing. A husband is supposed to love their wife (aside from royals and arranged marriages, those are shit show), and if you love someone you wouldn't make them do things they wouldn't want to do.
It a perfect world it SHOULD be ok, because in the context a husband isn't supposed to give malicious orders or treat his wife with disrespect.
