I guess it's moot anyway because if this bill passes, being an actual good thing, some joke of a federal court will find a way to take up the case with no standing and no cognizable complaint and nuke it anyway.
This has to be code for "Some awful shitty corporation is paying us to not do this for some dumbass reason.".
That's all it is. Giving up a little sunlight while we shower & shave in order to play outside together later. It's literally nothing more than that.
It's actually the other way around I think. The northern states prefer DST since it results in a bit more evening light in the winter (because the further north you go in winter, the less overall daylight there is).
I prefer DST because I’m up north and I don’t like 4:30PM sunsets but at this point idc. Just pick one and stick with it. I don’t understand why we change the clocks to adjust to work schedules, schools, etc. Why can’t we just adjust when work starts, schools open, etc.
I’d be okay if they slowly converted. Aka replace signs as they need to be replaced. I’m not about just changing it overnight. That would be insanely expensive to change every sign, law, etc in one going.
