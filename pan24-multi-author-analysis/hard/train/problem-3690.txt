The teaser says that McConnell's simple public opposition to it is giving other republicans cold feet who it is suggested would otherwise vote for it.
it's his senior status in the senate and especially among republicans that's doing it. Not anything procedurally at this point, at least beyond the filibuster.
I think it's the filibuster. And to make it worse, you only have to make it known you will filibuster, you don't actually have to do it. In the old days, senators would speak at the podium for as long as they could to block the vote. If they don't want to get rid of the filibuster, they should absolutely bring that requirement back. If you want to filibuster, you should have to work for it.
If we're going to have a filibuster, it really needs to be a speaking filibuster. Preferably one with rules where you have to be talking about the subject under debate. Iirc Texas has pretty decent filibuster rules the Senate could adopt.
Need 60 votes in the Senate to pass a bill around the filibuster. Democrats have a majority at 51, but they need 9 Republicans to break ranks and vote for legalization in order to actually pass it. Otherwise the bill just dies.
