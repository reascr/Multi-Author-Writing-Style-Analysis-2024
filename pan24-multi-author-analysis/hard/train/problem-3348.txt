Did you know that only 45% of all UN condemnations are about Israel now? This year Israel-Palestine almost broke the top 25 most violent ongoing conflicts! They need to crank those numbers up.
No the Palestinians have never been genocided, their casualties have been consistently very low because Israel moves mountains to try to protect them from their leadership who use them as human shields.
Nah, because despite the propaganda ultimately Israel is just defending itself against Palestinian aggression. The occupation and war could end tomorrow if the Palestinians just embrace they're never going to wipe out Israel and kill all the Jews.
Weird since Palestine is the one that said they wonâ€™t accept peace without the eradication of Israel and their leaders calling for the deaths of Jews worldwide.
Israel wasn't a UN project, they wanted it to be but the Arabs rejected the UN proposal and tried to genocide the Jews.
let's be even handed here, Israel is the UN's first project so everyone who opposes Israel tries to use the UN as if it was the fire of mount doom.
Holding Israel to a different standard is what is the problem here, during 2022 the UN condemned Israel 14 times (iirc) and Russia only 6 times?
Are you telling me that Israel's conduct warranted more than twice the condemnations that Russia got?
UN condemnations are basically and are used to bully Israel while other much worse offenders get on their high horses to parctice their hypocrisy.
