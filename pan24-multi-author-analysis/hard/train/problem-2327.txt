This is democracy in practice. If the people do not care, then they are going to get this every time.
Basically, the city council was a bunch of sellouts, the mayor guy was a sellout and they ousted the one person who wasn't a sellout.
Not to say what’s happening here was ok. Just that the mayor being not elected by the full city population is fairly common.

“ In lots of small towns actually the mayor is just a ceremonial figure, often someone sitting in city council already, voted on by the city council. And it’s the city manager who is in charge of actually running the city city government. Not every city is mayored like a New York or Chicago.”.
As troubling as this is it’s not uncommon for city councils to pull this kind of rank. The logic is the mayor is more of a figure head and the council has all the real legislative power. Still this situation should be monitored so it doesn’t get any more shady.
