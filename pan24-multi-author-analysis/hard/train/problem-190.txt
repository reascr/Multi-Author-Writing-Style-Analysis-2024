Just did a quick Google search. In New Zealand jt is a regulated profession and requires a bachelors degree in midwifery. I think the issue is that midwives do attend university and get this degree and need a license to practice but it may attract people who think that home births are the best way and that modern medicine is a sham. I have no issues with midwives (or potentially going to a birth Center to deliver a baby), but modern medicine has saved countless lives and the people making up the medical system have years and years of training under their belt. Also, these parents are scared blood “may” kill their child. You know what wil 1000 percent kill your child? Not having heart surgery.
It’s possible for sure. Regardless that is a fucked up situation. I cannot believe someone would rather have their baby die than receive a life saving procedure.
The issue is more complicated if the thing experts agree is safe is necessary to save your child's life.
The parents also refused to have the childs blood tested, or have a chest xray done. So you're wrong. They're horrible.
You're not crazy for wanting to avoid things you think are too risky even if the experts say theyre safe. Tegasesfor example needs to be heated over normal cooking temps to produce any off gases and residential weed killer has safe use directions/guidelines written on them. Its comforting to know thag organizations like the FDA regularily force recalls for items that are deemed to be too risky/toxic/prone to mis-use. Companies often voluntarily recall items too.
