When Congress passed the spending bill, I would say they authorized the debt. The Treasury should just keep holding bond auctions and dare Congress or SCOTUS to stop them.
The coin would sort of preclude having to issue new debt but the US would continue honouring all old bonds.
So many people who have these conservative values about personal debt (which are very good) get worked up about national debt, but they are so different you cannot compare.
Most national debt is held in that nation by retirement funds and investment banks and giant corporations etc.
Isn't the biggest debt holder the American people? So even if China holds a big chunk it's still going to be smaller than all of the debt held by Americans.
That’s why I don’t understand why people get so up in arms about China owning lots of US debt like it makes us dependent on them in some way. It’s the complete opposite. If China gets too uppity and does something like invade Taiwan, we just say “hey, you know that trillions off dollars we owe you? Yeah.. about that.. we’re not going to pay you back”.
