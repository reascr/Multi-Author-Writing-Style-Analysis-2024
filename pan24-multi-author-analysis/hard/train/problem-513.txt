Since the first WTC bombing at least. . . I felt it as a kid but never really understood why everything I was taught about being a nice person, sharing, courtesy etc. was ignored by the same adults and types who pushed these ideas. First I thought maybe because I'm a child and adults don't have to be nice to us (I mean, adults in my family weren't very nurturing either. . .just religion), maybe the way my mom would allow me to dress (no MC Hammer baggy pants or vanilla ice lined haircut for me!), maybe because I was apparently poor at the time? Not once did it cross my mind that it was due to my black hair, brown eyes, and skin that didn't show all my veins. . .
Oof. I can relate. I’m still having record scratch, freeze frame moments when I realize that no, it wasn’t me, it was because I was disabled. Some adults treated me horribly and hypocritically just because they hated how I made them feel. By pointing out their own mortality. How Just World Fallacy can’t fit disabled kids. How their cruelty was noticed and recognized to angry retorts of “bleeding heart, crybaby, too sensitive” or as I got older “you’re paranoid, alarmist, you see a therapist”.
Nothing I could’ve done would’ve changed the fact that me existing with health issues screwed with their ideas about how the world was and wasn’t.
