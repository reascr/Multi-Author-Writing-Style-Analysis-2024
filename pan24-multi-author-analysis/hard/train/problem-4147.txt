The greatest finesse is how the commercial fishing industry was able to shift attention to the fake issue of straws from the thousands and thousands of pounds of plastic and netting they put in the ocean.
And most importantly, the vast majority of plastic in the oceans comes from fishing net disposal, while the vast majority of plastic straws don't end up in the ocean because they go to the landfill.
As if Westerners using plastic straws are responsible for the world’s oceans becoming plastic dumps and not all the Asian countries that use and treat the oceans as a landfill.
Plastic bags generate 39% less greenhouse gas emissions than uncomposted paper bags and 68% less greenhouse gas emissions than composted paper bags.
Plastic grocery bags consume 71% less energy during production than paper bags. Significantly, even though traditional disposable plastic bags are produced from fossil fuels, the total non-renewable energy consumed during their lifecycle is up to 36% less than the non-renewable energy consumed during the lifecycle of paper bags and up to 64% less than that consumed by biodegradable plastic bags.
After four or more uses, reusable plastic bags are superior to all types of disposable bags — paper, polyethylene, and compostable plastic, across all significant environmental indicators.
When you consider the entire life cycle of packaging, paper and cardboard represent far greater environmental impact than their plastic equivalents. A recent ULS report comparing plastic and paper bags concluded that:
