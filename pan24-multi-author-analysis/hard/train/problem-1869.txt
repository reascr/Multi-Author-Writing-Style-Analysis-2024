Undeniably so. During his declaration of war special military operation speech back in February, the guy openly said that Lenin and Stalin made mistakes and that many countries came into existence in 1917 which never should have been allowed to do so, due to a lack of precedent for independence. And obviously who better to reestablish the union than Daddy Putin?
The problem is that Russia - or at least Putin and many Russian nationalists - does not see it that way. They see Ukraine (and Belarus) as really being Russian land and the people really being brainwashed Russians.
Ukraine was nowhere near being an ally to NATO prior to 2014, most people were still skeptical of NATO due to lingering Soviet influence. And even after 2014 there were still limits in how much support countries in NATO gave Ukraine - they did drastically improve the military but they made no effort to, say, train Ukrainian pilots on Western aircraft or train Ukrainian soldiers on Western artillery or vehicles (or even convert Ukraine to NATO-compatible equipment).
Of course I want NATO and the US to supply Ukraine with even more and it is frustrating to see them refuse to supply long range munitions while my relatives have to hide in the basement from missile strikes, but I'm also grateful that NATO and other nations have provided so much and continue to assert their support for Ukraine. If support was not provided - both when the war started in 2014 and when it escalated in 2022 - I know that people would have still fought against Russia but it would have been even more brutal and difficult for the people to stand against Russian imperialism.
Are you saying that NATO has not supported Ukraine enough and that no republic of Russia would want to experience war?
