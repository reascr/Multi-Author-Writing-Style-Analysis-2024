I agree, running Afghanistan as a puppet until we got tired of it was hardly defensive. To this day it confounds me why the US couldn't just focus on bringing Osama/AQ to justice without having to invade Afghanistan and leave it 20 years later even worse off than before—but of course, Bush's neocons didnt have much in the way of brains.
There's a difference between begrudgingly accepting an authoritarian ruler and a hostile takeover by a foreign country. One is a shit but at least somewhat stable government, another is a complete denial of your national identity and what little autonomy you had left. I know a few Belarusians (who still live there) and at least from their perspective, a Russian annexation would lead to complete revolution. They've also said that if belarus enters the war in Ukraine, it'll probably also lead to a revolution.
That would depend on if the Belarus military could be convinced to join in. It would be vastly unpopular, but so was mobilization in Russia. If the military went along with the idea, that’s another 400k troops if you count active and reserves.
You can have 400K troops or 400 million. Is doesn't matter if you can't supply them. Russia didn't even have enough trucks for the first invasion, why would they have enough for the second?
