People frequently say this in these threads, but it's about as accurate as "both-sidesing" U.S. political parties. If you look at Ukraine's reported numbers on various things in the war, they come a hell of a lot closer to numbers confirmed by other sources than the Russian's numbers do.
I mean sure, the Russian military has been a complete clusterfuck in this war, but they definitely have more experience than anyone else with burning tanks.
Although I am sure the Russians will claim to have destroyed these tanks, probably before they even arrive, like the last few times they claimed to destroy weapons which hadn't arrived in Ukraine yet, but I doubt they will actually destroy many of them.
As for Challengers chances against Russian tank armour, they should be able to handle everything up to the latest Refleks ERA equipped tanks, depending if the Russians ERA is empty or not….
Challengers are far from invulnerable as said, but it depends what the Russians throw at them and much much much more importantly, how the Ukrainians use them.
The Russian tank ammo situation is apparently dire. This has been the case since the beginning of the war when we have seen captured or abandoned tanks.
They’re using 70’s and 80’s vintage and sometimes practice ammunition if those initial reports are still accurate. Some of them have entire loads of GLATGM’s. Again, this was the case in the opening months of the war, I don’t know about recently. Challenger 2 should be nearly impervious in the front armoured sections to everything but the more recent 2000’s era Russian ammunition.
