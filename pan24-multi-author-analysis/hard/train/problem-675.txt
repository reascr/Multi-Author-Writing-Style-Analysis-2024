Yep, if nothing else, this is an incredible deterrence for China and other would be invaders. This investment may literally save America trillions in defense spending in the future. If America has made it clear that they will support a defender in a war, others will think twice before invading.
(I understand the sentiment of some of the commenters and agree that, in principle, war bad. But you have to realize that russia does not seem to stop until forced to do so. And if Ukraine stops fighting, you would be having same discussion about war in Poland or Baltics 10 years from now).
I think is under appreciated of how much shit we in Ukraine are dealing with. Russia fails on the battlefield and bombs our peaceful cities in an attempt to leave us in the cold and in the dark.
Paradoxically, even with this large aid packets we are not given tanks or long-range artillery in the fears of escalation. I would argue that wiping out russian military capacity will end this war. And no more aid will be needed.
