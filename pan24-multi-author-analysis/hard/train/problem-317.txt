Trump is a fucking psychotic narcissist. Skips the first day of a tournament, then inserts himself with a 5 point lead on day two. You can bet his under educated followers support this without giving it a thought.
I am reminded of North Korea's Kim Jong Il who claimed to have had a birdie or better on every hole of.
I don't think so. It was the doctor who reported that a lonime personal bodyguard for Trump, along with a top lawyer at the Trump Organization and a third man, conducted a "raid" on his office on Feb. 3, 2017, in which they seized the president's medical records. This was days after the NYT published a story that the president takes a prostate-related drug to treat baldness, known as Propecia, as well as other "antibiotics to control rosacea, a common skin problem, and a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids.".
Oh yeah. I remember. The right wing website Judicial Watch kept a running tab of all of Obamas travel expenses while President. They said he was accountable to the taxpayers for that and highlighted all of the expenses for Obamas personal travel (Ex: visiting Hawaii with family).
Right? None if them think "hey, this guy's a cheater. Maybe he was making up that 'rigged election' stuff!".
