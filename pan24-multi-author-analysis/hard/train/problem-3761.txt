Same as people wearing seatbelts when they drive. Being prepared doesn't mean you are perpetually afraid of being in a car accident.
Wearing a seatbelt and carrying a gun stems from a similar desire to be prepared for the possibility of dangerous scenarios.
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. There are plenty of reasons a person might carry a gun, but you refuse to believe that. The are entire subreddits and youtube channels showing people defending themselves and their families with a gun. Just because you don't understand the reasons, doesn't mean there aren't any.
Those aren't reasons. That's just what you think. Why don't you go ask someone why they carry a gun instead of making insulting assumptions about why they do it?
Guns are far, far too casually treated, and far too many gun owners are devoid of sense and/or think control of a firearm stops when they leave the range.
when it comes to a gun forrgetfulness turns into neglectfulness and Possible Danger. When was the last item you forgot that could kill or hurt someone?
