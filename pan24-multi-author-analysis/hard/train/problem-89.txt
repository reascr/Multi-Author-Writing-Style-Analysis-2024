Yeah once Russia gets pushed out of Crimea in a bit.. I wonder if Chechnya or Georgia will get any support from Ukraine or Europe if they attempt to get out from under .
Maybe, but that type of support is a long ways off for the Ukraine part of it. If the war ends Ukraine (rightfully) isn't going to be quick to volunteer troops or equipment to assist other people in similar situations simply because they can't. They'll have a massive rebuilding phase to deal with, and on top of that they'll be under constant risk of attack no matter what Russia says in any peace treaty. Everything they have will go to repairing their society and fortifying their boarders. They may be able to give token assistance to countries in need out of compassion, but for many years that's likely going to be about it.
Edit: There's nothing wrong with giving minimal assistance that is essentially unnoticeable in the overall scheme of things, many countries have shown support for others engaged in major wars by sending just a handful of troops or some slightly outdated equipment. I just wanted to clarify that Ukraine won't be in a position for anything like real, effective support for quite a long time.
