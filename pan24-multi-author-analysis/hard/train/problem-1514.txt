Assuming Biden has done nothing wrong, there's nothing to get ahead of. They can just do nothing and wait for the absence of evidence. Instead they are preparing to discredit the investigators. Why is it okay to investigate Trump for crimes and not okay to investigate Biden for crimes? Of course presidents shouldn't be above the law.
No, this is not a bipartisan effort. No, they are not defending Joe Biden, they are attacking the republicans who intend to investigate Joe Biden.
As GOP goes down the rabbit hole of investigating its own bizarre conspiracy theories, Biden makes them look foolish and then pulls the rug by not running.
Yeah Biden can once again step up and take the heat as Republicans endlessly attack him and a younger Dem works to get the 2024 nomination and Biden just retires.
House Republicans will throw everything they can at Biden and nothing at the insurrectionists within their ranks.
That's an excellent point. Reminds me of 2012. The Republicans took the House in 2010 midterms and had the wind in their sails. They genuinely believed they would coast to victory in 2012 but then reality hit them hard.
