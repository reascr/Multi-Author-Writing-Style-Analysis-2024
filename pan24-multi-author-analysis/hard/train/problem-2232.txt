Like the US has helped in many genocides, massacres and atrocities around the world. If they speak about it without denouncing their own actions, all it sounds like "it's okay for us to murder children, genocide civilizations and create global chaos, fund terrorism for the sake of cheaper oil and global dominance but when you buy cheap oil, it's unacceptable.".
I mean, partly they are. Ukraine didn't help India in most of its UN votes, they were against India getting a seat in UNSC and almost always voted against India. As far as India is concerned, Ukraine never did us any favors and were quite often against us.
Please tell me what kind of support did India provided to Ukraine against the terrorist state Russia? They are a space, military, IT, nuclear, everything superpower, why don't they support Ukraine more?
Why don’t they support Ukraine more? Because Russia has been a long time ally, so India even sending medical supplies and humanitarian aid to Ukraine is good to see. But definitely could be better, yes.
Back to the original topic. Is the EU not the largest funder of genocide in Ukraine? Not only have they funded Russia for decades, even after Russia stole Crimea, but the EU is still Russia’s biggest customer.
Buying a product at break even or less to Russia and then using it against them (monetary conversion to Ukrainian support). I guess that's a low blow to Russia, so maybe it is a bit morally gray.
