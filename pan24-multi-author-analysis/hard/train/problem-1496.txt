Even if India had stopped buying Russian oil, the whole world would still feel the consequences since Europe imports exponentially more Russian oil than India as of today.
Because all of these countries have been decreasing their imports of Russian oil and gas since the war started, whereas India has greatly increased its imports of oil from Russia.
You want everyone to cut off purchases for Russian oil, while none of the other oil producing countries have increased their oil production. This means there has been a huge spike in the prices of non-Russian oil, while its supply has remained constant but demand has increased due to Europeans pivoting to other sources. Now rich Europeans can afford to pay this skyrocketing price, but developing countries cannot. So you expect poor developing countries to starve, because Europeans were either too dumb or too greedy to understand that they shouldn't become so reliant on a country for their energy, especially after Crimea.
Yeah but this is their chance to bitch about Europe being bad so theyâ€™ll take it while India virtue signals about having the right to buy cheap Russian oil and complain about food supplies being sparse.
