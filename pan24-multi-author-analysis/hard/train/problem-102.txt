High explosives don't look like this. Watch footage of a controlled demolition, or go over to r/CombatFootage and look at munitions exploding. There's very little flame/fire involved. Hollywood doesn't use those explosives because they're not visually impressive enough.
Have to factor in greatly increased shipping costs. Pipeline to EU is very cheap compared to shipping to India. Add to that the lack of available ships thanks to the sanctions that just kicked in, and lawl. At fifty two dollars they are losing money.
North of Svatove there's a Russian border town called Valuyki, with a fairly major rail depot. That directly connects to the occupied Ukrainian town of Troitsky, which in turn has a road running due south to Svatove. And the rail line continues from Troitsky down to the eastern Luhansk area. Farther east of that there's mostly nothing but rural communities, the next Russian rail line doesn't enter Ukraine until way farther east and south.
But the rail line through Starobilsk doesnt go directly towards Donetsk, but ends somewhere near the coast in Luhansk as far as I know.
Svatove covers one of the few rail lines going from the Moscow direction directly towards Luhansk/Donetsk. The next best line goes throug Starobilsk further to the east, which would in itself be a detour and would prolong the transit times of goods.
Russia also has another railroad to the east of Svatove at Starobilsk, which is currently the only railway running north --> south from Russia into Ukraine.
Basically enables Ukraine to maneuver around Lsychansk and Sverodonetsk and cuts Russian supplies by rail and road. Svatove has lots of communication routes to the rest of luhansk oblast.
And on the flip side, Ukraine has a large rail connection at Kupyans'k. Which has both a rail and a highway connection southeast to near Svatove, and from there south to Kreminna and Lysychansk. Once they control Svatove, they have a clear shot to Lysychansk. Which is the major regional objective.
