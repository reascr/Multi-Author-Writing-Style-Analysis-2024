So much for Wiki's supposed NPOV I suppose, not that that has been true for the last decade or so...
Leaving aside that the Wiki Foundation shouldn't have an opinion in the first place, because there is no way it won't infiltrate Wikipedia itself...
Opinion is opinion, and my argument simply is that it's bleeding obvious that the Wiki isn't neutral even though they claim to be; anything else doesn't come into it.
Honestly, I really don't care... Every time I criticize Wiki for being somewhat less than impartial or neutral i get downvoted.
Thank you, I'm happy to collect downvotes from people that still think that the Wiki is still in any way remotely impartial with regards to any current and even remotely controversial topics.
The rest of your comment was a non sequitur about articles on Wikipedia, which has nothing to do Wikimedia Foundation's criticism of this bill in this article. The Wikimedia Foundation itself has no policy of remaining neutral outside of projects nor should it. That's an unreasonable standard no other organization is held to.
