see, that's exactly the problem that this solves for guys. There's no way for a guy to know a woman took hers either. Now the guy gets his own control before the bedroom as well. Most guys have had to deal with this exact problem for their entire lives - "What if the condom breaks? I really hope she isn't lying about being on birth control", etc.
As you said, no method is 100% effective, so when you employ more than one method (safe sex/condoms in addition to birth control, which can now happen on both sides) then that is the best you can do all around.
There are a couple of problems: no birth control method is 100% effective, and there's no way of knowing whether the man taking the pill has actually done so, unless the woman watches him do it, or whether the pill is the right one.
The problem is, at least going by news articles, is that the freedom to 'drive a bit to another' is being attacked by the Christian Taliban, and isn't always possible for people that hevn't got a lot of money. Moreover, there seem to be some serious attempts to make abortion a Federal crime.
