On a side note we have seen throughout history environmental disasters, human suffering, workers dying tragically and needlessly because of one thing. The wealthy's pursuit of profit with no regard for the people. This even highlights one thing that is getting scant coverage. Privet enterprise needs to be regulated and those regulations need to be robustly enforced by a strong federal government. We need to tax the wealthy that need this oversite to pay for the oversite. The regulations while they should be mindful of costs should always put people over profits.
Despite the fact that the rail companies are the ones responsible does the media focused on them. Did they name one rail executive or the majority owners and point out they did this. The media chose instead to focus on Biden. Had Biden not intervened, the media would, instead of blaming the executives and owners, blamed Biden for the shortages and additional inflation it caused.
Yeah, how dare the media point out that Biden's union busting 3 months prior to this disaster is largely responsible for this disaster. We should all definitely be mad at someone other than Biden. Great take right here. Well done.
