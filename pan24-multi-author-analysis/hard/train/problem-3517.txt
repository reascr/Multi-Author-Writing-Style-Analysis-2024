>Biden aides have been sifting through documents stored at locations beyond his former Washinon office to determine if there are any other classified documents that need to be turned over to the National Archives and reviewed by the Justice Department, the person familiar with the matter said.
One, where the National Archives tells Biden all documents appear to be accounted for; then years later Biden's people volunteer the information that they discovered potentially classified materials in an office space no longer used and use due diligence to make sure any other unrecovered documents are found and turned over..
"WASHINGTON â€” Aides to President Joe Biden have discovered at least one additional batch of classified documents in a location separate from the Washinon office he used after leaving the Obama administration, according to a person familiar with the matter.".
Yes. If they found them, and they immediately (within reason, of course) report them and turn them in, they are remedying it as quickly as possible.
So, unless you're implying that they should have remedied the situation before they were aware if it, then your question was either dishonest or incompetent.
