Days into controlling the U.S. House, Republicans quickly tackled the creation of one of their top agenda items: a special congressional panel focused on alleged “weaponization of the federal government.”.
Based on what top Republicans have said, the committee is poised to hit a GOP sweet spot of tackling broader issues of importance to the party base while allowing themselves many chances to attack President Joe Biden and his administration.
The committee that all Republicans voted to establish on Tuesday—as part of the House Judiciary Committee—has broad powers to investigate current and past investigations conducted by the FBI and Department of Justice, as well as the authority to probe “any” issues related to the civil liberties of private citizens.
GOP lawmakers speak expansively about the committee’s purview, comparing it to the Church Committee of the 1970s, which exposed an array of intelligence agency abuses. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), the No. 2 Republican, said the new panel would be focused on the protection of “everyday” American citizens.
A way to claim the only protection a citizen has from the government is the Republican Party. A party where liars, pedophiles, tax cheats, nazis, homophobes are solicited and protected. Gym Jordan is in charge of investigations so you’re safe.
