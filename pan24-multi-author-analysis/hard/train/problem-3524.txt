"Your restaurant required employees to wash their hands after using the restroom despite some employees saying that it's their choice whether they do so or not!".
P.S. It doesn't have to be defined in the state Constitution, just in the law. For example, the federal Civil Rights Act is where a lot of federal class protections are defined and it's a law, not a Constitutional Amendment.
Like I said, I think the notion that anti-vaxxers deserve special treatment is baloney, but that's the argument.
I don't agree with the anti-vaxxers in FL, but to play Devil's Advocate the legal argument would be that this is similar to requiring businesses to make reasonable accommodations and not to refuse service to people with medical issues. The FL Dept of Health would be arguing that whether or not someone is vaccinated is a private medical issue that should have no bearing on their ability to access FL businesses. Basically the state does have some authority to regulate if businesses can turn away certain classes of people if they can argue that those classes deserve government protection.
