I'll agree Manchin or Sinema wouldn't have gone for it. But I think we should be clear, the original authors of the bills intent is just as good as legal experts and counsel opinions. What's lawful will be decided by the Supreme Court.
The question at hand is whether the president actually has the legal authority to do the thing he did... Who else, if not the Supreme Court, do you want to decide that question?
I don’t think any Supreme Court would want to overturn something of this precedent on standing, arguably paving the way for future presidents to do something like this.
The states apart of the lawsuit have a cognizable injury as soon the debt is forgiven, at least in my eyes. I understand the purpose of standing, and it isn’t something that should be looked away from. But if that’s the case, any acting president can do something like this (above the legislature) then not be challenged until after the fact. This goes way passed executive power.
Billions of dollars of loans being forgiven creates a plethora of economic problems. If the loans are forgiven, then the problems arise. This is an injury for people all around. Especially states, whose economies get hit. I get the standing argument I just feel as though this case is slightly different due to the potential repercussions.
I understand the issue, but I don’t think standing is as relevant as you make it out to seem. The injury is clear as billions will be forgiven “if and when we prevail in court” (according to the department of education). This seems enough to meet the injury requirement of standing to me. Reasonable minds could differ but I think it would be a worse precedent personally to not accept this case, giving future presidents the potential power to do this (when it likely isn’t constitutional).
