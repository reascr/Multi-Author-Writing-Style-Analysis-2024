The Islamic Republic kills everyone. Man, woman, Kurd, Non-Kurd it doesn't matter. 3 years ago tomorrow the Islamic Republic shot down a plane and killed 176 people of all ethnicities.
Remember that this whole thing started when Mahsa Amini was killed, and it is reported that Mahsa was not interested in politics and didn't really care to go against the regime. Yet they killed her because the morality police had a bad day that day.
I am not denying the fact that the Islamic Republic oppresses Kurds. I am not even denying that the Islamic Republic oppresses Kurds more than other ethnicities (maybe other than the Baloch). I am merely pointing out that the overwhelmingly vast majority of Iranians are being tyrranized by the Islamic Republic.
Many Iranians are against the Islamic Republic and all the authoritarians who are enabling these atrocities. Sanctions hurts those Iranians who want freedom and makes it harder for them to fight back. Being hungry and poor makes it harder to fight back.
Obviously the sanctions are intended to target the leaders and authoritarians, and they work to a degree. Without the sanctions, those same assholes would have even more power and money to oppress Iranians.
But frankly, Iranians getting executed by their own government without any form of able resistance... Is just I don't really see any other help they can get.
The Iranian people won’t be free until every government official backing the power of the state has been killed or put in prison, and all I’ve seen is just innocent protesters being massacred and executed. So I ask again how? How will the Iranian people be free?
Unfortunately I probably agree. Fuck totalitarian leaders. There’s never a good answer to stopping them. No matter what it seems the innocent citizens take to brunt of the violence.
