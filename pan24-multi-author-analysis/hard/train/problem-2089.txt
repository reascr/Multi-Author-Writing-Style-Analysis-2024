Yeah, you right. I don't speak to russian people on the regular, because I live 40 km from russian border, and topics to talk with those people don't lead to much good. But our argument is not about that, but that you ignore 90% of what's happening and pointing out at the rest 10%. Never said that they can't buy Apple. Did I? Why you argue with that?

Ukraine transports russian gas across to neighbours like Hungary, because Hungary government insisted and veto sanctions over that gas. Ukraine doesn't buy gas from russia since 2015.
About apple being smuggled in russia it isn't unexpected. But what it tells - someone still want to buy it, and some still want to sell it. And this isn't like sanctions took full effect yet.
