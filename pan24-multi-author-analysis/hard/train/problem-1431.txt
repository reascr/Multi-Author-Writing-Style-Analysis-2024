The original ruling was flawed and was destined to be overturned. Even RBG acknowledged it was a weak ruling with very little to stand on. Plus why would one of the conservative judges leak one of their own opinions? That accusation makes no sense in itself.
You're presuming he had a clear-headed reason for doing it, and that may not be the case. He may have just been excited to tell someone. He leaked the Hobby Lobby case to some dinner guests.

ALITO A whistle-blower literally came forward during this investigation saying Alito had, in the past, leaked a future decision to one of his nutty evangelical friends And the republican appointed to investigate this of course didn't want to fuck over Alito, and Robert's knows it was Alito which is why he's been so silent since it first got leaked.
