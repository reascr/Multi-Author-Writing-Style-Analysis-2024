If you follow Russian logic, Ukraine could just annex some parts of western Russia, declare it Ukrainian souvereign territory (maybe declare a mock referendom or two for good measure) and then rain missiles on it.
If Russia is pushed back all the way to the 1991 borders (UA is willing to fight, the only question is if we are willing to arm them appropriately) and Russia still bombards Ukraine with cruise missiles, I suspect we'd see the political calculus in the West change dramatically. For now, better to do everything possible to stymie Putin's attempts to make this war "a great patriotic cause" for the Russian people while ramping up support to Ukraine.
Even if Russia is pushed all the way back to the border, they will still be free to shell Ukraine with artillery, launch airstrikes, fire cruise missiles, attack with drones, and so on. If you can't return fire at the source of those attacks, you've got no real chance at a military victory, and your survival relies entirely on your enemy eventually just giving up.
It's a recipe for eventual defeat if Russia doesn't experience a dramatic change in policy or leadership.
Honestly I wish we could get a more reasonable interpretation of this mainstream. When your enemy is attacking your infrastructure, hampering your means to produce and repair the defensive systems you need on top of all the damage it's doing to your civilian population, being restricted from striking back in kind borders on the absurd.
