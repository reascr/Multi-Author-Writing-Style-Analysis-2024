I think you are gonna have a hard time convincing Ukraine to use diplomacy when a 1/4 of the country is still occupied by Russia and there infrastructure has been destroyed.
If Russia can restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity (including Crimea), Ukraine is open to talk, but that condition is almost impossible to be agreed by Putin, so why wasting time on it? All other “diplomacy” has the implication that Ukraine has to give up more territory, which is dumb af to even think about. Do we really want to reward the fucking invader again after Crimea?
So push Russia for retreat, freeing Crimea and Donbass, and paying reparations to Ukraine? Or does he expect that Ukraine has to be the only one to give in?
Ukraine is in a conundrum. Even if they push to Russia's border, they can't go any farther, because much of the western assistance is predicated on that. Russia would be humiliated, but that's about it as far is direct actions Ukraine can take. The war is going to end via peace talks one way or another. Putin isn't going to be overthrown by the Ukrainian army.
At the current time, if Putin were to be replaced, it's highly likely that the replacement would be even more nationalistic. In this regard, Putin isn't analogous to Hitler, he's probably more like Kaiser Wilhelm.
