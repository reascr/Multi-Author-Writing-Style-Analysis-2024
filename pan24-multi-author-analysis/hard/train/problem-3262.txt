same was done to native Americans, this shit is FUCKING disgusting and evil, taking people's kids because you disagree with their way of life, so fucking evil.
taking children from their homes is part of genocide, this is genocide that is what they are doing to the Tibetans right now they're committing genocide..
A lot of people think genocide requires mass murder, which is why I use the Lamkin quote. Genocide is the death of a culture of people, either through mass murder or serious injury, infantacide or sterilisation, removal of children or through deliberate hardship or difficult living conditions.
Just making the VERY obvious point that children dying of diseases (that were killing children of all races) is different than concentration camp style mass genocidal graves.
Separation if children from their parents en masse is a very cruel and sadly effective tool of cultural genocide. If you do this for one or two generations, you can eradicate most of the cultural distinction that makes up Tibetans.
Tibetans being abused by Chinese is pretty different than Native Canadians being abused by other Native Canadians, no?
