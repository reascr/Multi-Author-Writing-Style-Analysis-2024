A lot of big business is tied up in Iran for the Russian Jewish diaspora (and to some extent even Israel). Iran is the largest portal to Russia for commerce in the middle east. A stable Persian Jewish diaspora makes sense in Iran, and I think the business with Russia is the largest motivator to stay. Of course, it's their home too.
If anything, it's quite astonishing that in this heavy political climate, the people of Iran can clearly distinguish between the Israeli government and Jewish people (ethic and/or religious). This does reflect on the people/culture of Iran, however neutrally.
There used to be many thriving religious minorities in ancient Iranian empires because they were some of the most tolerant at the time. The founder of the first Iranian Empire, Cyrus the Great, is even in Judaism's texts for how he offered to take in the persecuted Jews of Babylon, even paying them to rebuild their temple.
Biblically, the Hebrews were invited to Persia as Cyrus and then Xerses as sought to build universities to strenhen the Empire. And as Jewish people normally do, they thrived in their new homes. Some Persians did not like that and wanted to expel the Hebrews. Xerses married Esther, a (secretly) Jewish woman and she used her position to protect the Hebrews people from this edict, saving them from harm. This story is commemorated in the holiday of Purim.
Yes, in fact the Jewish community of ancient Iran has a whole book dedicated to them in the Hebrew Bible, as well as the holiday of Purim. Today there are far less than there were before the creation of Israel and the Islamic Revolution.
