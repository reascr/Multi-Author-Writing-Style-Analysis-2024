In fact, I fear that this law may make companies more reticent to hiring women, because why have a worker that may be entitled to sick leave each month when you can hire someone that isn't.
You also seem to be ignoring that women who are incapacitated by their menstrual cycle already miss work, they just tend to take sick days to do it.
It’s crazy to me that you guys think no one involved in this legislation thought of that, and then having made that assumption you didn’t research it at all. Just like the US, Spain has protections against workplace discrimination based on sex/gender, hiring protections, etc.
Spain, much like many countries these days, has what's called non-descrimination laws in the workplace. When someone is so blasé about a topic like this, acting as though "women...won't show up" as if there is proof of this happening all the time, it goes to show how little empathy there is and stands in direct contradiction to what they think they're saying.
(I wholeheartedly appreciate that these guys tried it and hope it gives them some added sense of empathy towards period pain.).
And I bet the majority of it will come from people who have yet to try the cramp simulator for 10 minutes and then mention that they can't dance or go to work anymore.
