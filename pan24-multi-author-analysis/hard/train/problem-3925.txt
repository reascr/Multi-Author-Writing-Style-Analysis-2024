Jets are not able to be used effectively by either side due to the absolute massive amount of anti air weapons deployed on the field.
Theyâ€™re using artillery which is basically a technologically advanced trebuchet/mangonel. It does move but not while firing. It is possible to hit it back with your own artillery but they have different ranges and obviously yours would become a target the closer to the front lines it is as well.
Modern systems can be moved to and from firing positions in less than 5min after firing but both sides are lacking in Anti-artillery radars making the threat of counter-battery fire much less likely than what it should be when two "modern western armies" clash.
Yeah, I think they are falling into same "pit" that ruined Hitler's plans of taking over UK, had the Nazis kept on bombing just the factories and air fields and harbors they would have likely won but because of ideological & propagandist reasons they switched to blitzing civilian neighbourhoods as well which depleted their stocks with no strategic results what so ever... Russia is doing the same, wasting ammo like crazy to kill civilians thinking it will net them anything strategically or even tactically -shooting rockets to Kyiv or even to Kharkiv doesn't accomplish anything to advance their goals at this point.
