This also goes for societies were extreme prison sentences for minor offenses means that you are more likely to go down shooting cops and the public if it is the only chance you have to not be a prisoner forever.
If you're speaking broadly of capital punishment around the world, you're sort of right but most of the stuff "attached to don't die" involves not committing capital crimes. In other words, it deters murder etc.
But of course I'm talking about civilized countries with a rule of law. Russia has only rule of man so essentially, NOTHING works there. It's just crap no matter how you try to play it.
They now have first hand experience showing them they were lied to about the state of the war. Russia is fairing badly. Hundreds are dying every day. Ukraine is resisting; they are not being welcomed as saviors.
Many Ukrainian lives would be saved. Life in Russia would probably still be shit, but fuck 'em. They're the ones who decided not to respect any leader who isn't a shitty, violent autocrat.
