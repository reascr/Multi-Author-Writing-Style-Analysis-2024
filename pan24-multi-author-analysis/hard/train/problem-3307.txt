That and the fact that guns kill more people in household accidents or domestic violence than they do during actually self defense - not counting the almost daily mass shootings we see in the news .
Damn, maybe the other political party should get guns for self defence, instead of making it illegal for themselves to buy guns while leaving the other side in possession of all the arms they already have?
Absent a model like the latter, while guns are under regulated and buying is practically anonymous in leaky-faucet-like states (states where guns can be easily accessed and transported across statelines with ease, TX, FL, AL), guns are almost certainly ending up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them.
Just the same, you don't see a public register of who in your community is hoarding assault weapons and ammo, while they're planning an attack.
I’m scared too, of all these people walking around with guns, and Americans in general, but it does not drive me to go out and buy a gun. The right wing have convinced many people they the only way to address their fears are to buy guns, but guns are like security blankets for a lot of gun owners, and that’s even more true when you look at the most recent FBI stats and realize that only 3% of crimes were stopped by a civilian with a gun.
