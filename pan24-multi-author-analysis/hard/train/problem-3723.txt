Does a great job of explaining why this is more complicated than just forcing the railroads to add sick leave.
It's worth noting railway union workers already get paid sick leave. The problem though is they have to apply for that sick leave after the fact, it's not automatic as it often is in most other companies.
Individual members are irrelevant in contract negotiations because those contracts aren't negotiated between individual members but individual unions. I couldn't find a source on this but going from memory the total number of people for the contract vs. against was about split 50/50 (if there's a legitimate source that says otherwise happy to be corrected).
That was the demand from only 1/3 of the unions, the other 2/3 (8 of 12 involved) already signed and weren't contesting non-application-based sick leave.
“The major freight railroads refused to offer paid sick time last fall because they said the unions had agreed over the decades to forgo paid sick leave in favor of strong short-term disability benefits and higher pay.”.
