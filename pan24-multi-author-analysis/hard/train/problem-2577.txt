I don't know why any Liberal would further any kind of bans for guns when the death cult that is the GOP is heavily armed and willing to shit all over the rule of law. Seems foolish.
Getting really fucking tired of my supposed allies bringing up Trump as if it's some kind of catch all answer for Liberal bullshit. Get better and stop acting like the rule of law means anything without some sort of force to back it up. Conservatives get this, it's why Cops tend to support them.
So, mandatory waiting periods and red flag laws instead of disarmament seems like a better course of action. The GOP isn't going to get rid of their guns and I can't see LEOs being all the interested in disarming conservatives since they tend to be a) pro-gun and b) right-leaning.
Not down with disarming in anyway as long as Conservatism is as strong as it it is right now in this country. Better to do it after.
After what? These ideas are not going away. Make them criminals, and that goes for law enforcement who refuse to do their job. Rule of law, not desperado politics. Move forward. The demographics do not favour the "right white". Sorry.
