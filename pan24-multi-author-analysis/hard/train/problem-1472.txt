Qatar's 'kafala system' is a set of labour laws which allow Qatari individuals or businesses to confiscate workers' passports and stop them leaving the country.
Qatar ships in thousands of migrant workers, subjecting them to conditions internationally recognized as slavery - wage theft, seizure of passports, loss of rights etc. Migrants work in intolerable conditions. Labour laws seem lax, there are an indeterminate number of deaths which are suppressed and recategorised so Qatar doesn't even pay the pittance they offer as wages to widows. Billions are spent on building lawns in the middle of the desert in air conditioned stadia which will certainly be abandoned afterwards.
Qatar blatantly bribes FIFA for a tournament based on several promises including keeping the tournament in summer. This promise is immediately discarded and leagues have to halt halfway through the year to pack this tournament in. Qatar is a repressive regime, that routinely sentences people to death for crimes like being gay, and locks up dissidents and journalists for attempts to expose said regime. FIFA promises people can enjoy a normal world cup including being allowed to attend even if gay, drink beer, celebrate in public. All of these promises have been since revoked.
And on top of this FIFA has the gall to yell at us for being upset? I'm sorry, maybe if we'd all received the same bribes they have we'd be more ok with a repressive regime hosting a world cup in the winter. Or maybe, just maybe, they are crying foul because they know how much of a farce this all is, and are desperately scrambling for that higher ground, an action that is so laughably inappropriate for an organization like FIFA it beggars belief.
I hate FIFA as an organization so much its unreal, a rotting corrupt blight that is so self serving and scummy ir feels like a parody. Bet they wished more places could be built with the blood of dead slaves.
