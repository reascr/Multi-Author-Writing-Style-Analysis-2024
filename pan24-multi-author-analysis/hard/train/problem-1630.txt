Lmao. I’m blue collar and I took two sick days the beginning of this week. Sure, it’s just a sinus infection and a cold. But I got to cozy up under a blanket and play on my PS5 while getting paid. Then again, I handed in a two week time sheet with 130 hours — that doesn’t include my holiday pay for thanksgiving and Friday.
I’d like to see his 80 year old geriatric ass stand outside in the middle of a Phoenix summer with a corn hat for 8 hours with no shade. Note: I’m saying just stand. Not even pick up a shovel, haul up shit totaling over 1000 lbs 70 vertical feet by rope, or even on a rooftop inside an enclosed mechanical system where there is zero air conditioning and the body is stainless steel metal.
Those 8 unions make up less than half of all railroad workers. This isn’t hard to figure out. Ignore the number of unions, pay more attention to the percentage of workers that voted against this deal and told their union reps to try again or we strike.
Majorities in both parties voted to strip the unions of their right to strike and force an agreement on them that the majority of workers had already rejected.
The democrats did not have to vote to force the rail workers to accept the deal the union voted down.
Edit 3: Did the democrats have to pass a bill in the house forcing rail workers to into a contract the workers voted down?
Correct, why would the democrats pass a bill forcing the workers to accept a contract they rejected?
They’re literally forcing a contract on workers, of whom a majority of them voted to reject it. This removes their leverage. He absolutely is Union busting, he’s just covering his actions with white chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles.
