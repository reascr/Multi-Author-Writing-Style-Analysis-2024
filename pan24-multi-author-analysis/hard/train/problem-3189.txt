That'd be impossible. Russia only attacks hospitals and daycares, they'd never stoop so low as to hit a military target. That's just ungentlemanly. How are they supposed to fight back if you hurt their army instead of a bunch of strategically powerless civilians?
Nah, I don’t think it’s good to target civilians as revenge for an adversary doing so. From a moral perspective it’s obviously unacceptable. From a purely practical one, using cruelty as a weapon against the cruel tends not to work. You could blow up a school full of Russian children and the leaders of Russia would simply get excited at the opportunity that represented for them.
This is why I said Ukraine should target what Russia values - its power and prestige in the form of weapon systems and warfighting infrastructure it cannot replace.
Of course, Ukraine is supplied by weapons made outside Ukraine, so this effect isn’t very helpful to Russia.
Can you just imagine what Ukraine would be like today if they didn't receive all of the anti-air assistance? If those 76 missiles have landed, the casualties would've been ridiculous.
