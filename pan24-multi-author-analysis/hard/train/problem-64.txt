All of a sudden they become suicidal and decide to fall on several bullets as they jump out from the 8th floor.
Russian refugees into neighbouring baltic countries is clearly a national security issue (because Putin can and will use it as an excuse to Tey and annex territory from bordering countries).
Also, given Latvia are a former soviet satellite nation witnessing their former overlord invade and brutalize another former soviet satellite nation, why wouldn't they be so-called "Russophobic"?
So yeah, Russians have an incredibly strong presence/influence in Estonia and efforts to integrate them (as opposed to them just carving out their own Russian community inside Estonia) are dog whistled as Russophobia and mistreatment which is bullshit.
As said elsewhere here; Many were forced to relocate against their will and then, a bit ironically, found themselves in another, not overly friendly country, but still choosing to stay and considering themselves as being Russians, but not willing to move back because their country is still worse than being a part of an unpopular minority in Estonia.
As usual though, there are plenty of Russians that come/came to Estonia that have happily integrated and became Russian-Estonians/Estonian-Russians but they tend to send their kids to Estonian schools, learn the language, don't vote for the Russian party (Centre party), and don't fucking support the invasion.
There is a political party, the Estonian Centre Party, a populist party that essentially represents the interests of Russians in Estonia and they are very influential because they get so many votes (from Russians in Estonia).
