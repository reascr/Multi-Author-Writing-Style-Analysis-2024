The issue is that Turkey doesn't recognize Cyprus, and that certainly predates Erdogan. His personal politics aren't the cause of this decision, the previous invasion and the current occupation of Cyprus are.
You can add them up to the amount that died from everything involving Cyprus, there was a literal war that caused this scenario after all. But the reason for none of those deaths was or is ego, and understanding something is better than pretending the world is simpler than it is.
They don't recognize the country is the issue, not even the occupation. Turkey pretends Cyprus doesn't exist, so they can't accept aid from something that doesn't exist.
Turkey literally cut their island in half with a DMZ that stands today and Cyprus was still willing to help... but Turkey isn't ready for that level of human kindness yet.
Turkey shouldn't have refused the aid plan from Cyprus since over 25M people needed shelter & food & medicine to survive. A genuinely wonderful government should put up with its political ideas for the time being to take care of its people. It means that the government should be an unselfish organization. Erdogan's government should think carefully about this.
It's not like Turkey was the world leader in building regulations before Erdogan. Earthquake resistance has always been terrible there and Turkey has a shit safety culture.
