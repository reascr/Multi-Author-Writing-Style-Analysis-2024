It is not the government of Canada causing the problems it is the provincial regulators who are in charge of accreditation. The provincial governing bodies are run by doctors who don't want more competition for the dollars available. Take the accreditation process out of the hands of doctors and put it with a provincial government agency and the accreditation problem will go away. The way it is now it's like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse.
No the provincial colleges of Physicians do. Some provinces don't have colleges of physicians like Ontario does, so they have other names. It is a provincial jurisdiction. Even moving from one province to another poses problems for physicians in Canada.
Sadly this is true, the medical system in Canada is slow and unwieldy and incentivises good doctors to seek employment elsewhere, where they can make better salaries.
People like you see these numbers and think these doctors are so wealthy, but in reality, with the cost of living in many major hubs in the country, we don't pay physicians enough in Canada to retain them.
Both the US and Canada should be training vastly more doctors, but people within the profession shortsightedly advocate against it because it means less scarcity inflated salaries. Itâ€™s bad for everyone.
