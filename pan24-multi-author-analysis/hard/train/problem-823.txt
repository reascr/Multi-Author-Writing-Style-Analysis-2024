The system was designed before political parties existed. It was unfathomable that elected representatives would collide with a judge or president from the other side of the country to break laws together.
They're pretty openly against appointing more justices, despite the fact that it is necessary to save democracy and beyond that it would greatly improve the efficiency of the Court...
I can't imagine why we, the people of the United States, would feel that a Supreme Court that was disproportionately appointed by presidents that lost the popular vote, is illegitimate.
Bring it, you stooges of the right, nominated by presidents who couldn't even convince a majority of the electorate to get behind them. You are proving to be a vital and powerful overreaching force hellbent on pushing an unpopular religiously informed theocracy on a mad as hell Democratic and Independent majority who in a fucking midterm during a recession when the opposition controls both houses of Congress and the presidency voted on defiance of the party that should have been destroyed according to decades and decades of historical precedent.
Those 5 conservatives wrote a few words and, in consequence, handed Democrats campaign lightening in a bottle that defied historical precedent and will continue to do so, election after election, until abortion rights are cemented into law through legislative decree.
I would like to thank these emissaries of Gilead for energizing the wrath of a nation. See you in two years. Keep being you.
