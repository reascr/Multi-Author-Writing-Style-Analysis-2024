They'd undoubtedly support these things if their candidates did well, they're not coming around, they're just looking to pass blame for a little consolation, they don't really find these things unappealing, they're just upset that enough voters did.
So a lot of conservatives are turning on these candidates, on Trump, on election denying, on Christian nationalism, extreme, anachronistic policies, but they voted for these candidates, for these ideas, they're only lashing out because they lost.
True but maybe Republicans will think twice about knocking all of their sane candidates out since so many crazies lost otherwise winnable races this election.
It’s not like Republicans have been a party of solid values who fumbled their messaging. They spent tons of money, all the media and candidates were in lockstep on all the same talking points… but what they are selling is dogshit and voters saw through it.
I had no reason to be excited by Biden when he became the nominee in 2020, but he’s been a better president than anyone going at least back to Clinton, and it’s only been 2 years. Assuming things stay the same, I’m not going to torpedo a successful president, but right wing shills will be all over the internet convincing the left we should do that.
