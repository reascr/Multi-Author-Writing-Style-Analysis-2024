The danger is Pakistan giving nukes/nuclear technology to unsavory parties in a "nothing to lose" scenario. Pakistan treats the scientist who helped North Korea/Iran's Nuclear program as a national hero.
Oh I know Pakistan already gave nukes to North Korea and Iran, the danger is that if pushed too hard, Pakistan will start giving nukes to non-state entities as a way of striking at "enemies" they don't have the nominal strenh to take on.
But knowing the leadership in the Pak military, it is the country MOST LIKELY to use it's nukes out of all the countries that have nukes.
They don't have ICBMs; so yeah in retaliation they might nuke some other country, but can't nuke mainland US.
I hope the other countries have contingencies for what happens to their nukes if they can't handle the terror they created right on their doorstep.
Regardless, thinking any country could sneak a nuke sub to the US coast without the USAs incredibly bloated military noticing it is pure fallacy.
Oh for sure, at least the US tells you in advance that they are going to invade your country based on false reports, letting its soldiers run rampant on your territory.
