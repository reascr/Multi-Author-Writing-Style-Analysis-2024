Its definitely possible and I have no idea what comes after Putin. There are different groups of people who may not be happy with Putin inside of Russia, but none can openly say that. Those who are more extreme than Putin are extremely worrying. Their propaganda is allowed inside of Russia so long as they don't criticize Putin. People who may be against the war probably don't feel comfortable voicing that opinion to many, and it could be more difficult for them to organize against the regime.
Lavrov, Peskov, and other Kremlin officials who are commonly quoted in Western media are not likely as close to Putin as they appear. This is also true of at least most Russian oligarchs. Putin's real inner circle appears to have become very small during covid.
Nikolai Patrushev and Alexander Bortnikov are two people everyone should know more about, but are rarely mentioned in Western media. I have no idea in terms of a successor to Putin. Most of the obvious options including Lavrov are 70+ years old. If Putin has any input into his successor, then he probably wants someone younger.
Most likely, Patrushev will become Putin's successor. However, Ramzan Kadyrov and Prigozhin are also aiming for the place of successor. By the way, Medvedev will not be a successor either. He is an alcoholic who no longer has power in the government.
