Part A) State courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the state constitution or other state laws. Federal Courts have a constitutional duty to see if the law (redistricting) violates the Federal Constitution.
There is nothing in the constitution giving judges the authority to draw district boundaries by appointing special masters.
The fact remains, there is nothing in the constitution (not sure ab out NC law) given the judicial branch legislative powers (pass a redistricting law).
The NC SC found a map by NC legislature unconstitutional (with the NC Constitution). This is normal judicial review and is hardly the first time courts then drew a redistricting map. Legislatures should have to follow their own states' Constitution, and I hope you agree with that sentence.
Please give me the section of the constitution (federal or state) that gives courts this authority? Doesn't exist in the Federal Constitution. If state lawmakers put it in their state constitution, then by all means they have the authority. otherwise the court can do jack shit other than say the redistricting law is unconstitutional and can't go into effect.
