However: remember that the comment my original comment replied to was about the concept of reimbursing Brazil for slowing deforestation. So I mentioned an example of it in practice, as well as an example of it being used to pressure the Brazilian government when they didnâ€™t meet targets.
Which countries try to counteract by paying the Brazilian government money for slowing deforestation.
Most Deforestation in Brazil isn't due to companies, it is done ilegaly by thugs, the remaining is the example I just gave you..
It's not cattle, the industry that spearheads the deforestation in the amazons are the illegal logging operations. Down the line some idk how many years they may turn into crops for cattle.
The deforested areas are for raising cattle. Then after five years they will be able to farm corn and after seven years soybeans.
So they either want space for cattle or they are trying to increase the production of soybeans but the outcome is only in seven years. The farmers want the land for themselves just because they can. That's the main motivation.
