And before you say "fertilisers", keep in mind Brazil can easily become (and will become according to Lula himself) self-sufficient on that and, on the other hand, as one of the largest markets for fertilisers, also holds that as a bargaining chip over Russia.
If the West (that the people in r/Brasil have recently decided they do not belong to, apparently - the tankie brigading there does not stop) did not collectively back Lula on a few weeks ago, you would have had a fucking coup in Bras√≠lia.
Sure, but here is where Lula's personal feelings might come into play: He's super stoked about the whole BRICS thing and having a sort of Third Worldist (+Russia) bloc of countries which can oppose the European Union and the United States.
This does not justify Russia invading another country and tossing bombs into cities, but it explains why Brazil's whole diplomatic apparatus (and not just Lula) are not super gung-ho about opposing Russia. Russia is far away and too weak to interfere in South America, they're not "our problem".
