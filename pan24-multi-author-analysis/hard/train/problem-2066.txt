There is an interesting book, "How Civil Wars Start" by Barbara Walter (not Walters .). She's a political scientist who studies civil war. She lays out some criteria that often lead to civil war (and mentions that civil wars are less about geographical divisions than they are ideological or other divisions.
And she does make a point that in many civil wars people think "no way that would happen here" up until the moment it starts.
Personally, if there's going to be another civil war, then we've anyway seen what it looks like. Individual armed demonstrations. The next Civil War is America vs domestic terrorists.
FWIW political violence and full-blown civil war are two very different things. I'm afraid we likely will see a fair bit of the former in the US, but only very fringe groups truly want the latter.
I think we’re looking at more right wing terrorism for the moment. But what’s left of the mainstream GOP needs to stop feeding these assholes. It’s like none of them learned anything from the crowd shouting for Pence’s head on the 6th. These people eat their own.
