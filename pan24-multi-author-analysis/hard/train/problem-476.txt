Sadly the only way to protect everyone’s abortion rights is for the Federal Government to codify it, something that won’t happen with Republicans/Conservatives having control of either Congress and a SCOTUS that is mostly in their pocket.
Sadly, the only way to protect abortion rights is for the people to keep electing those who will keep protecting abortion rights, including, and especially, those who nominate and confirm people to the judiciary.
Codifying a right to abortion nationally is that much easier and people aren't idiots, they know that if things continue to swing right with the current day manifestation of the GOP that they will not stop at abortion and it will only be a harder fight. It will absolutely effect the run off, of course it will - people are emotional creatures, the fact that the right just got fucking spanked over trying to take us back to the last century and are still going hard for trying to pass laws that are going to kill women is what takes precedence.
It's actually kind of silly to think it won't. Since when is the public perfectly rational? How will this put a damper on an already red hot enthusiasm amongst dems in Georgia exactly?
