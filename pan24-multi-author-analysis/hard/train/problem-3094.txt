It's not like the Soviet Union that Regan fought against collapsed in the early 90's and the "evil empire" since has been dismantled and scattered into a half dozen separate countries. Almost like it's not even close to the same thing and global politics have changed over 40 years.
Officials in Washinon have warned that “Ukraine fatigue” among allies could worsen if Kyiv continues to be closed to negotiations, the Washinon Post reported. US officials told the paper that Ukraine’s position on negotiations with Russia is wearing thin among allies who are worried about the economic effects of a protracted war.
As far as the US is concerned this war advances US national interests, is great business for US defense firms, and time is on their side while Russia bleeds. This narrative that the US is going to get tired of supporting Ukraine doesn't even make sense, unless the GOP gets really excited for more self-sabotage on an international stage.
Don't know about the Republicans party platform now but many right wing parties in Europe have been receiving lots of suport just for blaming about everything on the Ukraine war and its suport. So as long as the war and the suport go on the right wingers will keep on abusing that situation to their advantage.
Looking at Europe, now that Corona is getting less relevant, blaming everything on the Ukraine war has been about the only party platform of some right wing parties. And worst thing is, that in some cases they were quite successful with it. So yeah, I do see the situation in Ukraine very much influencing the political scene.
Public sentiment is already shifting in Russia, Putin will back down without conquering Ukraine. You are delusional.
