It might be because they were allowed to pump more then what was originally allowed for the pipeline.
An arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation oversees pipeline safety and permitted TC Energy to have greater pressures on the Keystone system because the company used pipe made from better steel.
According to the US Department of Transportation, pipelines are the safest way to transport energy. Statistics from the National Transportation Safety Board show pipelines make up less than one one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%) of all transportation accidents in the U.S.. Safer for people and the environment.
Different pipeline but within the Keystone portfolio. A side note, no major media report on the multiples of train derailments carrying oil. Because pipeline leaks are rare, they get more coverage.
Sorry about that. Yeah I missed that and now I'm to lazy to go find the US gov data. The demand for oil will be consistent for many years.
I do hope we continue to find safer replacements for oil and gas. Until we do, the safest transportation should be allowed.
