There were two bills. One that required the rail workers to work under the agreed wage increase agreed by the workers and 8/12 of the unions and another bill to give the rail workers paid sick leave.
But, of course, it was Biden's fault... Definitely not the Republicans that voted for the corporations and deny the workers simple paid sick leave.
Why isn't anyone upset about every GOP house rep voting against the 2020 bill enshrining paid leave for all full time workers? How about the Senate GOP filibustering the same bill? Democratic reps and senators overwhelmingly supported those.
That failed bill, and many before it, lets essential industries like rail and trucking continue to avoid paying for reasonable sick leave.
Which then would have resulted in a strike which would have been catastrophic for the economy forcing the rail road companies to the table or forcing Republicans to pass the bill with sick leave. Forcing a contract on the union and taking away their right to strike is morally repugnant. By splitting it into two bills the Democrats knew this would happen. Ultimately they didn't think railroad worker sick leave was worth actually fighting for.
