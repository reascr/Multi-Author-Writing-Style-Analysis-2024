That's an interesting article. My first instinct is that, if an AI gets trained on an artist's work, the artist should get royalties for things the AI produces.
Ok, but I would say if a company makes money off of AIs trained on artists, it would be reasonable for that company to at least give royalties to those living artists.
Mm, I think one of the few benefits of corporate power is that protecting their own rights to copyright also is accidentally protecting individual's copyrights. : ) So at least as things stand I think that will stay protected.
But yes, agree that it's going to be a mess for a while. Here's hoping for the most rational solution that benefits the original artists being used for the models, and art in general, while everyone gets to use these tools to unleash their own creativity.
It's way too simplistic to assume that artists are somehow only capable of creating things that are derivative of others' styles, and in this case, the AI art is directly emulating others' styles, not even coming up with its own. Are you an artist? A lot of learning consists of slamming paint around until it looks like something and refining your own randomness, not copying others at all. Real artists learn actual technique and materials skill, and principles of art, and put these to use instead of "learning" by chopping up existing art and making a collage out of it like AI is doing.
