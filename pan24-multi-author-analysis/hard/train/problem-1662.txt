Current best estimate says that . That'd be 5.6 million Americans. But if you check the details of that study, you'll see that 5.1% of everyone under 30 identifies as trans. Why the mismatch? Many older trans people "go stealth," and disappear from the queer community, never mentioning their trans identities again. Many, many more don't know they're trans yet, or are repressing it. As a result, the actual proportion of the population that is probably trans is better represented by that cross-section of younger people.
17.5 million Americans. An American political candidate for president just proposed the wholesale extermination of 17.5 million American citizens.
Imagine the government exterminating 3.5 million people. That death toll would be 4 times larger than the amount of Tutsi killed in the Rwandan Genocide. That doesn't even include doctors, family members, allies, cisgender drag queens and other groups. Without even touching the non-drag LGB population, this genocidal worst case scenario could kill or displace close to five million people. That number is slightly below the total population of New Zealand. Trans people might be a small percentage of the American population but with how big our population is, that still means millions are in the crosshairs.
We could be heading towards this future if we don't act quickly and decisively. 2024 is only two years away.
People hear need to understand just how far this plan goes. Not only does Trump call for a total ban on all gender affirming care for minors, he also does the same for "all ages" meaning adults and also would hunt and arrest doctors who do provide gender-affirming care. And we all know that these people have no problem calling for the deaths of trans people as well, that's why they send bomb threats to children's hospitals.
