GLSDB can be either GBU-39As or GBU-39Bs. 39As would be plenty for Ukraine still, as that's a rocket that can still strike a stationary target from roughly 100 miles out with a CEP of just 5 meters. Warhead is the same as a M31, but with twice the range.
SOF calls in strike package, confirms they will paint the target, GLSDB is fired, GBU-39B locks onto SOF's laser, boom. Literally no different than the average strike package called in by a NATO JTAC today.
Even with GBU-39Bs, Ukrainian forces could simply use laser designators to paint for the weapon, literally exactly like how RAF Eurofighters tend to conduct strike packages in groups of 2, with one lasing for the other. Hell, makes more sense than having the weapon self laze, as the GBU-39 has no target selection capabilities of its own...
Alot of the success with GMLRS is that they can pretty easily saturate any possible missle defense with like a dozen missles. But ATACMS your always launching a much smaller number of missiles that will spend a longer time in the air.
If I were to bet Iâ€™d say air launched cruise missiles are first, with range exceeding ATACMs. Storm Shadow/SCALP has been rumored to be adapted till Ukrainian SU-24 attack jets, just like the HARM was adapted to UA fighters earlier. That would put a lot of RU territory at risk.
