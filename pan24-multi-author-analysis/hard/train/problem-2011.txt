I'm a gay dude living in GA. Moved here 18 years ago. In 30 days I'll begin the process of leaving the State. This is due to MTG and Kemp along with a lot of other xenophobia. Portland, OR here I come.
I've vacationed in OR when I used to live in Seattle. I've been down to Portland a couple of times, but the city is just a bit too hectic for my taste. I'd love to move to OR at some point and live on the water in some small, unsuspecting town. Low traffic and picturesque sunsets are what I'd want.
Oh so I'm a misogynist because I don't appreciate some random tool barging in and spouting some of the most annoying rhetoric on this website? Are you that insecure that you immediately result to calling someone a misogynist whenever your fragile, shitty talking points aren't appreciated? Oh I apologize, I guess I'm "mansplaining" to you right now. I can't wait to be brought up in some 12,000 word manifesto posted to r/TwoXChromosomes about how men on this website are so horrible and never treat women with the respect they deserve.
As they should. Elected officials should be held to a much higher standard of speech compared to civilians. Greene and Boebert need to be arrested ASAP.
