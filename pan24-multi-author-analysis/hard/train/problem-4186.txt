This is the era of satellites where anything on the ground can be assumed to have been imaged from space. If this is a Chinese spy balloon imaging US soil, then the US has nothing to worry about because anything the spy balloon images the Chinese could already see with their satellites.
So by setting a precedent of shooting the Chinese balloon, they'd probably open their own spy balloons over China and Russia to be shot down as well.
LOL… ok. Alright, ok. Let’s say it’s a surveillance balloon… if the west has them already deployed, why shouldn’t the east? If we’re all watching each other, then nobody can do anything that the other doesn’t know about, and the need for secrecy is moot and we can become cooperative instead of adversarial. I don’t get the whole “they’re bad, we’re good even if we’re all doing the same shit” philosophy. It’s antiquated. People are fucking stupid. Russia and China and the US especially.
This balloon has nothing to do with spying. If they wanted to spy, they already have satellites for that.
