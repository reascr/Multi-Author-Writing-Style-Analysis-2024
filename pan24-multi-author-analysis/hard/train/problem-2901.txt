Don't listen to this guy. Our PM said that a lot of balkan people sympathise with russia, not that western balkans are on russian side. Slovenian government and people stance is anti putin. There are just more pro-putin people here that rest of europe due to slavic heritage, that doesn't mean that we are all pro-putin.
Most of us Croatians don't share his sentiment in regard to Ukraine, and we are highly supportive of them.
So I think that if anyone has relevant opinion on this, and can really sympathise with Ukraine, its Croatia.
Something is not right here… this is very opposite of the Croatian people and government’s stance to support European values and EU/ NATO partners. In addition, we remember what it was like to have our country invaded- homes destroyed, lives lost and land stolen.
This was a vote held for military training to take place in Croatia as part of the EU mission and not at all related to supplying of aid. This vote failed because not enough members were present at the time of voting and it looks like based on the numbers of those who did it would have.
Croatia is a popular yachting destination and we impound and monitor yachts that are listed for sanctioned Russian individuals. So doubt we are seeing any influx or loophole of this. The problem is though what do you continue to do with those yachts and what about those that are not on the sanctioned lists… it’s a little trickier than a travel visa ban if you look at it like that.
