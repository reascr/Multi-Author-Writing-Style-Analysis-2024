That's why ome country, I think it's sweden?, Actually has clinics where someone who wants to do heroin can go and do it in a sanitary environment with a clean needle. They will offer them rehab of they want, but not force it.
Sometimes all it takes for someone is recognizing that others want to help them which is what mandated rehab is. It's a better use of money then policing their drug use.
No, criminalizing drugs to curb use didn't work. People kept doing them and then they were also taxed with criminal records which made rebounding even harder. What I'm talking about is focused on recovering drug addicts, not hurdling more barriers at them.
The big problem the author notes with needle exchanges is that most are not associated with addiction treatment.
All this is doing is making it so those who are addicted are no longer going to be arrested for their addiction. I think we can both agree that's an objective win, right?
No it doesn't? It's still incredibly illegal to sell or traffick drugs. All that's changing here is that it's no longer illegal to possess small amounts of drugs. If you have a quantity of drugs in your possession that is a sellable amount, changing depending on what drug specifically it is, you can and will be arrested for it.
