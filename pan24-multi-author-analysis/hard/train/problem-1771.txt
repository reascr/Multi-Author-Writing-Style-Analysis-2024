Only if Ukraine give up Crimea and Donbas, because Russia considered those 2 regions theirs and it's also internationally and legally part of Ukraine.
If Ukraine joins NATO and invokes article 5 claiming Crimea is under attack, it will automatically trigger World War 3. NATO members aren't stupid, they know what it would mean if Ukraine joins NATO.
As of right now, Germany approved to send heavy tanks into Ukraine. They import zero gas or oil from Russia and are one of the top European supporters of Ukraine. It‘s pretty clear where Germany stands on the issue. Where is your evidence?
Tanks coming a year too late? Bro the war started in February 20th, it‘s not even been a year yet. Oh and the question if Germany would send soldiers? Yeah pretty sure they would. They did after 9/11 and that was in fucking Afghanistan. It‘s not far fetched to believe that Germany would support a neighboring country when under the threat of invasion. Stop being a spiteful Germany hating German and check some facts.
So where is your evidence for Germany not being an unreliable ally? Right you don’t, you are just talking crap. Germany has shown now multiple times it values Gasprom over their partners.
When shit hits the fan nobody thinks Germany or France are reliable. History has proven that every single time.
