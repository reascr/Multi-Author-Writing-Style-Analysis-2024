... and they won't have any explanation why these soviet-era nukes that haven't been maintained would miraculously be able to get past state-of-the-art anti-missle defenses.
Seeing how most of their military is leftover soviet era junk that hasn't been well maintained, I'd be more worried about Russia becoming ash due to their nukes exploding on attempt to launch.
No, the results are pretty imaginable: a much better interception rate for Russian missiles, meaning fewer blown up schools, hospitals, and power stations.
On one hand these are old technology & will have no impact on Russian air capabilities, on the other hand giving Ukraine these defensive weapons will have "unimaginable results." If they won't be effective why would Russia escalate a war with the United States. I'm betting the systems are old tech & more than capable of shooting down what Russia sends Ukraine's way.
If enough countries tell Russia to GTFO of Ukraine, it may eventually help tip the scales. To receive the messages, Russia has to be there.
Russia provides a vital counterweight to China in Asia. At least, they used to. Not so much anymore.
The U.N. is there for opposing countries to talk and yell at each other. It is not a group of friends or an alliance.
