Recent polls have them statistically tied for the '24 GOP presidential primary winner, but, hey, Ron and Don, don't let that stop y'all, you keep on picking at each other, DNC commercials can use the stock footage in a year or so.
The link seems to hang for me without showing any results. 538 shows DeSantis leading in some polls, and Trump in others, basically a wash at this point.
Most polls I’ve seen have it at nearly 50/50 between trump/not trump. The thing is that Desantis doesn’t get all of the not trump votes, so trump has a huge lead.
If trump and DeSantis run against each other the best thing would be for trump to narrowly lose to DeSantis. Trump will rail that DeSantis stole it from him and his supporters will either protest vote against DeSantis, or trump will run 3rd party guaranting a dem win.
If Trump were smart he'd sink Desantis's reelection campaign so if Desantis tried to run in 2024 Trump can just call him a loser.
Sounds like 2016 to me and in the end they got behind Trump. Trump lost 2020 because of him being him. DeSantis doesn't have any of that baggage at this moment in time. I can easily see MAGA getting behind DeSantis like Republicans did in 2016 w/ Trump.
