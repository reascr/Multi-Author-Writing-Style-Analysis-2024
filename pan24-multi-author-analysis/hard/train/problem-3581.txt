while I agree for planes, you can replace a large share of electricity and energy generation with nuclear power or other green options.
I agree, would also like to add that even if you produce electricity/hydrogen from gas, BEVs and hydrogen cars are still way more efficient than gas powered cars.
Yes, liquid hydrogen is actually several times more energy dense than jet fuel. It is a substitute that has a lot of promise. The problem is that it comes with its own set of engineering problems and aircraft companies have had generations to work out all the bugs with using fossil fuels. It also requires its own infrastructure that practically no airports are renovating to be able to support. There also isn't any government support for specifically the aerodynamics industry yet (although the 2022 IRA act extends some tax credits and applies new ones to Hydrogen fuel cell investment and hydrogen production investment). Still, it is unlikely existing subsidies will be enough to close the gap in cost between running a plane on fossil fuels vs hydrogen.
