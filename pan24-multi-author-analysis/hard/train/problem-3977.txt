Doesn't matter. Blood is on the hands of the consumers. Enjoy your Nike's and iPhones. No one cares anyway.
not if the management and CEO weren't collecting an ungodly amount for maximizing profits by sourcing slave labor.
I wonder what happens when Apple runs out of underdeveloped countries that can manufacture their products at slave wage labor status?
What does having a retail apple store in a country have to do with manufacturing phones in that country?
Also people on reddit need to stop casually throwing around the word 'slave labour'. The wages are far lower than in developed countries, sure, but the conditions are still far better than the smaller, companies, but more importantly, working in an apple factory will be WAYY better than working in the unorganised sector, from where employment is transferred to the organised sector when large companies set up factories. Then there is the issue of seasonal unemployment and pseudo employment, which are also addressed by these.
The manufacturing is VERY welcomed locally as it creates legal jobs. A developing country needs to work at relatively lower wages in order to develop.
