Terrible wording - the actual word should be "cured", as in corrected because they were not machine readable (or were missing dates or signatures) but turned out to be valid ballots.
Curing only applies to mail-in ballots; presumably, problems with ballots cast in person on Election Day are fixed then.
To be fair, they did mention right after that, the majority of mail in ballots tend to be democratic voters and those are the ballots that require “curing”.
Why this matters is: Nationwide more democrats vote by mail so people are hoping that as more mail in ballots get cured it will mean more democratic votes. However, in CO, a state with 100% distribution of mail in ballots, the more likely outcome is cured ballots equaling the democrat/republican distribution of the already counted ballots. So if 2000 ballots get cured, likely 1005 will be for Boebert and 995 for Frisch (to match the other percentages).
As a note: It was originally republicans that pushed for 100% mail in ballots in CO. There was a major storm that affected the mountain and rural areas of CO, cutting off those (mostly republican) voters from the pols on election day. Metro Denver (more democrats) did not have as serious weather and got to vote. Republicans, unhappy with the outcome of that election because they did not get to vote, pushed for a mail in voting system. And it has developed in to the best mail in system in country.
I think both sides have passionate supporters....considering they email you when your ballot is accepted, and email you if it is not accepted, all involved have the same information and same opportunity.
Regardless of how you feel about her (I have an opinion, but I will keep them to myself for this post) you need to understand: Every registered voter is mailed a ballot in CO. It is very rare to vote in person (I had to do it once, because I moved counties right around voting time. I had to go to the county seat and get a judge to sign off).
