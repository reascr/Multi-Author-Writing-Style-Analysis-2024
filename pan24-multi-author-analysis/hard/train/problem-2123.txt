DeSantis would absolutely beat Trump in a general election, but the problem for DeSantis is he will be running against Trump in a Republican primary, not a general election. I don't think DeSantis or anyone else has a chance of beating Trump in a Republican primary. DeSantis is still too afraid of Trump to publicly criticize him. We haven't yet seen a Republican publicly criticize Trump and survive politically. Even now after meeting with Kanye and Nick Fuentes and then saying the constitution should be terminated, Republicans are still unwilling to criticize Trump! He's going to be their nominee again.
Moderate Republicans absolutely want to move on from Trump, but moderate Republicans are a very small part of the Republican party. Just look at how the GOP primaries went all across the country this year if you have any questions about where the GOP voting base still is.
If he’s the GOP candidate, a staggeringly significant chunk of the country will still vote for him. The GOP isn’t evolving past horrible candidates (or Trump in particular), they’re just confused about what their best move is at this point.
Honestly though, I think all the DeSantis talk is really moot though, as I don't think he can beat Trump in a primary. Trump fans like DeSantis because he's like Trump, but they're still going to vote for the original rather than the knockoff version. And DeSantis has yet to ever say anything disparaging about Trump publicly, which shows how afraid he is of Trump. At some point a prominent Republican in office is going to have to publicly criticize Trump if they ever want to beat him, and thus far not one has even tried to do so. It's gonna be Trump with the GOP nomination in 2024.
I still think it's Trump. He still has the plurality of support and that's all that's needed to win the primary. Could that change in the next 2 years? Sure. I just don't see them managing to pony up anyone who could beat Trump in a primary. The whole country =/= Florida.
