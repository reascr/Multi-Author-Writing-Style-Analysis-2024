When I used facebook, i didn't have lizardman staring at me every once in a while, just because he's the man. Because...facebook isn't about him. And twitter sure as heck didn't use to be and really isn't about Musk.
Those tweets don’t say anything about ITAR. They state Musk’s purported reason for holding back on Starlink deployment, which was fear of escalating the conflict.
I'd be guessing musk doesn't exactly want his satellites targeted by militaries either and taken out of commission..
Because I don't think the drones they are using can actually even connect to a heavily encrypted military satellite. Imagine the security nightmare trying to figure out who is who trying to access the space lazers.
Or maybe he could....I dunno, ask? Honestly if he has launched the entire Starlink system into space, I'm sure he has a phone number he can call to either have consent or confirm an actual violation. He could have it cleared up in a day tops, but he didn't because that's not why he made the choice.
His official statement was that not letting Ukraine use it for drones, is preventing Zelensky from attacking Russian soil and starting WW3.
