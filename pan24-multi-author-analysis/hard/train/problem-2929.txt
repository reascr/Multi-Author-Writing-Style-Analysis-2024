No one has explained to me, logically how gay marriage affects the family dynamic. Gay people are not going to marry straight, at least not without a lot of suffering and ultimately a bad marriage.
Lots of people hate LGBT folks (who are not actually responsible for their own oppression). Politicians like votes so they tap into this negative energy to keep their jobs.
Wow. Nope.Not my intent at all. If I may, your.comment is a little wrapped up in itself. This is how I'd like to unwrap it.
When said politician is shown to be demonstrably hypocritical, people giggle because said politician was doing something they said they were against.
A lot of times the politicians are bigots, sometimes they are not. Mostly they just like power and it is easy to have power when you are preaching (intentional word choice) against a minority. This group is not a physical threat to you because they have fewer numbers than your group. Cavemanath 101.
The important thing is why people giggle. Well, I don't know, but I perceive this is because society in many countries has gotten to the point where people accept LGBT folks(there is a lot of room to improve, mind you). So when they giggle, people are really thinking " wow, that dude is a liar" rather than, "that dude is gay, screw him".
If this was meant earnestly, no, you're just passing the buck for bigoted straight people onto "closeted gays". Quit doing this fucking shit, it's disgusting.
