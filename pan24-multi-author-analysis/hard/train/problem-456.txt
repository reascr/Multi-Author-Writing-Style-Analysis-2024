>They fly closer to earth and drift with wind patterns, which are not as predictable to militaries and intelligence agencies as the fixed orbits of satellites, and they can evade radar. They can also hover over areas, while satellites are generally in constant motion. Simple cameras on balloons can produce clearer images than those on orbital satellites, and other surveillance equipment can pick up signals that do not reach the altitude of satellites.
"While the balloon was still in the air, American U-2 surveillance planes took images of it to determine its capabilities, the department said in a statement, adding that the balloon’s equipment “was clearly for intelligence surveillance and inconsistent with the equipment on board weather balloons.”.
Early in the Biden administration: they undertook an evaluation of all UFO type incidents and this review, coupled with other US espionage activity allowed them to identify the prior incidents and roughly plot the flights other balloons had taken.
Another balloon was ID’d during the Biden administration but I don’t know where that fits in the timeline— whether that balloon was identified after the fact (along with the Trump balloons) or if that was the catalyst that led to the UFO review or what.
Sometime during Trump administration: Balloons were flown into US territory but US either didn’t notice them or they were briefly spotted and categorized as “UFO”.
I don’t know when this balloon got on the government’s “radar” but unlike the others it only appears to have been publicly noticed .
Or, you know, contacting US authorities like the FAA to explain that they had an errant balloon to keep an eye on.
I think it’s unlikely to have been going on that long because balloon technology was not advanced enough for such long flights until fairly recently. Even this balloon appears far larger and the payload far heavier than what Google was doing for long-term flights.
