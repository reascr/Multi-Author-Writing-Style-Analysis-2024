That is so strange. My middleschool in the 90s had a "Mr Heartthrob" contest. It was kind of like a beauty contest but it was us boys dressing up as women. There were football players wearing their girlfiends cheerleading uniforms, a couple dressed as one of the elderly teachers (that was hilarious), and I wore my mom's jazz dancing skirt, complete with balloons for breasts.
Not sure why I ranted about this except to say, people sure like to be upset over shit that shouldn't even bother them. These adults that want to feel attacked and offended and victimized and control other people so their feelings don't get hurt, or as some sort of punishment on others from their repressed feelings is absurd and the hate needs to stop. These people are acting worse than children (during the age that children are usually their worst) I think that's my point.
Also no idea why you generalize about bullies being the product of just bad parenting. That is not the only cause.
I just googled why uniforms are good, I know that in my country that was the main reasons all schools required uniforms, kids living in extreme poverty benefited from government subsidies for them, and didn't have to miss school because of lack of clothing.
Sure, maybe I didn't explain my point, I'm not saying uniforms eliminate bullying in general, but they help equalize the field for those children who cannot afford new or branded clothes from those who can.
Also, while I do agree that uniforms probably do reduce bullying, let's not mislead other readers about what is the main reason for bullying.
While that night be true, it's been proven that uniforms actually level the playing field between students, prevents bullying and reduces peer pressure. Not to mention is cheaper for families that can't afford new clothes every year.
