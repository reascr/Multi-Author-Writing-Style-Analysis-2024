Lastly the range is short for the distances for many here. Just to get groceries I’m making my range. If I want to tow or go to city over 30k I’m beyond the range, and don’t have any charging stations in the are. Until we get that gap closed it’s entirely impractical. Also if you have any issues the closest place to work on a vehicle is a 4 hr round trip.
Lack of 4x4 options, for me, is a major setback. There needed here, same with towing payload. At minimum a 8500lb towing capacity would be needed. The current offerings for EV don’t meet this need yet. The lightning is close, but not quite yet.
Same my good chum. If they can make a reliable cost effective portable solar generator I can set in a camp and get charging stations in more remote areas I’d be game to switch one of my household rigs to EV. Until then Im stuck with gas and diesel.
Diesels are dumb as fuck by comparison. Maintain cylinder pressure and fuel deliverand you’re basically set.
Repairing a diesel is much easier to do if we get blasted back to the Stone Age, you just need some dumb components that rarely need specialized techniques and/or tools to manufacture. A screw driver and a wrench can get you 99% of the way there.
Same with the person farther up that said “with a diesel if you’ve got a screwdriver and a wrench you can fix a diesel”.
