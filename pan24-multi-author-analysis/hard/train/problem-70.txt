Because it’s not a 401k. It’s a safety net for all Americans. We are not going to let the fools that opt out and then go broke just starve and die. So no everybody pays.
It doesn't have to be instead, and in most cases it isn't. Pensions are much more like 401Ks than Social Security. You really are ignoring the whole social safety net aspect of the thing here aren't you...
Ignoring the safety net aspect? No. I don't want it. I'm planning my retirement as if Social Security will not be available to me at all. If I could opt out and invest my SS privately in addition to my current contribution, I'd have a substantial nest egg and a strong safety net at 59 1/2. I don't want to retire at 70 and be terrorized by politicians every 2-4 years while they use my money as reelection fodder.
Nope. You'd be completely off the hook. I would not be allowed to collect one red cent if I didn't pay in. I'll either self-finance my retirement or rely on family or charity.
Public pensions are invested in the stock market. If it's so bad, why aren't teachers and police officers demanding to be enrolled in Social Security instead?
