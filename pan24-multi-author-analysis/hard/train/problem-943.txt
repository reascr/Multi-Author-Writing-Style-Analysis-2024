The reactor wasn’t even designed to be a coastal reactor it was designed for the US Midwest plains. A modern coastal reactor with an active sea wall would have not been an issue. It will be like Chernobyl and also be a black eye even if it was a one off event. One pellet (about the size of an eraser) of Uranium is equal to one 1 ton of coal, 147 gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. The energy density and zero emissions are what we need for the future of the planet.
"Most kinds of renewable energy are also “carbon-free”: they do not emit CO2 or other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Because of this, and because renewables like wind and solar power are so popular in climate activism, the terms “renewable energy” and “carbon-free energy” are sometimes confused. But not all renewable energy is carbon-free, and not all carbon-free energy is renewable.
Other renewables aren't carbon free either. They also require mining of toxic chemicals, and creating them takes energy as well, which today is supplied by fossil fuels.
And every energy source produces toxic waste. Coal and natural gas release its waste into the atmosphere, and spent batteries, spent solar cells, GaAs integrated circuits, turbine lubricants, and everything else all go to a landfill or into the ocean. Nuclear isn't unique there, only except that radiation is scarier than other forms of poisoning.
And the reason nuclear is stagnant is because people are unjustifiably scared of it. Nuclear is a great resource as part of a mix of energy generation along with solar and wind.
And accepting the value of nuclear does not take away from the value of solar and wind. The fact remains that if we'd invested in nuclear energy 10-20 years ago, we'd be seeing the reduction in emissions that we need today instead of the growing issues we actually have, and it was fearmongering like yours that prevented it.
