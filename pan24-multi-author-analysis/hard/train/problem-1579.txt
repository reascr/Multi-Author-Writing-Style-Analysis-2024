Iron dome and Patriots are meant for different defense system ranges. Iron dome is a point defense system like a higher version of C-RAM or the U.S.â€™ Centurion system. That is meant to defend against lower flying objects. You need a few to defend a city. Where upon Patriot system can cover 300km to 1000km area. It's meant to defend against ballistic missiles and upper atmospherics.
Except no amount of air supremacy is going to prevent a couple of schmucks with guns, artillery, and missiles, from hitting a target.
Air supremacy would absolutely prevent a couple of schmucks from doing a lot of things. Artillery warfare as seen in Ukraine become impossible with air supremacy. I mostly agree with the other guy, but the US also invests in air defense, considering we have Patriots, THAAD, Aegis, NASAMs and C-RAMs, which can handle the artillery and missiles bit, the last of which is the ideal for handling drones like Shaheds.
Also America is basically leading the entire military over there, and when the country setting up how the military works is literally an ocean away and has near zero risk of being hit by aircraft the military in Europe is not going to be super heavily funding air defense.
If European countries got into the game better and started putting real funding into their own local militaries they would see the vulnerable population centers all around them, see that the United States isn't super invested in defending them, and they would have had worthwhile air defense.
