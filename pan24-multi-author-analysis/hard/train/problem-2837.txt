Yep. It's unfortunate all these "crisis at the border!" Republicans can't just look at England and see the way racist border policies demolished that country's economy and think of it as a teachable moment here in America, but unfortunately their bigotry outweighs everything else. These same people screaming about immigrants are the same ones talking about and to fill all the jobs we can't seem to otherwise fill. The truth is we need immigrants to help replenish the but all people like Empty G can see is "too many brown-skinned people".
It's always bizarre to me when people refer to things people did or said decades ago like that's who they currently are. Trump used to donate money to Democrats, but that doesn't mean he supports them now.
The only times Biden voted to go to war with Iraq was at the behest of Republican administrations, and the second time it was because of deliberate lies told to him and the world by Republicans. Lately he's the one responsible for getting us out of that war, which to me seems more currently relevant than something he thought thirty years ago.
Did America invade Iraq in 1998 when Democrats had the White House? No. Did America invade Iraq on two separate occasions when Republicans were in the White House? Yes.
Agreed. A lot of people who espouse secession as a viable solution seem to not realize that there are a lot of impoverished, queer, BIPOC, <insert minority here.
