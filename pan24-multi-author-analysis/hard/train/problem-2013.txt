And as much as Cippollone and Hershmann and Cohen probably suck as human beings, they undoubtedly knew exactly what was happening, and i'd categorize their behavior at that specific moment in time as courageous.
Think about the White House meeting on December 15 when they had Cohen in there, and then Cippollone and Herschmann and Clark. It was supposed to be the meeting where Trump got Cohen to resign, and then they went over their plans to use Clark to order the military to seize voting machines in swing states, and do some sort of recount, which, of course would just be basically stealing the election. And then the pushback was that Trump was informed that the entire justice department was going to resign and protest, and he balked. That was his moment where he basically chickened out... and where the plot officially entered being hopeless.
It's still going to be an inflection point. They can't just press that button and just walk off into the sunset like that. Every single person in this country who pays attention to politics is going to know exactly what they did. And then they're asking people just to say 'that's fine, might as well just go about our day.'.
I’m just saying. Its a bit hypocritical on the lefts part. Especially the fact that PRIVATELY owned small businesses were ransacked across the nation. Compared to “storming” the capitol building, that is paid for by our tax dollars.
