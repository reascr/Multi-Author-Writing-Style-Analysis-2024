I’d be surprised if they even get that. Seeing some of the sentencing going on these days, makes it seem like murder isn’t a big deal anymore unless there is public outcry.
Also what system is in place for murderers paying restitution, I agree that would be excellent but it hasn’t happened. In the case that it does they still should serve at least ten years, they can do prison work for restitution. Anything less than ten is way too soft and you’re going to have people thinking it’s not such a bad penalty. Also cops tend to get significantly less sentences than the precedent if at all, with time served being even less than the sentence: so whatever you set keep that in mind. Do you want cops running around getting off with a few months time served on murders?
Why does a murderer deserve rehab? Over 60 percent (63.8%) of violent offenders recidivated by being rearrested for a new crime. So how many of them murdered this man? Do the math and you’re not just giving them a chance to commit another crime, it’s statistically guaranteed. This is a numbers game and when you go and put all these murderers back on the street without punishment, you want to basically bless and sanction the next murder? That’s a groovy cycle you’re arguing for: like I said in most of my comments in this thread. I advocate for rehab and against incarceration in almost all cases but you have to look at the realities of extremely violent crimes. To answer your question: it accomplishes keeping shitty people from murdering and ruining more innocent lives. Also saves many more because it deters others from murdering because no punishment makes the crime more appealing.
Don't you think the victim's family would be better off getting a percentage of all money the murderer makes for the rest of their life? Isn't that better than the "satisfaction" of knowing the murderer is behind bars?
