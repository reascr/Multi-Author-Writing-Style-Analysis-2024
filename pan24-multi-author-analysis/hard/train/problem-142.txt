I think democrats know that, and honestly don’t care. What is Sinema doing for them? She stifled that at every possible turn and doesn’t agree with their positions. This isn’t like Manchin where it’s as good as it gets. Kelly votes like a rank and file democrat and he cruised to an easy reelection. It’s probably better to just lose the seat and get a real democrat in 6 years.
Oh I know, and maybe the Dems can rile up enough hate for sinema that they can take the seat back. I'm mostly pointing out the reason sinema decided to come out as an independent is because she was completely fucked as a candidate if she remained a dem.
Republicans will win the seat if sinema splits moderate/dem leaning voters with any other candidate.
This could change if Republicans nominate a genuine centrist candidate though... but I highly doubt the Republican base would ever vote for a pragmatic centrist candidate.
I honestly think there is a decent chance now that she is more of a liability for Republicans than Dems, or draws voters evenly from both camps making her a nonentity.
The most realistic scenario is that Sinema and the Democrat split the non Republican vote, and a Republican will win with about 45-50% of the vote.
