Adding some additional rules like a 75 vote confirmation requirement and rules like "the Garland rule" which is a time limit on the Senate for voting on a nominee. If the nominee isn't voted on by the full senate within 3 months of being nominated he is automatically approved. Another necessary rule is the 2 strikes rule. If two nominees get shot down by the senate, then a randomly selected judge from the next lower court in the same party as the president is automatically promoted.
Edit: But I see the hole here. Yes, it should be amended to not allowing an automatic approval if the governing party of the Senate is the same as the president.
The only remedy is Impeachment/Removal, which is a political process, and only has a chance of happening if there is strong public support for it.
Also, along that vein, the maximum punishment allowable for an impeachment is removal from office. Maybe the two taken together merely give the impression that Congress can only impeach in response to a crime, without that impression being factually true.
â€¦which seems to say people in office who commit crimes must be removed from office if impeached, but does not say explicitly that impeachment can only be incurred in response to a crime.
It's also worth noting that two Justices faced impeachment: one in 1965 who resigned before impeachment proceedings could begin (for working as a paid consultant to someone accused of committing a crime), and one who was impeached by the House (and acquitted by the Senate) for political bias on the bench.
Look up the history of impeachment in the US, once upon a time even being suspect of impartiality (like being hyper-partisan) was considered a disqualifier - they never would've been nominated much less needed to be removed. Now the only judges republicans have nominated going back even before to Reagan are federalist society hacks.
