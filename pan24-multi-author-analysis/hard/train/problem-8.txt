I feel like a better way would be for China to stop making imperialist claims and threats and aiding other imperialist endeavors. People would probably care a lot less about spy balloons then.
So the US was just supposed to wave to the spy balloon? We can now fly similar spy equipment balloons over their military bases and they would point, smile and wave at it? Yes with Satellites, TicTok, Chinese home security systems, IOT, our own social media, phishing scams ect, there is no privacy breach already in place that a Chinese balloon made much worse. But seriously the Chinese warnings are like Trump tweets the hot air they fill these balloons with.
How about the Chinese government quit bitching about non-existent "escalations" and just stop flying balloons in other countries' airspaces?
This balloon fiasco already backfired hard in China's face because of their premature nonsensical accusation that the US flew balloons of its own over Tibet and Xinjiang.
Everything China does is mostly for domestic audiences, but this vitriol has consequences globally. It's absolutely mind blowing people in the CCP are reviewing these options and are going "yep, that's the way to go. This is ok." I'd be nervous lying on a resume. China is casually making stuff up that implies another country has been spying on them with similar things they're accused of first.
Also, where does that even put China on the competence scale? Now coming out the US is spying on you with balloons, and you didn't notice? Or you knew and you just let them spy?
