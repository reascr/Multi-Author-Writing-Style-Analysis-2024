This is really a beautiful thing! Also just the way that animals are treated and used for good in Ukraine.
Beautifully said and all true! I’m sorry about your friend. I’m glad we have dogs to help us out. Also happy for the dogs because they have a loving home.
Dogs are really wonderful. I've been sometimes falling into feelings of sadness over the loss of a younger friend who commited suicide and when I do one will shove a toy to play fetch with at me and the other come for snuggles. I just realized the pattern recently but they've been doing it for a while now I realize. It snaps me out of it and I feel better.
I met a guy who had some bad PTSD from his time in Iraq and his wife.He'd barely been able to leave the house before he got his therapy dog. And she made a world of difference to him. They were all able to go out with their child and do happy family things again. When he'd start to get anxious the dog would lean into him or push her head at him for pets. It just changes something in your brain and your thoughts and dogs notice how you are feeling before people ever could. I think they probably smell it. Either that or they are just magical creatures that can read our thoughts before we even can? Take your pick. ; ) But it's really great for those kids. They really deserve and need all the love and support they can get.
