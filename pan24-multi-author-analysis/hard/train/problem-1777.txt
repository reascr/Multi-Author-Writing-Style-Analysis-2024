No, unfortunately not. An invasion of NK is out of the question because it would immediately trigger war with China. The other issue is the nukes. I often get the impression that a lot of Redditors don't understand what nuclear war anywhere means for them.
Of course but in the realm of geopolitics, SK being a democracy means they have to think about support for any war they get into. That's why the US lost in Vietnam despite never losing a single substantial engagement.
China isn't going to invade anybody, it's going to do exactly what it did the first time around. They won't take over NK because, A: it would be too late once the nukes started flying and B) that would defeat the purpose of having a buffer state.
So NK is going to invest heavily in developing nuclear weapons or maybe work on getting a spy satellite in orbit? Maybe they could kidnap some Japanese nationals? Or, possibly to match Japan's belligerence, test out missiles and hold war games nearby to Japan.
They shoot missiles over Japan, Japan responds by amping military, NK complains about military buildup?
North Korea is the cause of Japan's military buildup. I hope it understands that. This year alone, the North test-fired 90+ missiles over East and West seas. On top of that, it fired so many artillery shells over the seas and demonstrated air-raid as well. How it can point fingers to others such as Japan and South Korea for military building ups?
At this point when I read a headline like this I see North Korea lifting Japan up and suplexing them into the ground. Although I know Japan would get up and North Korea would suffer a Stone Cold Stunner.
