Yep, I've also heard three different variations of who Jon Paul Mac Isaac contacted, upon discovering the "bad things on the laptop":
21. The blind MAGA supporter that found EvIdEnCe oF CrImEs later said that "there have been multiple attempts (after having taken possession of the laptop) to remotely insert questionable material onto the laptop, and passing off this misinformation or disinformation as originally coming from the laptop".
The very computer tech that 'discovered' the laptop, has lamented that other people have attempted multiple times to access the hard drive remotely, and add doctored information, with the goal to pass off as authentic and as having been on the laptop the whole time.
The same NYPost, that continues to falsely claim "The NY Times admitted the laptop is real", after the NY Times reported that certain emails on the laptop appeared to be legitimate, and not the laptop as a whole?
The lie was in claiming that, because the emails were genuine, that all of the contents on the laptop must also be genuine. Including the "salacious pictures package" that was added to the laptop remotely, while Rudy Giuliani possessed it.
The laptop was also accessed remotely, while in Rudy's possession, to add a "Salacious Pictures Package" folder with images.
It is also an incorrect assumption to assume all contents on the "hard drive" are genuine (as it has been confirmed that some files were added remotely, while the laptop was in Rudy's possession).
To be fair, “Computer Security Expert” Rudy probably calls USB thumb drives “hard drives” (Hey, you can’t bend them, they’re too hard!) so the terminology may be off….
