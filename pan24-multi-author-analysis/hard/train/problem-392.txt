If you read the whole report even with their made up methodology written by a guy with a degree politics not economics, Trump's entire deficit NOT offset by future earnings and savings was pandemic related.
Sorry I actually have a degree in Economics and do analysis for a living. Let's just focus on facts not opinions and not making arbitrary adjustments to how debt is calculated.
1) The MI analysis focuses on debt attributable to that President's policies. Obama isn't held responsible for debt that result from Bush's decisions; nor Trump for Obama's.
I also think Team Biden learned the lesson from 2009...in hindsight; Obama's Stimulus was too small and painfully high unemployment lingered for years (but inflation stayed low so....yay?). Biden's team probably felt the inflation risks were worth it to quickly get the economy churning again.
Then the inflation was already there when Biden got there. What are Republicans truly arguing here? It's okay when we do it, but Biden did it wrong because reasons?
