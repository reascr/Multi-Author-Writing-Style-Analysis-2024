Most of it is stuff that would have been decommissioned within the next decade or so anyway. A good bit is old soviet tech that Warsaw pact nations have wanted to swap out for the NATO standard equipment. It's provided a way for NATO to clean out its garage so it can make room for the new stuff. Now all these nations are able to backfill with shiny modern tech from the US, Europe and Korea.
A lot of the dollar numbers that get thrown around on the news are the cost to acquire the system new. In reality sometimes the real world cost to the nations supplying them is about whatever it costs to ship it. The US advances their weapons development so fast that even some of the more modern and effective systems they're sending aren't too far away from being retired from active service. Meanwhile they're providing outsized value by being used to defend Europe.
I mean, whose Germany defending Europe from except Russia? Money spent now is the same as money spent later, except right now German lives aren't spent as well.
There are only two conceivable wars that might break out, namely Greece/Turkey and another Balkan kerfuffle, and neither is of the same scale.
