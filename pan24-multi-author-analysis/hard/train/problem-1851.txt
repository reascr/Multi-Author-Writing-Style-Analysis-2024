Lol who cares? I grew up in the cold war and these headlines were pretty common, the same problem Russia and the rest of the nuclear powers had then still exists now, if a single one of those warheads is ever used in anger the offending country gets turned to glass.
Except that we have literal proof of this not being the case when it comes to nuclear weapons, in living memory, during the most brutal periods of the post ww2 soviet union, which was as close to a cult of personality as you could get.
you have to trust your enemy is that crazy. Odds are they're not. That's what the soviet missile commanders decided when they didn't hit the button when their EW satellites picked up a weird glint off the atmosphere and had a false positive massive nuclear first strike coming out of america.
We're really not, though. You would need every person in the launch chain to be suicidally crazy. It's not just like the president of the US or putin can just unilaterally declare they want to do a first strike, they'd have to get everyone in the chain to go along with that. Soviet missile base commanders have refused the order in the past on more than one occasion.
