They have social media and individuals have pages so idk how it’s truly changing smth. they removed&changed a lot of stuff cause westerners don’t comprehend that same symbols can have different meaning, Ukraine already had lists of banned symbols and they weren’t used anything illegal already. even the alt right guy who founded azov has his blog where he posts dead russians. (He left a fee years ago batalion to focus on politics without success).
Alt right founder who left the group has his blog on tg where he just post fk russians and long live ukraine. Pics from battlefield, dead russians pics .
How dedicated were they to fighting russians? Well when the nazis rolled into ukraine, they joined the SS. So they could kill russians mainly, but also, y'know, they did participate in some massacres of poles and jews, because :shurg_emoji:.
Acknowledging that Azov purpose is rotten and they are nazis and should fuck themselves does not qualify as russian propaganda, only as good sense. Fuck the entire Wagner Group, fuck the invasion, fuck Putin for enabling nazis and using this same nazism as an excuse for a genocide attempt and fuck the entire Azov Battalion. To hell with them.
