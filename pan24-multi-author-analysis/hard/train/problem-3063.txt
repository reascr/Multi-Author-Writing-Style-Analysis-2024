It does boggle the mind what kind of a ghoul you have to be to even think this would reflect badly on Biden.
If it seems more intense with Biden, it’s only because it’s a mirror of how badly they have to compensate for Trump.
Trying to drag Biden down to that level is the most logical thing possible for them to do. Horrifying, amoral, and disgusting - yes. A sham? Yes, that too.
yup. Focusing on Hunter Biden, or the emails, or Benghazi, isn't the point. The point is you're always investigating, because the Democrats are always corrupt, always doing something underhanded, and we're going to figure out what!
Bingo They have been having wet dreams about democratic scandals coming to light or a democratic president resigning in disgrace for a long time. They were so sure they finally had it with Clinton's blow job and they just completely lost if when it turned out that despite the prudery, no one outside of the most rabidly rightwing partisans gave a single fuck about it.
IMHO, that's what the GOP was most worried about with Obama. Clinton has been a fundraising and support powerhouse for democrats ever since he left office, and they saw Obama as Clinton 2.0. Because he was once again about as middle of the road democrat as you could get while also being extremely likeable. He also showed a lot of willingness to compromise on sane conservative ideas early on. They decided that their best bet to counter that was to get so far to the right of center that compromise would be impossible.
