Leopard tanks are proprietary tech that Germany owns the license to for exporting i.e buying and selling. When you buy them, part of the agreement of their use is that any sale of them must be approved by Germany so they don’t go to countries Germany doesn’t want them to go to, for obvious reasons.
If I was Poland, I wouldn’t give a damn about export agreements. If Ukraine falls, they’ve got Russians on their border. Plus there’s plenty of other countries in the world to buy MBTs off of if Germany refuses to sell them more Leopards in the future.
Why can't countries with Leopard tanks just go ahead and send them to Ukraine without German approval (with the exception of the Netherlands since they don't actually own their tanks).
Germany aren’t willing to send tanks to Ukraine unless the US does that does NOT mean they are intending to block re-exports from other countries as stated by the German Defense minister.
Keep in mind that Germany had to actually change its laws to support Ukraine as before the war started there were laws in the German constitution forbidding exporting weapons into active warzones.
That Germany isn’t taking the issue seriously for one, the other problem with your comment is that you do not differentiate between Germany exporting tanks to Ukraine and then issuing re-export licenses.
Because Germany stated from the beginning they would not set precedents but would happily match the guidelines set by the NATO coalition.
