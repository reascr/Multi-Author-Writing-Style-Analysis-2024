The Wagner Group has roughly 50,000 personnel currently stationed in Ukraine, including 40,000 convicts who have been recruited from Russian jails, according to the White House. Its fighters have recently been involved in heavy fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, and forced Ukrainian troops to retreat from the town of Soledar this week.
"As sanctions and export controls on Russia from our international coalition continue to bite, the Kremlin is desperately searching for arms and support — including through the brutal Wagner Group — to continue its unjust war against Ukraine," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. "Today's expanded sanctions on Wagner, as well as new sanctions on their associates and other companies enabling the Russian military complex, will further impede Putin's ability to arm and equip his war machine.".
Yyyyup. Wagner group is named after hitler's favorite composer. That's not a coincidence, that's actually why they're calling themselves wagner.
You can look up an old photo of a wagner top dog with swastika tattoos. Along with another photo of him standing next to putin at some formal event.
Wagner has all manner of weapons in their disposal short of nuclear - tanks, heavy armor, planes, artillery systems. They recruit from russian prisons above any law or authority. The only person in russia who can allow that is putin.
Simply put, Russia does not care. Any type of collateral damage to human lives or the country's reputation is worth it if they gain an inch. They are literal nazis and named after Hitler's favorite composer Richard Wagner. Putin does not care that he is fighting "nazis" with nazis.
