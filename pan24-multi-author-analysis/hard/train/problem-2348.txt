They phased out coal and nuclear in order to instead use natural gas. With the current war going on, they stopped buying Russian gas, but still have to get their energy from somewhere.
Gas has only become marginally more efficient, and the risk of getting cut off from Russia was never tackled. As it turns out, after 30 years of billions a year in subsidies, gas "just isn't there yet and it just doesn't work yet to supply the country the power it needs". Imagine what they could have done with fossil fuels if they've gotten that money in stead.
The tech is there and it was there 30 years ago, just less efficient. It's very sad that Germany is both a leader in renewables and not even at 50%.
Except that didn't happen. They didn't pay the higher cost for renewables, compromise after compromise, gas got expanded for so long it's now even too late for renewables.
Renewables won’t be enough for current demands for years to come (if ever at this consumption rate).
So maybe these people should stop using electricity, cars, and anything that uses coal, oil, or nuclear power to cut down on demand. Without the need for the coal, this wouldn’t happen. The clean electric isn’t quite there yet, not enough to power nations and industry. I can understand them wanting to protect the town from being destroyed though.
