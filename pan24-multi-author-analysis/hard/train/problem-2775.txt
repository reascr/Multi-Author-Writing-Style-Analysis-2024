The DOJ isn’t even including any documents that Trump willingly turned over in their investigation. So now Biden’s own DOJ is scrutinizing him more than Trump.
And iirc the special counsel for the Biden investigation was appointed by Trump, which in my mind gives Biden even more brownie points, he’s not even being investigated by his own guy.
Then I may have been misinformed, I’d been under the impression that the special council for Biden’s investigation was some sort of holdover from the previous administration.
So as not to appear weak, they try to normalize Trumps behavior by “finding” classified documents in Biden and Pence’s possession.
Trump was clearly intentionally taking papers on purpose, while Biden (or one of the varied people working with him across his eight years as VP, which is when these documents are from) misplaced papers incidentally.
Then Trump did anything and everything in his power to keep all the documents and even demand their return after they were seized, while Biden immediately had the people who found the misplaced papers get in contact with the appropriate authorities, cooperated fully, and began the immediate search for any further misplaced documents to ensure all were returned.
