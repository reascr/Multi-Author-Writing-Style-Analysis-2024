Does the Kremlin not understand that making threats is either going to hurt their credibility or it's going to have the opposite effect? They're basically arriving at the same levels of absurdity as North Korea, threatening to drop a nuke from one day to the next, as if they thought this was the only reason they haven't been invaded until now..
I 100% agree with this. I don't mean it should only be a threat, but I also don't mean to say Poland should just fully invade. Treat it like a negative peace. Act as if Russia might invade at any point, so you station troops at the border, you attack trade ships, you quadruple support for Ukraine.
I am on your side concerning the forcing Russia to take it back part, at least very clearly calling them out and demonstrating close Nato ties. But we really want to avoid to threaten with war or even declare it. If we make a threat, we have to act accordingly or our word will lose value, just like Putins did. Also a threat doesn’t justify a declaration of war (we try to uphold international law). Furthermore we would lead a war of aggression not Defense, which would really heighten the risk of nuclear escalation. But you are right, we can’t leave such threats unanswered.
You don't let a bully run around and threaten everyone because he might do something. You call his bluff. The world can not deal with any nuclear capable nation threatening its neighbors with impunity. He should be the one afraid.
