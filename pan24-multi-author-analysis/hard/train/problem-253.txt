Lol what??? More than half the countries in the world are democratic. Support for democracy worldwide is still very strong.

But that's besides the point. The topic at hand is an authoritarian regime manipulating the populace of other nations to erode support for their democracy, push policies that negatively impact the other nation (Brexit), and sow unrest and dissent.
It would be rightfully considered unacceptable if leavers lost and tried to undermine democracy by stating that, due to low turn out, the referendum does not actually represent the interests of the majority of British people and should be ignored.
I do question of the legitimacy the referendum and the previous governments who did not attain an actual directly supported positive 50+ % majority.
To question the legitimacy of the Brexit referendum is to deny the legitimacy of every single government the UK has ever had. If that's your position, then fair enough. If it is not, then your assertions are intellectually dishonest, and driven by nothing more than political emotions.
