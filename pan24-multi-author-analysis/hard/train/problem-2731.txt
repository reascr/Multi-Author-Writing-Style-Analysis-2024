I'm not an "EVERY HUMAN LIFE IS PRECIOUS" guy, but there just isn't an available procedure to ensure that every single execution is justified, and that means that we shouldn't be executing people.
It also assumes that everyone put to death is guilty, which is a biiiiiiig assumption given the statistics. 190 people on death row have been proven innocent since '73 (slightly under 1500 have been executed) and those are just the ones who've successfully navigated the incredibly difficult task of having their case reinvestigated and heard again.
There's no threshold that we can reasonably set that will exclude every person that shouldn't die. The threshold is already as stringent as it can be and we still kill innocent people, the mentally ill, etc.
The government is supposed to protect people and ave lives not end them, lethal force should only be used if there is no other way to reduce harm.
Executions do not work as a deterrent to crime, they cost us more than removing freedom for life through an institution, and they make us look like neanderthals.
