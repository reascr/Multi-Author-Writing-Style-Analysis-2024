Countries get to decide for themselves what does and does not constitute an act of war. Fact is, you target/kill the US President, you can expect heavy retaliation. In this hypothetical scenario, the most likely consequence would be the same that the US has threatened Russia with if they would use a tactical nuke in Ukraine: total annihilation of their forces in Ukraine and surrounding area's through a sustained air campaign. The US would not set boots on the ground, nor strike deep into Russia, but it would effectively remove their ability to wage war or attack Ukraine.
Fact is, the POTUS visiting Kyiv is a signal of American strenh and dominance. Russia bombarding Kyiv while he is there, is a challenge to that dominance. Therefore, a response to cement that dominance would be required on the part of the US. What the response would be, is hard to say. I'm sure the Biden administration would have gamed out those scenario's beforehand, and may have even informed Russia on the type of consequences they could expect through the deconfliction hotline when they informed Russia of Biden's visit.
So, I think there is almost no chance of Russia attacking Kyiv during Biden's visit, I don't think it would result in boots-on-the-ground war in Russia, but would force many fence-sitting countries to abandon support for Russia.
If Biden died as a result of Russian military actions, I have no doubt we'd see a similar reaction. Probably not as strong, and maybe not as global, but people would come together. Because at the end of the day, this is the United States. We are a big fucking deal globally, like it or not, and attacking us has consequences.
