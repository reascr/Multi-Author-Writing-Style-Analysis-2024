To the extent that the policies were "successful" in empowering the Libyans themselves, this is good. To the extent that it did not miraculously bring about some kind of Utopia perhaps not so good. Then again, expecting a 40 year autocratic regime that attacked their neighbors, sponsored terrorism and repressed their own people to transition non-violently is and was probably not going to happen. They are no longer under a country wide sanction by the US so that is the point - US foreign policy adjusts to the situation.
Cuban people starving is the result of Cuban domestic policy choices. Their government takes full credit when things go well and takes the blame when it doesn't. I get the sentiment that the US should "help" but I don't get the sentiment that it is primarily the US's obligation to do so. (not withstanding the fact that the US appears to be intent in providing humanitarian aid to Cuba after the recent hurricane AND has done so in the past).
Yeah, I find it hard to believe any HDI that comes from Cuba considering we Americans are only shown American propaganda against Cuba. Maybe if we actually allowed Cuba to participate in the world economy and have access to essential resources, we could determine with our OWN brains if Cuba is a failed system or not.
