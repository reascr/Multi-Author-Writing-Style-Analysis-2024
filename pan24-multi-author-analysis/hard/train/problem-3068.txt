Well, Republicans control education in Texas, so if there's a problem you know who to blame. In fact, Republicans have controlled Texas for about 30 years, so really ANY complaints people have about the state can be laid at Republican feet. That gerrymandering they did last redistricting and are wanting to do again? Gee I wonder why people are losing faith in democracy when we're watching it dissolve in front of us.
Go figure: democracy and public education aren't working in Texas, so of course people are losing faith in those things.
When government cannot meet the basic needs of its citizens, those citizens stop thinking that it's a good thing to have that government.
The state is gerrymandered to hell, so votes don't matter the way they should; the leaders cannot be held accountable for their crimes (See AG Paxton) or incredible failures (Abbot + winter = you're gonna have a bad time); I mean what is anyone expecting?
When the state continually elects and re-elects politicians whose party platform is to erode and dismantle the public institutions that provide services to better citizens, what the fuck did they think they were going to get?
I have family and friends in Texas and it's ridiculous how a state that's been completely gutted by GOP control over the past few decades has convinced the voters there that all their problems are because of powerless Democrats and California somehow. Even the left leaning people I know shrug off their state's rising prices, crumbling infrastructure, and general incompetency with 'It's because of all the Californians moving here...' as if CA had some natural disaster and is now completely empty. It's the failure of your own Republican government.
