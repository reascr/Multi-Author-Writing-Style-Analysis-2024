huh. Or when 241 US marines and 57 French special forces were blown up in their sleep by Iranian suicide bombers...
That's why there are a couple videos from drones coming out each day of drone bombs impacting objects. They use the over watch drone for targeting and guidance for the smaller "suicide" drones. Even the loitering munitions that have built in cameras for the operators, like the Switchblade and Lancet, use over watch drones with better visual equipment untill they're in the final descent to the target.
A volley of Shahed 136 is launched in a direction and an overhead drone with visuals on targets sends the final radio signal for the targeting.
A drone can maneuver easily on all directions, stay still, stop mid air, land and launch again, a missile can't do any of that.
The difference is that most drones drop or fire their munitions then depart. A suicide drone kamikazes and does not return.
A “suicide drone” is another name used to refer to loitering munitions. A cruise missile only has one mode of function. You designate a target and the missile flies directly there to impact it. A loitering munition, on the other hand, typically has two. They can be used just like a cruise missile like we see Russia using most of its Shaheds in Ukraine, where they fly from point A to point B to impact whatever target is given to them. However, they also have the ability to “loiter” in the air around a given area, waiting for their operator to designate a target for them to impact. They’re often more similar in appearance and function to drones than missiles, which is why the name “suicide drone” appears frequently in the media.
