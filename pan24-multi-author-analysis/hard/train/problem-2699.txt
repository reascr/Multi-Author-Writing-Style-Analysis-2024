Sorta what I thought. Its their job as reporters to bring to light what you did. In this case, donating to a political party that has sorta gone off the rails toward fascism. Donating to said party might imply that you enjoy the hateful chaos that this particular party brings to the table. That's why people freak out, not because of the media. Fuckin shithead.
This fucking bullshit. Bottom line the world was different in 2009 compared to 2011 and it has only gotten worse. It wasn’t about upholding shit from the 70s that was always there, it was about once again inventing a precedent, or excuse to create the unregulated and further corrupted result they and the federalist society desired since before citizen’s united even started.
How was this even remotely possible? Could it possibly have anything to do with Citizens United opening the door to foreign financial influence JUST LIKE EVERYONE BACK THEN SAID IT WOULD?
Edit: to add how disgusting it was to hear people back then (and apparently right fucking now) try to paint the Citizen’s United decision as anything but a green light for unencumbered financial influence over politics. Back then it was a “narrow decision concerning freedom of speech” and fast forward to now and the president can get laundered cash from Russia via the NRA while the same foreign power maligns the other candidate and Putin holds more sway over the executive branch than the US’ own intelligence agencies.
