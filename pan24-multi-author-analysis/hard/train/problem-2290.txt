republicans need to realize that the “ultra-rich” are the people in the top 0.01%. People with 5 million won’t even be noticeably impacted. it’s the people with 20+ million we’re talking about.
People with 5 million are mostly people that are about to retire. If they have a multi-million dollar a year salary then yeah, of course, but screwing over people with decades of savings isn’t right either.
Some, even ultra wealthy, are like “let’s do it Make me pay my fair share I’ll still have more money than anyone can spend in one lifetime.”.
Yeah but then we are talking like 401k millionaires, and most of those are not going to try and use it all at once to live like millionaires.
When I think "millionaire" it translates to someone who can spend large amounts of money without worry due to huge income sources. Not average guy who has been saving for 30+ years to ding into the 7 figure savings bracket.
Let's say, that as a household, you make $100k and are prolific savers. 20% is not outlandish for very aggressive savers. Saving that much, negatively impacts your lifestyle - those people are making a decision to give up today for tomorrow.
