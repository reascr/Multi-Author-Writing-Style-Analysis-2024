Even through his soft-ball questions and friendly edits, it was obvious that her staff is manipulating her like 'Weekend at Bernies'.
Shitty LA Times needs to look in the mirror at how they gave Feinstein a free pass. Their only interview with her this decade was unfreezing George Skelton to have him sit down with her and her staff (no pictures, no video).
Looking back its a good thing Kevin De Leon is such a horrible politician he couldn't even beat that zombie last election; now that the Times finally discovered that he and some of the Latinos controlling LA City Council are racist against black people.
Katie's my Rep now, and hopefully we can replace her with someone good. She'll be a great Senator, a Gen-X Elizabeth Warren who must have learned from .
She’d be amazing in the Senate, and smart of her to jump out early and get ahead of other potential candidates. Now we just have to hope Feinstein’s massive ego doesn’t cause her to mount an absurd reelection bid in ‘24.
Feinstein is 89, and don't members of the Senate whisper that cognitively she's in serious decline? I honestly don't get any senator that is so old they don't just retire and enjoy their remaining days on Earth relaxing.
