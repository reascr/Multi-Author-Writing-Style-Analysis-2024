Yeah but the democrats don't need to get those ones, they just need the infighting to continue long enough that 6 semi-reasonable Republicans are sick of it and then all the democrats + 6 Republicans vote for the more moderate Republican.
Not just that but all because a Democrat becomes a Speaker doesn’t change the fact Republicans won’t still have majorities on the committee level, any Republican who defects will easily lose all of their committee assignments.
Having a Democratic Speaker even though they’re in the minority makes House Republicans like extremely incompetent. As backwards as it sounds for the bulk of the Republican base It’s better to have continuous votes for speakership than let a Democrat become the Speaker.
No chance of 6 Rs backing a Dem speaker, or of any R accepting a position of Speaker that relied on Dem support to keep them in power. They'd 100% lose their next primary, the republican base won't stand for that sort of moderation.
I just hope all this bitter in-fighting will render the republican controlled house all but useless. Like, I'm hoping these debates stir up a lot of bad blood so they won't even be able to come up with a majority on most things.
