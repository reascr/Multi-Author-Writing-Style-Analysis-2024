Giving the name of the facility doesn't help anyone at all since I'm assuming she was one of several people giving out vaccines there. That means that almost all of those 8000 either remained unvaccinated unless they decided to go back just in case, and thousands more people had to question whether or not they actually got the vaccine the first time and many probably went back and got one too many doses. Also she most likely killed at least one of those 8000 people, probably more even outside that group since it says that it was mainly hospital staff that she was vaccinating which means the virus got to spread around more easily among the sick and elderly. Ridiculous that you can cause such a clusterfuck and face such little punishment. They should investigate every single person she "vaccinated" and charge her for every single covid death of any of them.
So, there is a good chance that some of these people died or suffered lonerm/permanent injury from covid infection due to not being vaccinated. This should be jail time.
