The pope at the time of WW2 sheltered literally thousands of Jews to protect them from the Holocaust, and he literally had contacts with the German resistance and was passing on that intelligence to the Allies, i think that would be considered "helpful".
"Pius’ supporters—many of whom have advocated for the pope’s canonization—point out that the Catholic Church saved thousands of Jews by hiding them in churches and monasteries across Italy, as well as in the Vatican itself. Though acolytes argue that Pius’ inaction and silence allowed these secret actions to continue, critics cite the treatment of Jews living in Rome during World War II. As NPR’s Sylvia Pogglioli points out, a plaque standing just 800 yards from St. Peter’s Square states, “On 16 October 1943 entire Jewish Roman families ripped from their homes by the Nazis were brought here and then deported to extermination camps. Of more than 1,000 persons, only 16 survived.”.
I don't like what's happening in Ukraine either. But to compare the invasion of Ukraine to the systemic murder of over 6 million Jews during the 2nd world war is basically Holocaust revisionism.
Yes that is true, but comparing it to WWII is better for the fact that more people are familiar with the situation involving the Nazis then they are with that of the Bosnia/Kosovo conflicts.
But if we were to compare it to Yugoslavia in the 90s (specifically Bosnia and Kosovo) that would be more apt, and is still very much enough to be angry about.
