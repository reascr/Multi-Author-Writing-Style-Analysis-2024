Yeah, it's the same in Oregon, but because I'm a contractor working for a company that doesn't have 10 employees in Oregon, they're not required to provide sick leave. And the changes that Oregon enacted won't change that.
Because there actually was such legislation already. It was a separate bill, but it passed the House. The Senate, not so much. I know he voted against that legislation because it didn't contain that. I'm not sure whether he proposed an amendment to add it, but if he did it failed.
So you think he should submit a standalone bill, that does the thing that just failed to pass? And just days before the congressional session ends? What is that supposed to accomplish?
His complaining was in part what got the Senate vote to happen in the first place, which is ultimately what you want him to do: get votes for policies he advocates.
Besides, we literally just voted on the exact thing he is quoted for suggesting in the article. It didnâ€™t get 60 votes to pass the Republican filibuster.
