I think they are referring to the family the US killed in a drone strike while targetting the person they said was behind the attack that killed US troops at the airport.
I don't think I can agree that ISIS are ever going to be justified in randomly killing people by blowing themselves up , even if those people are "foreign invaders".
When you start applying the term “terrorist” to people that are attacking legitimate military targets of a foreign invader…that’s where you lose me. Especially because we have killed a horrific amount of innocent civilians. If a country invaded America and accidentally blew up my wife and kids, I couldn’t give a fuck less if they didn’t mean to. I’d be on borrowed time, and taking as many of the invaders with me as possible. It wouldn’t matter if they were directly responsible for the death of my family, if they were a member of the military that did it…fuck em.
I was just pointing out that if someone is wearing a suicide vest and blows it up, they probably weren’t an innocent civilian.
This sounds more like a partially successful suicide bombing than a successful assasination, this guy can't have been that important if they had him in a suicide vest.
