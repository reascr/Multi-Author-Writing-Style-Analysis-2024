Plus there are around 5 countries at the tournament which have anti homosexuality laws. Waiting for people to protest against them. Especially if any of them turn into the plucky underdog team of the tournament story.
So if people want to protest about Qatar hosting, shouldn’t you also complain about the other teams and current Rights issue? Or just ignore otherwise well have less teams at the tournaments .
Except if every team did it then what do they do? They’d end up with no teams left. I mean I guess that gives Qatar a route to the final, which might be their ultimate goal now I think about it….
What a win for a world champion who wins the cup in Qatar. Big nations should simply play their own cup inofficially. Stream it for free and show what real football is. Not this FIFA shit show.
Didn't FIFA say Russia can't be part of the world cup? Isn't that political? Absolute double standards FIFA are a shambles someone needs to make a new non corrupt fifa and have away with them.
So does it say in the rule book how many seconds or minutes you have to remove it? If a player takes 2mins to remove it will they be sent off?
