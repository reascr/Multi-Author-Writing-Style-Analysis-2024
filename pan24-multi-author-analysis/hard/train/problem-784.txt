I get the feeling that this was one of the Russian soldiers recently mobilized with next to no training and crappy gear just looking for a way out. Any means to make contact with the Ukrainians without getting killed is an oppertunity.
This obviously isn’t the case, and as soon that man opened fire, Ukrainians had full authority to kill every single one of them. Prisoners can only be taken once the enemy decides to fully surrender.
There’s a bunch of the prisoners laying down on the ground surrendering, and then there’s another guy who CLEARLY lifts up his rifle and starts firing at the camera man, or someone near by.
The Russians can all wave the white flag, and have the drones inspect them close up to drop all their weapons. Then they can follow the drones for a proper “rendezvous” so to speak….
Soldiers cannot be lowering their weapons in the middle of the battle to “guess and choose” which enemy has surrendered and which ones are still fighting. If bullets are flying, it is still and combat zone. No POWS will be taken despite them trying to.
