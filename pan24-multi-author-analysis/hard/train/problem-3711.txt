If anyone is wondering it’s actually because the Israeli government prohibits Jews from traveling to Palestinian Territories unless they are there to steal land. Source: American that’s been to the West Bank.
Yeah the West Bank is much more reasonable. They do still execute gay people, but that’s more community-driven and extralegal. There are entire organizations devoted to assisting gay Palestinians in escaping the West Bank to Israel because they fear for their lives.
- Gaza, a state whose government explicitly calls for ethnic cleansing of their neighbor, murders gay people, and who regularly launches rockets at civilian targets;.
Gaza’s government explicitly calls for ethnic cleansing of Jews from the region, and they kill gay people. Shit’s wild with the double standards on Israel.
Criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism. But there's scarcely an anti-Semite around who won't pass it off as "Criticism of Israel", or "anti-Zionism".
Get out of here with your antisemitism bullshit the second someone says anything negative. You can’t make everything about that. Granted some things are, but the more you make everything about that, the more you’re creating the divide and just alienating people from being critical. Everyone is fair game to be critical off.
