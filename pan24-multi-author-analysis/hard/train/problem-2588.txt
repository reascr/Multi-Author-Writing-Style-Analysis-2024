"Norway will order 54 new German-made Leopard 2 tanks for its army from the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann Group, and will get an option to buy a further 18 tanks at a later time, the government said on Friday.
Europe’s armies are armed with Leopards, and Norway has decided to spend its money buying this tank because of European standardisation. How will you argue against what THEY JUST SAID?
Do you think they would be using the American built military infrastructure and training? Or start anew? Obviously they would be going with what they already have in place. The Iraq army is American armed and trained. That maintenance capability is a holdover due to supporting the large American presence. It’s not some home grown domestic capability.
""We ensure that we have the same tanks as our Nordic neighbours and many key NATO allies," Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference.
