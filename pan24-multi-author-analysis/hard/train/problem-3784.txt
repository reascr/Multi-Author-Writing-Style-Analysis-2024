It also annoys me that the media calls this shit "Right to Work". Can you imagine the conservative anger if the media called it "Union Stomping" or "Right to Poverty"?
You can disagree with your union and still be part of the union. I would say lots of people regularly don't agree with everything their union does, just like most people don't agree with everything their government does.
Or if you aren‚Äôt in agreement with the union you can still work. It affects me. Don‚Äôt agree with the choices. But I do me. If they desire more funding then they can listen to those of us that aren‚Äôt funding. Meet our requests and there ya go. A union within a union. Unionception.
We have a department of 10 that joining the union in our setting would not benefit. We were ‚Äúsold off‚Äù to be under another dept. said dept joined a union thus forcing our shop into it as well.
Um, no one is forced to join a union. There's plenty of jobs where union membership isn't required. Just get a job somewhere else. Isn't that the Republican philosophy? ü§î.
Wages in the states where these laws were passed decreased or remained flat in comparison to places that didn't have them.
