Were it not for the ever-more-viscous Gerrymanders in several states, including Wisconsin, Mississippi, and Texas, the Democrats would hold a 10-seat majority in the House next term. From memory:
- Democrats got a total congressional vote in the high 40% range in Florida, and won 6 out of 28 seats.
For example, suppose in Texas the GOP candidate gets 48% of the popular vote, the Dem gets 46%, and 3rd party candidates get the remaining 6%. The result is that the GOP candidate wins 100% of the Texas EC votes, the same as if the GOP candidate got 100% of the popular vote.
All but 2 states use a "winner take all" system for allocating their EC votes: Whichever candidate wins a plurality of the vote in the state gets ALL the EC votes for the state.
So the 52% who voted against the GOP candidate effectively wind up helping the GOP candidate win the presidency because Texas gets more EC votes thanks to the presence of non-GOP voters in the state. Democrats in Texas are effectively "captured" by the GOP plurality and forced to help the GOP.
