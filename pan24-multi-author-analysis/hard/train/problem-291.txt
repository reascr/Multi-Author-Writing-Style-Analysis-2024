Yawn. Homophobia is such a crazy thing even in a form like yours. Why should anyone care how a gay character is shown anymore then they care how straight character is shown? Answer: homophobia. Why do queer people have to be portrayed or put into a storyline under such scrutiny that no other group of characters have to?
Thing is, nobody talks about "heterosexuality" being shoved in our faces when there's a hetero/cis character doing hetero/cis things that don't advance the plot. It might be pointed out as extraneous but it's never labeled as some kind of agenda being forced upon the viewer the way it is with an LGBTQ character.
It seems like they're setting the new movie up for failure with like 0 advertising and it looking shit so that they can blame it on the gay person lmao.
The only thing i can think of is not saying that it WAS a political statement to leave gays and other races OUT of disney movies for decades. But they are making strides to right that and include everybody, just like real life.
Since I have a couple of little ones I know that they are not doing that, so that's why I made the statement that I did.
What do you mean "most of the time"? Almost every movie Disney has ever made has no gay characters at all.
I know that the right wing media machine throws it in our faces, but I'm not sure that disney is doing the same.
