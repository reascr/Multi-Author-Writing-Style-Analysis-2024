Etc. Etc. Etc. We can count on the Republicans doing everything in their power to outlaw abortion. What's surprising is the constant fucking incompetence, hubris, and unforced errors occuring over at team D.
And every Dem majority/supermajority in the past 50 years that failed to read Rehnquist's dissent much less pick up a pen to codify the decision into actual law because "it was decided case law / precedent".
We can argue about whether this is a court issue and run on it for the next two decades, but as someone who is pro-choice and wants results I really wish we'd gotten 15-25 week protections in while Dems had the majority. Ideally that would be the focus now instead of leaving women to suffer in red states.
Probably about the same. A lot of the midterms was republicans having really, really bad candidates. People were basically going "I don't like these guys, but these other guys are election deniers and f that." I'm thankful the public did, as the DMC played a very dangerous game of helping more extreme candidates (putting something like $50M+ towards it) they hoped would be easier to eat beat. It didn't go really bad this time, but I'd like to see that tactic go away.
Have you read her opinions? They're often very outcome-oriented rather than sound legal theory, and full of appeals to emotion. I can see this being an emotional outcome for her for a lot of reasons, but damn, Ginsburg warned Rowe wasnt the best legal footing and this could be heading our way whejit passed.
