The problem is that looking at that agreement through a Russian lens it is useless because Russia never intends to actually comply. If Russia says 'we won't attack' they are already planning to attack, so when someone tells Russian 'we won't attack' then Russia assumes they are lying and are going to attack.
Even so, a guarantee saying that Russia won't attack won't mean much unless a violation draws in multiple countries to defend against a Russian invasion. Better to simply assume that Russia will attack and spend 5-10 years rapidly building defenses like Finland.
Certainly, but that is not going to happen while Putin thinks he can come out ahead of where he was before the 2022 invasion and while Ukraine sees that they can liberate even regional capitals from Russian control. Since a compromise now that gives Russia "a win" will only ensure future turmoil and suffering, Ukraine needs to keep pushing until Russia is forced to come to the negotiating table.
Absolutely - that’s why I think that Ukraine HAS to join NATO - it’s their guarantee against further trouble from Russia.
Once that is all done then we can tell Russia again that they don't get a veto on who chooses to join NATO. And Ukraine is free to join if they choose to. Russia has proven exactly why they are not to be trusted.
