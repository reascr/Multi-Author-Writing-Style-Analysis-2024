The transcript opens with Carroll's testimony. Trump's testimony starts on page 15 of 48 (numbered page 125). A few examples:
Trump: Now, like everyone else, she gets paid by a radical, left-leaning publisher to say bad and untrue things.".
This is who he is. He's irreversibly broken, and deeply pathologically disturbed. It is horrifying that he ever got within a million miles of any elected office, never mind the fact he served in that office for a four agonizing years.
He lies uncontrollably. Many, many lawyers have tried to coach him on giving sworn testimony. There are plenty of ways to skate around the truth, to obfuscate it and work around perjury laws.
Also the lies have to be about a material issue for it to be perjury. So the babbling about Mueller and the election is irrelevant, Trump says that crap whenever he opens his mouth. The only potentially material lie was his claim that he never touched a woman without her consent. I bet there will be a parade of witnesses at trial to impeach this statement, which will be a circus. "The plaintiff calls Billy Bush to the stand.".
Good point. Let's not forget, the only reason he got within a million miles of the presidency was because the Republican party nominated and elected him to that position. The GOP insisted on it. It wasn't really his decision, he was only in it for the grift.
