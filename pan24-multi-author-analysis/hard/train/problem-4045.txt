Fox said things. It got sued by a private entity. The government is taking no action to limit said speech. First Amendment is inapposite.
Because that itself would be a violation of the First Amendment. It would give the government the ability to regulate what is "news".
If you are travelling with a gang of wrestlers who will respond to this by suplexing nearby people, then you could be prosecuted for incitement.
Dominion is seeking like 1.6 billion. They probably won't get that much, but it could be pretty significant. This isn't a fine, it is damages in a civil suit.
Even with these civil cases it has some bearing. You can't successfully sue just because a news org got something wrong. They have to know it is wrong info and damaging to you.
>But mistakes are one thing; knowingly telling lies is another. What Fox’s pious proclamation of press freedom misses is that lies of the sort the network appears to have told its viewers don’t enjoy or deserve constitutional protection.
I’d also like a carve-out somewhere in this case to discuss whether FOX News can rightfully enjoy the "press" part in the 1A freedom of the press privileges.
