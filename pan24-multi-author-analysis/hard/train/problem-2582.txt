You think that’s why he is simping for Putin and xi? The status quo would be not invading Ukraine or Taiwan. Some really rich people make more money in times of chaos than status quo.
Most exceedingly wealthy people are generally upset by anything that might upset the status quo. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud are both still operating in Russia.
Short answer is no, his Twitter statements have cost him severely alienating his Tesla customer base and damaging Twitters advertising revanue. Starlink as a global communication service needs to step on as few toes as possible in order to have any chance to be allowed to operate pretty much anywhere.
I really hope the US GOVT or another entity will provide ukraine with the capabilities that starlink currently does, as I hope they continue to use Starlink.
But he tries to use the dependency Ukraine now has for Starlink as leverage. Thats simply a shitty move i light of them defending their homes.
Unfortunatly it seems that way. Otherwise they would have said something before... Videos of drones dropping bombs on Russian soldiers are all over the place für quite some time.
While drones are used to drop grenades they are also one of the mayor ways to detect and defend again at Russian attacks. Why the hell should they.
