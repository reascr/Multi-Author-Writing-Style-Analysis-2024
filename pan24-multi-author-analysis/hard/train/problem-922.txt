They can't fire you. Big whoop. They also don't have to give you your position back. Just a "comparable" position with your regular pay.
Other 1st world countries (AND DEVELOPING NATIONS) give women a portion of, if not all of their salary to stay home with their child. No questions asked. A lot of them are for a lot longer than 12 weeks. And your job is still protected.
Yea, your company might give you something. When I had my daughter, I had to use the short term disability benefits. They paid 60% of my salary for 6 weeks. I had to use PTO or sick time to make up for the rest of my paycheck. Then, for the next 6 weeks, I had to use just pto/vacation. I'm extremely lucky that there were a ton of PTO changes going on at my company and I barely had enough to cover that time (I had like 6 hours left when I went back. Had to hope my kid wouldn't get sick while in daycare for a bit because I had no PTO.).
Omg. Thats insane. Here in Slovakia you get 34 weeks and 75% salary coverage (up to around 1700€ I think), after you can take also parental leave till the kid is 3 years old, sadly with smaller fixed sum, around 500€. But its managable, if your partner works. Fingers crossed for better coverage in US.
