Exactly, idk how we're going to get the systemic changes we need to see now done with such gerrymandered voting and paying off our congressional leaders/insider trading.
Except that the "let's end moneyed politics" party has more or less the same list of donors, and makes sure to introduce it as a constitutional amendment which has a ridiculously high bar to pass so they can make absolutely sure their proposal won't actually pass.
republicans could decide they don't support buying politicians any time they want, it's not like they're legally obligated to support corruption or anything. they're choosing to be corrupt and they could choose not to be if they felt like it.
maybe instead of shitting on dems for not being completely perfect, you should find some way to convince republicans to stop being totally corrupt?
would it help if I told you we also did it before we lost the house, and removing the filibuster wouldn't have helped since a supermajority is required anyway?
Not only that, it requires a Constitutional amendment, which requires a 2/3rds majority in the House and in the Senate. It's more likely you see Kevin McCarthy and Eric Swalwell holding hands in public than this passing.
