Face it, with Sam Brinton people high up in the Biden administration allowed a major failure of oversight to someone privy to National Security information. Trying to excuse that is pathetic. Suggesting that the administration is now displaying some sort of nuanced accountability (in the face of a blatant and obvious failure of exactly that accountability in the initial hiring of this individual) is unforgivably stupid.
Man that is some next level spin. BTW MSN seems to disagree. As the position is a role in Civil Service it was hired rather than appointed, regardless this person was undeniably elevated into their position in the DOE under direction of the Biden Administration that is not debatable.
Donald Trump was a bad person; a pathological liar, fraud, and ultimately a possible criminal. I’m glad that you agree the current administration is just like the previous administration. That’s the extremely obtuse and reductive point you were trying to make correct?
Also what are you implying? Like what’s your point? What pass did this person get? And for what reason? You complain that this reason is not being named but you don’t name it.
