Atheism being immoral is a claim unsubstantiated by religious people since the invention of religion, which is often used to discriminate against atheists for no actual good reason.
Except nothing about atheism claims sexual orientation is morally wrong for no reason, which Abrahamic religious people do.
Plenty of atheists being homophobic following their own delusions, plenty of religious people being okay with it, including my own late mother and most of the guys I had fun with. Hell, if they weren't muslim it was difficult not to crack a joke about taking off cross necklace before sex so that Jesus won't punish them.
Again, Islam, just like any religion, has some pretty unsavoury passages, and the way of life it teaches is obviously incompatible with modern world.
Not to insult you, but your radical outlook mirrors the worst implementations of religion, a blind conviction and hate.
Religion sucks because it is always being hijacked by assholes and is difficult to fight against, but it doesn't turn people into monsters on it's own.
Also religion doesn't stop <insert Abrahamian religious group of people here> from conducting murders or killings.
At the point they do kill her theyâ€™re also murdering an innocent child and last time I checked murder is wrong in Islam as it is in literally every other religion.
