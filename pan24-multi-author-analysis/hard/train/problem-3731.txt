I’m not saying it’s not flawed but it’s better than another war. It is would be a huge geopolitical win if the current regime was replaced by a pro western government. However we gotta have some sort of plausible deniability in this sort of matter and the best option seems to be providing weapons to groups that are pro west.
The difference between what I suggested might happen and that, is we would never have boots on the ground in the scenario with providing weapons to Iran. We would just providing them with the means to oust their current government.
I’m sure a bunch of western intelligence agencies are foaming at the mouth to give these protesters weapons, just as soon as there is a semblance of an organized militia. But I’d say there won’t be any major invasions of the Middle East for at least another decade or so.
Cause the last time few times the west's has gotten involved in revolutions in the Middle East it hasn't blown up in our faces at all.
Getting rid of dictatorships isn’t easy but the west simply cannot be the cause of more instability in the middle east than it already have been.
