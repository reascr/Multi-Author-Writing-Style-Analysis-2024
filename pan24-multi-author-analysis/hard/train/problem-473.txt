That's huge, the UK just announced hundreds including bulldogs, with the potential for strikers from the US maybe to be announced. People are fixated on the tanks but other armoured deliveries seem to be ramping up a lot as well.
- Why the latest supplies of western Infantry Fighting Vehicles and tanks may not help as much as many think.
Tanks are normally not used in defense. They're part of a mechanized offensive force (just like IFVs and APCs more or less). This is the new step we're currently seeing.
There's probably not the 'one big reason' people are looking for. But I guess one major part of the internal discussions is the supply of clearly offensive weapons, which would match the russian escalation of the war. There are probably a whole lot of nation leaders who don't want to find themselves in a spiralling escalation.
Now with the rumoured new mobilization wave, possible arms supplies from Iran, ongoing radicalization of russian population, dramatic situations like the Dnipro apartment bombing there is a western will to match the escalation.
Notice how they didn't supply properly armed IFVs beforehand? Just M113 with a machine gun on top, maybe some old BMPs. Only (stationary) artillery, which enables Ukraine to hold their defensive line.
