Don’t get your hopes up, if anything if this happens enough detractors will support McCarthy just to avoid split committees. Keeping their committee powers is far more important. They can always just oust him at a later time.
Outside of that I also listed how both parties have a set of rules on how to oust a Speaker. Ousting a Speaker doesn’t have set rules by the House so it’s established in the party rules that’s based at the beginning of each congressional session.
The Speaker can block a general motion to vacate but they cannot block a party-led motion to vacate since they can’t unilaterally change the rules. Like I said, for Republicans the current threshold to initiate a motion to vacate is 5 members, once that threshold a reached it goes to a vote, the Speaker can’t block it.
Not entirely true, you can bypass the speaker and bring a bill to a full house vote by discharge petition, 218 votes is needed and Republicans will be able to get some bills passed. Anything too extreme will be shot down which is why they’ll never vote for a Democratic speaker.
If I was a centrist republican, I'd try to get nine other republicans to vote present. It would make Jeffries win the speaker, and it would show the freedom caucus that they can't rule over the rest of the party. Then just let the freedom caucus realize that they overplayed their hand. Once they do, you can call a motion to vacate and put McCarthy in the speaker position.
If McCarthy/whoever agrees to any of those they will lose too many gop votes for speaker, I would think. And we can't trust a gop speaker to follow promises any way.
