I'm certainly not blaming democrats more than republicans, but they 100% sided with capital against the workers when they decided to split the bill. It's the same thing they did with BBB. You can say half a win is better than no win, but fuck eventually these half losses are going to be insurmountable. And it puts into sharp focus that the Dems aren't exactly "good guys", they're just better than the alternative.
If they had left the bill as one, then there would be immediate and tangible repercussions for Republican fuckery. They could actually point to the railroad strike and say "See? This is what happens when Republicans get their way" and the public would be more incentivized to put pressure on Republicans because they are being affected. I am blaming Democrats for a very obvious tactical error, and for claiming to be working in the interest of the workers when they clearly are not.
What would have happened if democrats had decided to take the side of the workers? Knowing that they couldn't rely on the government to break the strike for them, the railway companies would've acquiesced to the union's demands.
Then it wouldn't have passed either but workers wouldn't be forced to accept a new agreement they already voted down. Seems like a fine alternative if you're actually supporting the workers.
