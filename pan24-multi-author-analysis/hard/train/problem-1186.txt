That's because you have no Republicans who lost what they call a "culture War" and the rest of the World calls progress. Having lost this War they invented, their only hope is to weaponize the Judiciary to undo laws they cannot defeat in the legislature and create laws they cannot pass in the legislature.
We need more Dems elected so we can begin to get rid of tRump judges - not all he appointed, just all who support him and his politics, 3 of whom are on SCOTUS as we speak.
Or, and hear me out here, "keep tradition" and just nominate hyperliberal judges from the 21 states where there's two democratic senators.
But how do you fix a system with a 100 Republican judges and 20 liberal judges because they packed it last term? You can't take the high road, say "this is wrong, we can't also do this" and simply expect the goodwill of the universe to make any meaningful change with only 20 judges in a 120 judge system (hypothetical numbers). You'll never get those other 100 judges to sign off on neutering the group that put them into place.
Edit: SCOTUS Barrett is a great example. Republicans spent 4 years talking about how they can't fill a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year because the American people deserve a vote in the coming term, then when it happens to them the next cycle, they jam in an unqualified extremist known for her anti abortion stance, almost no court experience and less than 5% of the typical document and case submissions. They pushed her through in what, 30 days or something stupid, world record just in time for the roe v wade ruling. You can't simply take the high road and accept that, and think that you're going to get anything done weigh the 6-3.
