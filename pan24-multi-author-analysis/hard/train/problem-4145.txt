Thankfully nukes are made so they need a very specific action to go off, which is why there haven't been any accidental nuclear explosions despite some pretty big accidents happening.
Nukes certainly prevented a war between Russia and other major players with nukes, which would've been more deadly.
If they didn't have Nukes then all of the countries supplying Ukraine with weapons to defend itself probably wouldn't have to add the stipulation of not attacking Russia back with said weapons.
Based on the Ukraine war rhethoric, if I was South Korea, I would base my deterrence calculus not on, "will China nuke us if we violate their no-first-use policy?", but instead, on "will China nuke us if have the option of nuking them right back?".
Right. And this is what happens when one side has its own nukes, and the other side relies on a nuclear umbrella from an ally, because that ally might not be willing to risk their own nuclear destruction.
And let every sovereign state, big or small, take care of their own defense and deterrence using nukes as a last resort, rather than dragging in overseas allies using the "we don't have nukes but they do" argument. There is a valid reason to complain about the US overreaching in either European or Pacific affairs, but giving each regional power the ability to defend its sovereignty with overwhelming force would do much to remove the reason the US uses to keep getting involved everywhere.
