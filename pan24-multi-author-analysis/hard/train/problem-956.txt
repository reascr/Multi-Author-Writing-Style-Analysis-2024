Skepticism is understandable. But Mueller ultimately reported to Trump and Senate Republicans ignored the evidence in covering for Trump during the impeachments. The fix was in for all of those previous attempts to hold him accountable.
The fix was in on all those previous attempts, but that wasn't 100% clear at the outset. In hindsight it was clear, but people legit believed Mueller was going to absolutely nail him to a wall. The fix could be in here also we just don't see it in the moment.
You put a period in Barr's quote that doesn't exist, missing important context: "the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department's principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of-justice offense.".
Ironic, yes. Surprising, no. Narcissists do not think the rules apply to them - just everyone else.
The classified documents give me hope. Trump's other crimes were financial, which our government typically just wants a cut of, and hard to prove things like J6 where he can pretend he didn't mean for anyone to go invade the capital. But with the classified documents he blatantly violated the law in the most serious way then lied several times about giving all the stuff back when he hadn't. I'm 99.9% sure there are even more stolen documents out there.
