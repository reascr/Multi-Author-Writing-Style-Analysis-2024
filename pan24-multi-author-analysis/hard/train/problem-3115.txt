I live in an expensive area and it's over $4,000 a month for my two kids. We make a lot of money but still can't buy a house here and childcare is a huge part of that.
We don't need infinite grow, we need replacement grow, and more and more young people are already choosing to have less kids, because it cost too much.
So your conresswoman for trying to pass a bill that would help families who have kids of toddler age who need day.
Maybe voters should force their representatives to pass the bill, otherwise tell them they will not vote for them.
politicians vote on bills based on what their voters want, generally speaking. this doesn’t do anything to move the needle in the direction of quality government run daycare.
Sherrill is my congresswoman and so I guess this is another one of her “at least I tried” attempts. Bills that have no chance of becoming laws aren’t an effective way to promote an idea. And in here in her district we have free day care starting at age 3 or 4 but the facilities are awful compared to private daycares. So more of that? no thanks.
Thanks for your kindness. I see it as different problems in different places my niece is in Vancouver bc and she had issues finding a primary care provider.
