Eh as a pro-Biden/anti-trump guy, exchanging a basketball player who was stupid enough to bring weed to Russia on a plane for a war criminal and prolific arms dealer is a bad fuckin trade.
The person being traded for Brittney is a high profile arms dealer and smuggler which seems to be a very lopsided trade in favor of Russia.
Because he's someone who used his connections in Russia and his airline to smuggle arms from Russia to Africa. He is basically one of the main reasons for why Russia doesn't have stuff in storage. His connections will have moved onto new things and again, he brought weapons out of Russia, not into the country.
'A lot of people seemed to think he was some sort of Gun wizard and was going to conjure weapons for Russia.'.
Yup. Bout never said he would serve on the front lines. He "If I could, I would share the skills I have and I would readily volunteer". His value comes from his contacts and understanding of international smuggling and trade. He absolutely can volunteer to aid Russia on that front. He was only arrested in 2008 and many of his contacts are still around and in positions of power. Plus Russia is heavily sanctioned so people with that skill set are useful.
