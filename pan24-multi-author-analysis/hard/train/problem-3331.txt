putin is too easy to put the blame on, but the reality is much more harsh. It's not putin who gives and executes the exact orders, it's not putin who is cheering up on the news of the dead ukrainian children in the comments, it's not putin who says nothing about this war, or even in some verbal or text form condemns it - but still fucking keeps funding it and support russian war machine with their actions.
Every. Fucking. Russian. Who does nothing to actually stop the war, overthrow totalitarian government, fight even for THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
But that's not for us to worry about. Our work is simple, see russian occupant - shoot this fuck on sight. Rince and repeat, until the last one of these raping, looting, torturing sons of bitches are removes from our land.
They’re raping babies and destroy families. Robbing them of everything they have and making sure that the Ukrainian people will never find the same happiness ever again. And then, if you dare to speak out against these soldiers, you’ll get banned for promoting violence… against violent people.
