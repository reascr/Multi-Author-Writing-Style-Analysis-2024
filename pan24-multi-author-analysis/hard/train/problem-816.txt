I mean the follow up to Hogan was Cox who was bananas. Maryland doesn't have the stomach for anything but a centrist governor. Hogan didn't even endorse Cox (not that he endorsed the democratic candidate).
I don't think I could vote for Hogan, not because he's not a competent executive but because I think Democrats have a better platform. At the very least Hogan is not ass over tea kettle insane.
Your entire comment is wrong. I'm not trying to be an ass, but no, Hogan did not toe the Republican party line, and no, Hogan didn't roll over for everything our general assembly passed.
When Maryland Republicans nominated an election denier to take Hogan's place Hogan was very quick to come out and decry him as a nut job.
Hogan will be the John Kasich of the next GOP primary, one of the few people on the stage not a raging piece of shit and therefore entirely ignored by Republican voters.
Shoot...I even forgot about John Kasich and he was my pick in the Republican primaries before I left the Republican party due to the emergence of Trumpism. It has been a long couple of years.
