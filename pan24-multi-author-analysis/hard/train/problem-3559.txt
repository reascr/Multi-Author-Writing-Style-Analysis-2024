OP is confused. Alcohol was supposed to be permitted on stadium grounds, just not within the stadium itself. You still needed a ticket to access these areas. Budweiser set up their alcohol tents there. Inside the stadium, just Bud Zero at the concessions.
And now Qatar reneged in the arrangement and alcohol isn't allowed on stadium grounds at all. That's the part that has people pissed. To pull this stunt just days before kickoff - and FIFA be fine with it.
It’s preposterous that FIFA would cowtow to this. If Qatar didn’t want beer, or women, or gay people in their football stadiums they shouldn’t have killed all those slaves to build them. Host your own medieval sporting event if you want to be barbaric thugs. How about a good public execution?
EDIT: alrite guys stop messaging me. As you can see a lot of other people have clarified what I meant about buying alcohol in UK football stadiums. You don’t need to add the same comment to the pile.
Same with the UK when we recently were part of the UEFA Euros Pan-European hosting. You can’t buy beer in British stadiums (because of our history) but we had to change that rule when we hosted matches during that tournament.
With the new tournament sizes after this I don’t think anything but stable multi country hosts will be allowed to host. I can’t really see the Middle East putting together a stable coalition of 3+ close countries to make it happen.
