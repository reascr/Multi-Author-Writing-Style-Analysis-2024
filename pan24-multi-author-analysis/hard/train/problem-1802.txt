I want an unbiased article that actually gives me factual information. I'm not asking them to insult their views. But they should present the opposite viewpoint coming from scientific understanding of bee behaviour for example. They should provide counterpoints both ways and talk about these being traditional views that run counter to expert advise but also that these views have long standing tradition so it's understandable that they ignore advice. And they should go into more detail of how they are usually handled and why it went wrong this time (if this is unusual). It's important to highlight these details. The article is essentially a presentation of quotes and beliefs with no actual substance. It's lazy and poor writing.
What an awful article. It frames it as if the family's understanding of superstitions around bees is normal and correct. What the hell are they saying? The bees killed him because he angered his ancestors? And it doesn't go into the truth of the situation at all. What did he really do to anger them? Maybe give more detail about bee behaviour and similar situations.
> However, while he was busy telling the bees he would address all outstanding rituals in due time, he came under attack.
Iâ€™d be interested to know what the exact circumstances of the ritual were, as bees are generally less aggressive when swarming unless the queen is under direct threat.
