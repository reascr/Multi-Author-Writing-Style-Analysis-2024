The sad part… the book probably is equally popular among Putin supporters and opponents… Opponents read it and think - this is exactly what Russia become (the saddest part is opponents thinking that Russia “become” 1984… when in fact it always was)… and supporters read it and been told - this is what “west” is.
while people in west should \also\ use the book to critically evaluate their own governments (the second gulf war was unnecessary... and the first gulf war and Afghan war... there \probably\ were diplomatic avenues that could have obviated the need for force... )... its not surprising that Russians could read 1984 and somehow see it as only applying to countries other than their own.
and i wasn't implying that people in the west don't do this... i felt while reading the book (both times) that it probably was meant as a critique of what any government could fall into, and that the warnings were universal. i've lived in different countries and its interesting how some of the groupthink can vary from place to place... conventional wisdom is... more local than universal.
(it goes without saying that Bush Sr. was playing world chess in terms of many of his actions... reformulating the middle east was part of his grand strategy... he just failed to see what one domino would do to the next very well.).
2. The second hypothesis says that this word is relatively new and it's formed from "врѣти" ("to boil").
