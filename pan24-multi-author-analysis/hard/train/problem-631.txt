The defense of Bakhmut has strategic significance. While it was soon to be deserted the ratio for casualties is so "good" that it is tempting to hold more than needed. It even went better than expected. Plus, the ukrainian spring offensive hasn't started yet so keeping the russian army focused on that front makes sens as well.
It also had more strategic value in the summer because the Ukrainian's didn't have fallback position's. If the russians broke through the Ukranians would have been in trouble.They've now built up defensive lines should Bakhmut fall for that value is gone.
Abandoning Bakhamut would not stop that depletion, this is logic akin to if Ukraine was not fighting battles the soldiers would not be dying.
Yes, but they would be depleting it anyway, as Russia seems to be insistent to force attacks even if they won't work.
We don't know what is the ratio of cost of holding it. There might be no strategic value in it, but if enemy is expanding much more than you, then you hold it until ratio becomes worse.
Yes that is my point, if Bakhamut is properly fortified and basically with almost no civilians left, it might be perfect place to hold instead somewhere else.
