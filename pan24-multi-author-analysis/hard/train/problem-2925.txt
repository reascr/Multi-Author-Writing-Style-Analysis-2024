Most ppl will get way more radiation from an airplane flight than swimming on that coastline. Radiation scares are often paid for by oil and gas companies because it's a direct threat to their industry.
It's the oil companies pushing the nukes, they know they are boondoggles that will take forever to build, in the meantime we keep burning oil. Russia is a prime example, they want you to buy their uranium, waste money on nuclear power and keep being reliant on them for both.
The oil and gas lobby are now fully behind nuclear as it will take decades to kickstart the industry after Fukushima with everyone realising what a liability the nuke industry had become. Money that could go to renewables is being spent on nuclear projects that wont be producing electricity for a decade or so. Small reactors, the hope of the nuke brigade will soon be seen as the folly that it is, reactors were made big to use economy of scale, small reactors will cost just as much to run as big reactors if not more.
Basically they can't afford to do the cleanup, up to US$660 billion is the latest estimate and they have blown past all the previous estimates so I expect it to reach a trillion. They can't keep up with the storage so time to dump it adding to the leakage that goes directly into the ocean from the groundwater seepage that has been occurring for years.
