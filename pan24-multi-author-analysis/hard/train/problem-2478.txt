True I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work but I would assume if you're already prescribed them you wouldn't need the visit for a refill. At least that makes sense to me.
Makes sense to me. Although I would think under certain conditions first time prescriptions can be done safely over telehealth.
Basic allergy meds are over the counter. Thousands of common and safe drugs are available over the counter. The oddball drugs and less safe ones should require a prescription and visit with a medical professional. In some cases telehealth might be proficient.
I guess the benefit of telehealth is that you can use them too? I’ve heard that Ritalin has a generic version for example. Elvanse/Vyvanse is more expensive and less stimulating, so maybe it’s not as popular yet.
The thing with ADHD is that if you’re able to “behave” as a child and avoid underperforming at school, people will assume you’re fine.
Nope, got it from a licensed specialist psychiatrist with 12 years experience with child and adult ADHD. I’m also not in the US and there’s not even remotely as big a profit motive to push diagnostics on people here.
