Man, I’m glad you’re ok. That kinda of laughter can lead to hilarity laughter which can be deadly. Be careful out there. The known pedophile Matt Gaetz has a chance to get busted this year and the sex offender Donald J Trump’s company is about to be sentenced. So there is more to come for sure.
I do. Not in my house, in my car, or around anyone not smoking, though. I mean, I have the right to smoke, and everyone else has the right to not breath my nasty smoke.
what about the stuff and 2nd hand smoke. what if staff is pregnant wont they be forcing the baby to also smoke.
what if the congress office next to you does not smoke. how do you keep the smoke in offices of people who smoke...
Ain't no good reason that the third spaces should have to be smoking ones. House cafe outside the usual cafeteria, bar, hell, freakin' parkour/jungle gym for all I care. Tobacco normalizing is so . . . dumb.
Pretty sure this is due to the perception that the smoking areas were one of the few areas that brought staff/aides for different politicos into regular proximity without 'business', and lots of old timers and younger staff seem to think that this is where actual non-partisan/humanizing contact and some deals were hashed out, more than the 'screw you, Pelosi, undoing all of your ideas and making libs mad' angle, though the latter, sadly, can't be discounted.
