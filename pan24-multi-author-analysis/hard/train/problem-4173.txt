Biden having 12-15 documents without intent while addressing the issue directly with the DoJ - versus - Trump taking 350 very high security docs on the way out. Refusing to return them and then lying to the DoJ about having more.
Yes but since Biden didn't take them with intent on the way out and commit other crimes then we can say that we must give Trump additional felony points.
O dang never mind the Vice President team or Biden did take just a few documents and maybe some more but sorry we will never lie again and be transparent.
Which fact doesn't in itself ensure all documents were properly returned, or that Biden is responsible for them not being returned. Maybe he failed to get things done, maybe staff or contractors under his direction failed to get things done, or maybe government employees failed to get things done. We don't have enough information to even know who was responsible for ensuring these documents were returned. Presumably the investigation will clarify such matters.
