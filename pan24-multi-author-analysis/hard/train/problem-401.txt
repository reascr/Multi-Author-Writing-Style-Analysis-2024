Hmmmm... Unlikely. We do t have many, they are mostly in the Baltic nations backfilling for Soviet tanks already forwarded to Ukraine. And they don't use NATO standard ammo or barrels.
They will certainly be able to operate closer to Ukraine's air defence without detection, and relay data back to other aircraft, but they can't get as close as F-22/35 etc.
Ukraine has apparently been able to protect the air force they currently have so far, so I don't think that's a big issue.
But that still gives them a much larger window to operate safely, and with AESA radar lob long range AA missiles at Ukrainian jets.
Secure air bases are a much bigger deal for F16s than Ukraine's current fighters. The latter were made to take off an land from roads and small airfields in the event that NATO attacks rendered Soviet airbases unusable. And that is how Ukraine was able to keep their jets in the fight, at least in the early days of the war.
Issue with anything flying above 50ft in Ukraine is that SAMs are too good. Patriots aren't going to protect F-16s from enemy SAMs.
