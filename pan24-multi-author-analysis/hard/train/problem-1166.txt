The Jan 6th prisoners aren’t talking because they’re in isolation. Reps have talked about it on the House floor numerous times. Look it up.
When PayPal and Youtube shut down accounts they kept the money in those accounts. You can look that up.
Look around, it’s happening here. We have people who have been held in prison since January 6th without being charged with a crime or allowed legal counsel. We’ve also had people locked out and funds taken from their accounts because they questioned the vaccines or elections. Russia doesn’t have a Constitution or a Bill of Rights like the US, and yet the government here treats some of its citizens like second class citizens.
For some reason this article doesn’t mention that this new law only applies to those who acquired russian citizenship, not to those who got it from birth. This is against the russian constitution which putin has never read anyway, but it will only affect a few people here and there with two or more citizenships who oppose putin from abroad. It’s definitely not gonna make people stateless, let alone save anyone from being drafted.
