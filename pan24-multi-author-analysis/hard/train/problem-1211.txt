Gregory VIII abdicated in 1415 because of political pressure during the "Western Schism" out of a desire to (re)unify the church.
Gregory VI resigned in 1046 at the Council of Sutri under allegations of "simony", aka accusations that he effectively purchased the papacy by bribing Benedict IX to resign. By most accounts, he seemed to freely admit to doing so, but argued that it still didn't constitute simony. That went over approximately as well as proposing that drag queen story hour becomes part of Sunday School, so he ended up resigning.
Sylvester III (1 month as pontiff, 1045), John XVIII (5ish years as pontiff, 1009), and then possibly-but-probably-not Liberius (365-366) and Marcellinus (304) are other candidates.
Depending on who's timeline you wanna follow, some combination of John XIX, Sylvester III and Clement II can all be considered predecessors to him.
Wasnâ€™t Sylvester III essentially a replacement for Benedict IX, and then Benny just swooped back in and took back the papacy? That whole story is wild. On par with the Borgias, if you ask me.
