Dude he allowed and protected Hindus who committed mass murder of Muslims and routinely sends his supporters to assault his political opponents.
When you vote for a Hindu terror org which is responsible for the rapes, murders of 1000s and destroyed lives of 100s of 1000s, you are a Hindu militant nationalist.
and if i vote for the other party i’m an anti-Sikh militant because they’re responsible for mass rampages that killed Sikhs. i’ll be stuck being an angry little turd on reddit like you.
india’s making good economic progress right now, especially given the circumstances. but if the fabric of society comes apart from hate mongering, all is lost. or if modi passes away, his party is rudderless and we are equally screwed. i always say that the biggest threat to democracy is the lack of a viable opposition. sad to say that the US also faces such a moment, as do many democracies.
If only a competent politician could rise and gain popularity. I blame the lack of options in India’s democracy squarely in the decision of the main (and once dominant) opposition party’s insistence that only someone from the Gandhi family can be their choice of PM. People are sick and tired of the nepotism and would rather have Modi than throw the dice with another Gandhi. The congress party only reversed this decision in recent months, and even then chose a completely unlikable party hack as their lead candidate — more likely to reward his loyalty than with any intention of winning an election. It’s a sad state of affairs.
Very sad. India may hold the geopolitical key to stability in the region - by virtue of rapid modernisation of its economy and industry. If China has a near-peer neighbour it might think twice before expanding with impunity across everyone’s borders.
Some progress is always better than no progress - but when your neighbours ie China are progressing at a lightning pace? Well you either match that speed of progression or get left behind….
