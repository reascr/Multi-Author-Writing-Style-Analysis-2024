What are you talking about? I didn't express any opinion about anything being right or wrong, Hamas said that they did it because of the conditions, go argue with them if it's justified or not if you want, I only explained their reasoning.
Well yeah, cause if X happened and Y did Z, and said "we did Z because of X" then I consider Z a reaction to X, you for some reason have a problem with that.
It was a reaction to the proposal to worsen the conditions of "security prisoners" by Ben Gvir, so my bet it was more a reaction than a planned start of war.
When we say "reaction" we imply that somehow Ben Gvir proposing (or dang it, even deciding to) worsen the conditions of terrorist in jail is a rational reason to shoot rockets at civilians. Those two aren't really logically related any more than the Mafia threatening to kill a police officer who's putting a criminal in jail.
You stated "it was a reaction". Unless your job is to parrot their propaganda I'm not sure how you could claim to be explaining something while simultaneously saying "go ask them".
