There is no audit per se. It could be a running look over by irs or whoever, but it wouldn't go on for that long if it was serious, and if it's an irs audit going on that long you sure know they don't trust him with the accounts. But like I said, it's just a way for him to pretend he couldn't release them, when Gee, every other candidate finds a way to release their taxes for years during every campaign.
It’ll be awkward when Republicans have to argue “He committed tax fraud because he’s smart enough to exploit the system, but none of you should do what we praise him for.”.
I think what actually makes me the most angry is that we all know he's committed tax fraud and various financial crimes, and that the IRS has all of this proof and has never done anything about it themselves.
His taxes are likely just embarrassing for him, exposing how he's not nearly as rich as he claims. If instead there are crimes revealed, then that's yet more long, drawn out cases to add to the pile.
Unless he dies, the Show has possibly a decade of seasons left, just considering the number and complexity of the legal cases against him, the speed at which the system typically proceeds, and Trump's expected strategy of appeal and delay.
