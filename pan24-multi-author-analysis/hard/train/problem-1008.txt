They won't touch it hate him or not because it pisses off just enough people to ensure they might lose in the future. The elections are too close anymore. Plus regardless of whether they hate Trump or not this sort of thing is unpopular with Conservative voters anyways.
There's already dissention in the GOP ranks between supporting DeSantis or Trump. The mainstay GOP wants DeSantis as the nomination, but they don't want backlash from Trump's core group of diehard supporters.
Actually my favorite outcome would be Desantis gets the GOP nomination, then Trump runs as an Independent and splits the right’s voter pool, thus causing them to lose as well.
2) it does not get passed and trump losses the Republican primary thus runs independent/destroys the Republican party’s chances of 2024 with a split vote.
1) it gets passed with bipartisan support in the senate. This causes trumps base to go crazy and try to fuck over the GOP in the next election either by not voting or voting libertarian.
If Trump is barred from running by Democrats, it literally gives the GOP exactly what they want. They have a reason for running DeSantis over Trump, and can actually take advantage of Trump's core supporters while blaming Democrats for overreach. This will literally pull all the GOP groups together behind DeSantis, the GOP's favored candidate, while Dems will have to scramble to get a candidate capable of defeating him.
2024 is already going to be an uphill battle, but there's a chance with Trump/DeSantis fracturing the GOP voting bloc. Something like this is literally giving them exactly the win they want, and it is so mind-numbingly fucking stupid to do.
