Even if these nations are all gone, I'm sure other adversaries will emerge. I can't imagine a world where the top superpower doesn't have any enemies.
Considering that the top superpower has a knack of being rather dangerous to any peace which doesn't feed her superrich.. yeah, plenty of adversaries will emerge.
And "the west" (not all of the west - the imperialist part of the west) is invading all countries which pose a perceived financial threat. Or they are propping up dictators which are either deemed friendly or necessary for stability.
It is a balant lie to assume that we are always the good guys. We are not. It is just that Russia is about always the bad guys in teh last few decades.
I wonder how much the west would have united without the threat of Russia post-WWII. Of course not wanting another major war was the biggest goal but having a hostile nuclear power right there certainly helps bring people together. Just wondering if true world peace is achievable or if there will just be an inevitable whack-a-mole of hostile powers no matter how many technological and agricultural advances we make.
