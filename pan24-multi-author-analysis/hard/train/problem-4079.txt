And in fact, in the last two elections, they didn't even get the single largest share of the popular vote. 2019 and 2021 more Canadians voted for the CPC, and the vast majority of Canadians voted for a party other than the LPC.
The LPC has won a single majority since 2015, and to accomplish that they required the votes of only 27.65% of eligible Canadians.
Its been almost 50 years since the last time a party in Canada has won over 50% support. Its a broken system, and maybe if we had one that forced parties to work together to pass legislation, we'd have a less divisive political atmosphere, with tangible results for Canadians.
No, I think we should have a Parliament that proportionally represents how all Canadians vote if we want to call ourselves a democracy. Not one that due to design can grant almost absolute power to a specific party, with less than 30% of the electorate voting for them.
Plus there's 5 viable federal parties for people to choose from, so the odds of over 50% of voters casting ballots for a single party are exceedingly slim.
