I work with teachers and I love them all dearly... but some of them have to consistently ask the students, "Does anyone see where I put the dry erase marker? Help me find it." One of our schools uses harmonicas as a way to calmly signal the students to quiet down and listen. Half the teachers put their harmonica down and forget where it is. This isn't a commentary on their intelligence; it's a commentary on how many plates they're spinning at the same time.
Just wait until the Phys Ed teacher forgets her gun on top of the lockers, or the chemistry teacher opens the classroom gun safe and forgets to close it properly.
I guess the kindergarten teacher who was recently shot by one of her students, would have been able to shoot the kid back if she had had a firearm. The right would have hailed the situation as an example of a “ good guy with a gun”.
The rare time police have responded to a shooting where a good guy with a gun actually stopped the shooting, they killed them. Having more guns just increases the chaos. It’s not a common occurrence that a random good guy with a gun actually stops a shooting. This is going to make teachers initial targets. Not to mention the hostile environment of having a gun in the classroom.
