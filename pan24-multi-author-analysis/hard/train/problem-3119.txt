A triple homicide and killing a bicyclist who ran a red light aren’t the same thing. Maybe it was intentional. Investigate. But those aren’t yet equivalent. And should be treated differently.
I’m sure most people are making judgements based on their ‘side’ but the situations are also different so it’s important to point that out. They may be revealed to be quite similar. But for now they very much aren’t. And the media is really bad at helping people see those differences. I personally think biden has been significantly better as a president than I expected but if it turns out he did something malicious similar to what it appears trump did, “lock h[im] up”. If he didn’t do anything malicious I’d hate for trump to get yet another pass as a corrupt piece of shit just because of optics that the media shaped for the American people in an objectively wrong direction.
If biden DID maliciously take documents and hide more. Fuck him. Jail. But trump did something that as of now is FAR worse and shouldn’t get a pass because Biden did something that could be similar.
Now this doesn't address that Biden is obviously responding completely different than Trump and cooperating but it does undermine the idea that what Trump did is unusual.
While the response from the individual parties is vastly different it does undermine certain positions that Trump having documents at Mar-a-Lago was unusual in the first place. Biden now likely had Top Secret documents at the highest level in 2+ offices in boxes as was apparently completely unaware, but there was a big narrative that having these documents in personal residences was unusual when it was clearly not.
