Yeah but why would we? Last I checked we are sitting at 1 million refugees and like 400 tanks sent to Ukraine. Feel free to deliver an aircraft carrier filled to brim with strategic bombers if you think it can pass through our borders and can help in beating Russia. Absolutely nobody would oppose the idea and you probably could even do it without anyone finding out until it's already in use (Polish forums specifically tell people NOT TO share any pics/videos of anything military related that goes to Ukraine).
You get everyone sane to leave and make a new pact that says "NATOv2". Now Hungary is all alone in NATO since it didn't get an invite.
in other words, Hungary was going to get territory but wasn't going to participate inthe "force" aprt.
2/3 of its territory wasn't populated by Hungarians though. It was populated by people who by and large, were colonized by Austria-Hungary. that is the root of the issue.
After a genocidal war has started, and all of the prejudices, fears and paranoias about russia have become validated. the Polish hate-boner for Russia is far stronger than it's value of keeping Hungary as a friend, when Hungary is supporting Russia.
Hungary isn't Turkey, it's not a strategically relevant nation, Orban either has some friends in high places in EU or trusts Putin way too much for him to behave like that.
Fortunately for Europe, and unlike Hungary, Poland didn't forget that Russia can never be trusted, and they didn't spread their cheeks for Rosneft and Gazprom money like Budapest did.
If EU politicians had a backbone they'd at least have Ukraine cut off Hungary from Russian blood gas, and economically embargo Hungary as much as is legally possible if we can't kick them out.
Hungary is affiliated with an enemy of an alliance, they shouldn't be part of it, and if they can't be kicked, that's a flaw in system.
