Ukraine will never invade Russia. They would absolutely get nuked in that situation, and the West would have a hard time justifying a hard response, since Russia would be hitting their own globally accepted territory.
It's a lot easier with German tanks, but Poland has Abrams and mechanics that are probably VERY good at their jobs and will almost certainly be earning their pay training Ukrainian techs.
The US should be outfitting Poland with everything we can since they're probably going to be Russia's next target if Ukraine falls.
Hopefully Ukraine will be given plenty of werstern tanks for their next major offensives to blast ruzzian fascists with.
So what, they're also facing British, American, and Soviet tanks. And this time the German tanks are being used to defend Ukraine, whereas last time they were used to invade it.
Also I hear Ukrainians say they're facing Russian tanks again, only the first time didn't happen 80 years ago, more like 8.
Nonaggression treaty, glory seeking maniac stabbing his neighbor in the back after promising never to invade them.. sounds familiar I gotta say.
