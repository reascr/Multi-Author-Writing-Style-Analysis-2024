Always have; It was a big part of why people fought against NAFTA. US floods Mexican corn market with subsidised corn, undercutting local growers. It's also why so many Mexican farmers turned to more lucrative crops and fed the drug trade.
And when Mexican farmers can not make a subsistence living growing a little bit of corn due to greedy agribusiness, what do they do? They immigrate north.
Mexico basically created today's 'corn' from what was a field grass. There are over 20,000 distinct Mexican corn varieties. In the US we primarily grow 'Yellow Dent' corn for industrial use which constitutes about 98% of the corn acreage planted.
The result after decades of innovation: America produces too much corn. We put high fructose corn syrup in almost all foods. We decree that gasoline must be 10% ethanol even though it's less efficient than pure gasoline. We give away corn to developing countries as food aid.
Some context here. In the 1970s Secretary of Agricultural Earl Butz replaced the farm subsidy that paid farmers to limit their crop production with a farm subsidy that paid farmers to produce as much corn as they could.
Also, American farmland has been optimized for giant fields instead of the smaller segmented fields with borders that lessen erosion and provide wildlife habitat.
