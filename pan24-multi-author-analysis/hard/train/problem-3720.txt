"'Older prisoners only had to show they could march a few yards' to be recruited, one of the fighters said.
"'Ukrainians with real combat experience will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots,' Zelensky said.".
Which is what I said. But almost 200k civilians were killed due to the actions of US troops in Afghanistan alone, whether on purpose or not that's unacceptable. It's not an apples to apples comparison but I think they're still comparable.
While I 100% agree that the Russians responsible for these acts are criminals and should she punished appropriately, having the US government call them out is the teapot calling the kettle black.
You're right though the media is telling you to hate Russia without thinking of its similarities to the US or the horrible list of human rights abuses the US has committed even in the past decade alone. Hold the rest of the world to a higher standard than you do your own government. Get upset at the very thing your leaders do in private and admit to years after it happens with no consequence.
