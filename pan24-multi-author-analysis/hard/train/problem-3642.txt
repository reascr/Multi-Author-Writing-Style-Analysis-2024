Right wing people have decided that this means that the entire thing was fake. Because every single one of them is a depraved and dishonest piece of shit that will say I do anything in order to justify any violence against people who are not part of their group.
That thing is nothing but a shameless murderer too cowardly to actually kill anybody so instead he just offends those who actually engage in the violence he just fantasizes about.
The number of undercover agents used to find these lunatics is well worth it, then, I can't imagine any halfway sane person being talked into going out to kidnap and murder someone because they resented having to wear a mask. It's not like some high school kids getting taked into shoplifting a six-pack of beer.
I get that it can seem humorous from a certain angle at the number of undercover agents in any one case. But certainly, the police don't say, "We better cut down on our undercover cops, we don't want to encourage pushers to sell crack.".
i would say, yes absolutely. Look at all the far right militias workng on their own without any FBI presence. The FBI didn't organize and bus in and rile up the January 6 insurrectionists, that was all Trump and his supporters in government. Saying that these domestic terrorists wouldn't act if the FBI hadn't instigated them is being dangerously disingenuous in my opinion.
Oh, well then, one FBI informant in a lynch mob of six thousand. He must have been very busy to get that crowd together.And of course, since then the FBI has rounded up and charged hundreds of the terrorists (some of whom are FINALLY getting prison sentences, although pretty lenient ones considering what they did).
