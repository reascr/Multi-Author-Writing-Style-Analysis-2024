Read about what? I am sure there are ways you can check by whom russian tankers are being insured at the moment. And which countries accept those insurance certificates.
Insurance is required yes. For any cargo ship. But I fail to see the point of why would Russian ships be even attempting to insure their cargo in a western company.
Lastly, if something bad happens to one of the ships a western insurer would likely stop insuring russian ships altogether. A russian insurer, under the orders of putin, might continue to insure the ships no matter how many of them crash and burn. And the insurance will be paid in rubles which has no benefit to the west whatsoever.
Insurance is required because these are russian ships, which are old unreliable undermanned and poorly trained. An oil spill is much more likely than any other ship.
An oil spill in the Bosphorus would be worse. is home to some 16 million people. It would be an ecological and humanitarian catastrophe. No transit via ships, no fishing no cross strait ferries.
