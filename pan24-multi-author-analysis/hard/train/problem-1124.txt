EU has literally zero jurisdiction when it comes to price controls in Croatia, there's no EU "economic ministry" either. There's ECB (european central bank), but neither them nor Croatian central bank can really do anything about shops gouging their customers. Both institutions done their job when it comes to the "big picture" of switching currencies, like agreeing on exchange rate, making sure there's enough physical cash in circulation, preparing banks for the switch, making sure prices are displayed in dual currencies (HRK and Euro in this case) etc...
That said, shit like this happened in pretty much all countries that switched to Euro to various extent though, in some countries it was worse than others.
I did a little googling and I found from 2005 (3 years after the country converted solely to Euro)...
It has nothing to do with the Euro. Just greedy retailers seeing an opportunity to rip people off with overinflated prices in the confusion of conversion.
This has nothing to do with Euro itself, it's just opportunistic businesses using the situation to rip people off.
