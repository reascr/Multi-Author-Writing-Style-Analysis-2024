The US has over 1,200 in storage. Not all of them could be restored to active service but enough could to stick it to the Russians.
And we dont necessarily need to supply F16. Poland will consider the , which are in service with the Polish army, to Ukraine.
And? The aircraft that Ukraine are currently using are even older than the F-16 NATO could supply and less capable than the Russian aircraft.
The primary air defense of Russia is a decade older than the f16, it was designed specifically with Russian air defense in mind. The Ukrainians have been doing fairly well with older airframes.
F16s go astray? Never been shot down though. What part of this conflict makes you think weapons on the hand of Russians will be any more effective than in the hands of an Arab? The Russians are currently firing s300 rockets into apartment buildingsâ€¦.
If the Ukrainians are getting shot out of the skies it sounds like they need better planes then huh?
Ukraine already has an air force and pilots, they only need to be trained on new equipment, not sent through Basic. It's the same as IFVs and MBTs; Ukraine already has tankers.
