Kathy Griffin. What's interesting about that is that Democrats didn't rally to defend her. The joke was in poor taste and she was rightly called out for it. Also worth noting is that Kathy Griffin does not have the ability to bring about the violence she joked about. MTG is a member of congress who has actual institutional power. It's a very different kind of joke when you have the power to potentially make it happen.
For argument's sake let's give her the benefit of the doubt and say it was a joke. She joked that she would have made sure the rioters were armed so that they could successfully murder members of congress. Do you think Republicans would excuse a Democrat for joking about murdering Republicans?
Why is it that these republicans are always joking when they make these remarks but when a democrat says something (equivalent in outrage (fake outrage that is)) how dare them?
So "a joke" is defined as something that disgusts and outrages the sane members of society and makes the crazy right wingers all cheer, but lacks any element of humor?
Conservatives are so unfunny and have such a fucked sense of humor that they can use "it was a joke" as an excuse and not have to worry about their "joke" being funny or having a punchline.
