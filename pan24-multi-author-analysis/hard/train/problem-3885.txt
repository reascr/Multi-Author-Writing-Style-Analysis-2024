The numbers skew up not down on which group is getting to the polls, and I think too young of a Millennial will push the wrong buttons on the 50+yo that are Independent voters to the right.
Sinema will get less than 2.4% of the total vote, and that none of those voters who previously voted for her will vote Republican instead of a progressive Democrat.
So in a race between Sinema and a Republican, Sinema wins by 60k votes (2.4%). What you are telling me is that in a race with Sinema, a Progressive Democrat and a Republican, that the incumbent will get less than 2.4% of the vote (with the rest of there support going to the Dem), or that a progressive will somehow win Republican voters over?
Depending on whether Sinema runs for reelection as a Republican or who the Republicans put against her, she could end up taking more votes from the Republican candidate than the Democrat.
She has a higher favorability rating among Republicans than Democrats in her state, so yes, there will be Republicans who would vote for her as an independent. Especially if Republicans decide to run a nutjob.
