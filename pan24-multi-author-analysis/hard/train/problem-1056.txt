Easily two of the top greatest emotional traumaz someone can go through is abandonment or banishment from one's own "in-group", and enduring life or death violence.
These police were betrayed their fellow police officers, as well as betrayed by the fellow American citizens who fell on them in a filthy mob.
If police did die, they'd just say "well only X number did" or "well only the cowardly/traitorous ones", because their position is that they are always right, quick someone bullshit a justification, so fuck em all together.
Similarly, if that same cop chose to take on the mob, got beaten to a pulp and died a week later in the hospital, we'd agree that was in the line of duty even though he didn't actually die while "at work" right?
If the police officer saw a mob of people coming down the hallway chanting hang Mike Pence and decided to shoot themselves instead of being ripped apart by the mob, we'd agree that death was in the line of duty, right?
It’s incredible that for all the leg humping republicans do of law enforcement, they hadn’t done a thing for the families who are stranded following a police officer suicide.p.
