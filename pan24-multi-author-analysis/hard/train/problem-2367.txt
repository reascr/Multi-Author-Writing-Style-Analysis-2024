I’m thinking it would be virtually impossible. Even if you could convince enough players and clubs to form a rival league, there is no way you could compete with the sponsorship and TV money that FIFA has access to. Host countries and stadiums value money over principle.
I’m sure, if the players in question had a choice, they would gladly relocate the games to a less repressive country. But, they can’t. It is massively unfair to tell these players to give up probably the only moment in the global spotlight that they’ll ever have, because the host country does not agree with their values.
Will football fans make a stand against FIFA and teams who willingly participate in this shit, or are they going to choose the path of selective hearing and ignore the monstrosities that are being played out right in front of us?
Secondly I know the teams would never withdraw like I said they should, they're in the business of playing soccer/football and there would be all sorts of negative lasting repercussions for the national teams and the individuals involved, and probably a tiny minority of players would even want to consider boycotting...I just don't see any other truly meaningful way for FIFA to be held responsible for their ethical corruption.
I think the salient question here is, "Will FIFA deliberately not play in/withdraw from a country or community that does not respect basic human rights?".
True. But they decided to compete to host an international sporting event. It's not like hordes of exposed-shoulder, rainbow flag waving fans randomly showed up at the airport one day.
