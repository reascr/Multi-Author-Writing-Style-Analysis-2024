Some of it, but there are other factors as well. We lost a ton of childcare providers during the pandemic because yes, shit pay and lack of financial safety net, but also death and retirement. The other issue is the cost of the certification and education needed. We want qualified, educated people watching our kids, but we need to pay them accordingly and provide funding to deal with student loan debt.
There are a number of programs being staged up at the state and federal level to support childcare. The biggest problem we’re having is finding trained and certified workers, so we’re also funding workforce training. Unfortunately, until we can get childcare workers back in the game, costs will likely stay high.
That means everyone has to work for food/money and having a place to live in ALSO costs a lot of money now.
Of course birth rates go down when having kids creates an existential dilemma, maybe even an existential crisis. Raising kids is work, a lot of stressful work.
Sometimes a parent can't afford to work and care for their child at the same time. Sometimes a couple can't afford to have a parent stay home and watch the child.
That’s not always an option for families that need both incomes. And not all childcare places are institutions. Childcare cooperatives and relief nurseries, for example, show major benefits in the lonerm health and development of kids.
