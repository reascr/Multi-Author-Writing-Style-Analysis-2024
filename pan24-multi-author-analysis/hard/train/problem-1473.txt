Does that mean most Israelis agree with the egregious comments and actions made by their leaders? The current coalition is particularly bad in this regard.
What about Palestinian Christians who are overwhelmingly anti-Israel? Do you have some other excuse for dehumanising them since they're not Muslim? Also do you think Arab-Muslims in Israel who make up 20% of the population should be allowed to vote?
To your last question - if they wanna be part of the Israeli society, that just want to live in peace, and not praise the killing of jews, I more than welcome them to be able to vote.
Ofc I didn't mean ALL Palestinians, and some do want democracy, but like I said, if most wanted it, they would have had it by now.
The Palestinians don't want democracy at all. And for sure not a democracy with Israel or with jews.
wtf, like Israel has had no role in the prevention of a Palestinian democracy? That's literally Netanyahu (and Sharone's, and ...) life's work, preventing a functioning Palestinian state.
