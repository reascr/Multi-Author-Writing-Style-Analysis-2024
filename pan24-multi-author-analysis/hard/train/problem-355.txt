She was also mentally developed enough to complete the requirements for her degree, she knew what she was getting into, and she jumped in with both feet until it was clear that there would be consequences for doing so.
Bottom line; whether she fully or not all understood what she was doing when she got there, jumped in with both feet as you said, she still decided to the right thing in the end, even if it was just for herself.

We can sit here and talked about adult or not, smart or not, maturity level, blah blah. But there still is going to be that huge gap between people starting their career and adult life - beginning to figure out life and how the REAL world works - making mistakes VS 60 year olds that already know how shit works - intent to break law - attempt a coup - have enough power to pressure/force those below them and use that power to threaten the safety and lives of those that resist.
