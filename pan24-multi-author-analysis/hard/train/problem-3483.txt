I live in Idaho. People complain about California transplants constantly. Republicans complain they're "bringing their liberal politics here and ruining Idaho!".
That's the thing. California conservatives feel the NEED to be Uber conservative in order to make up for the state that they live in.
I am in a more rural part of California that leans conservative. We also have a good state college in the county. Because of that, we have a higher young population then our size normally would.
I have seen a mix of people move out of state. It's always because of cost of living. Where they move is def based on political leanings. The thing most don't get is, a California conservative is probably more liberal then a lot of other places conservatives.
CA Dems aren't the left-most as conservative media makes it sound, and CA GOP have been going even more right in the last 10 years -- its not adding up to the voters.
Arnold is GOP, but he's about the left most leaning GOP candidate you can think of. Even at the time he was elected, he was practically considered a RINO. The CA recall process is also a bit too easy to accomplish, and that year was filled with a wild amount of candidates.
