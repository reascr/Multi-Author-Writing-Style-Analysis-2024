That's again comparing a presidential race to a midterm race. The enthusiasm and turnout levels are completely different. Way more people voted in that district in 2020, because of the presidential race also happening, then turned out to vote this time. 30k more people voted for the loser in that district in 2020 than voted for the winner in 2022.
You could also look at how fiach had 30k less votes than the democratic challenger in 2020. Not seeing any conclusions drawn about dissatisfaction there. It's the midterms. It's not enough data to go on for a presidential election year.
Confusing disinterest in midterms for overall dissatisfaction is a mistake. That's making a very colossal assumption about why people didn't vote in the midterms that ignores the usual reasons why people don't vote in the midterms.
Midterms account for some swing in turnout, sure, but you can't account for a 500-vote difference by saying "Well, it's a midterm". There's something else going on with that. Nor does it explain Boebert doing worse in every county in her district than every other Republican candidate except Ganahl.
If you'd asked me a week beforehand, I would have guessed that Boebert had about the same chance of being ousted as MTG. There might actually be a chance in 2024, though.
I wouldn't say it'd be exactly like this in 2024. But there's a chance for a pickup here if actual resources are devoted to the race.
