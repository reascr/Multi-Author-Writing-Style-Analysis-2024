It's 100% virtue signaling to his constituents in Utah. Porn 'addiction' rates are really high here, there are billboards all over the place with help lines to call if you're addicted to porn.
Utah has the highest porn consumption but also the most outrage about porn. Mormons are super against porn and a lot of the porn users there are shamed for it if found out. It’s super taboo. They literally treat it like heroin and have substance abuse programs specifically for porn.
Yeah Utah basically views porn like most places view drugs. They even preach about how addictive it is and have substance abuse programs devoted to overcoming porn use.
My drunkin coworker relies heavily on porn to help replace the sex he never gets. I do not need him frustrated in this manner. Alcohol has killed his imagination so he needs fresh porn from an outside source.
There is a big problem concerning porn and the conservative mind. Porn is their reference point concerning sexuality. Listen closely to note how they connect the dots. It’s sad they have little reference to reality!
