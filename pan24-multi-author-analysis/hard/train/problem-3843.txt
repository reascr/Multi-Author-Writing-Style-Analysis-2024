Most countries have birthright citizenship, and nothing I said is even disputed by Cruz. Cruz was born in Canada to an American mother and cuban father.
Right it works a little differently, but if he'd have stayed in Germany there is definitely an amount of time after which he could become a German citizen. Either way it's got nothing to do with Ted Cruz being born in Canada and the Obama birther thing being bullshit on every single level.
He also ran for president even though he was born in Canada to a non American father.. and a big chunk of the republican party forgot the whole birther thing completely. Republican and hypocrite are the same thing.
Senators always are hypocrites on this issue, and most of them are Republicans. Susan Collins, when she was first running for Senate 26 years ago, pledged to only serve two terms. Orrin Hatch, when he was first running for Senate, said this about his opponent: "What do you call a Senator who's served in office for 18 years? You call him home." Hatch went on to serve in the Senate for 42 years.
