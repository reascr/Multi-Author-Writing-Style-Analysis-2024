If Putin was relying on the esprit de corps to, because he was a former member, keep the FSB rank and file on his side (the guy who has been "the boss" for more than a decade), his very public dressing down of the head of the FSB early on for the invasion failures (rather than, you know, the corruption that starts at the very top and drained the military of its power) would've cement him as "not one of us" in many minds and maybe even as "the biggest danger to Russia" amongst those FSB members who are genuine patriots.
I mean there are many within those agencies that are leaking (the entire apparatus of the invasion itself was practically given to the Five Eyes it seems) and we are at a phase now that Russian internal opposition to further blunders (from within its own security services) is likely at critical mass.
Could legit ask this about any Russian dissident with a lot more "clout" than Sushko (who I don't even think is a dissident).
ex KGB are the only ones Putin trusts, if these two people have plotted against Putin, then they either have ex KGB backing or they will be disposed of.
Nothing new... it's been going on for years.. Putin eliminates those that get in the way... mysterious deaths , sudden heart attacks , bogus charges , falling out of windows " accidently " who in their right mind believe any of their concocted lies.
The Kremlin is steeped in corruption and paranoia . The russian citizens live in fear never knowing what will happen in their evil police state Utopia.
