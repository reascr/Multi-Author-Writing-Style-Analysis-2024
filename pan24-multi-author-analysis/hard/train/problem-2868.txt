As a Brit, I honestly do not understand why the American right's obsession with guns is so significant that they'd be willing to take it this far. In virtually any other country, regardless of political position, this would seem like an obviously bad idea.
You realise only a very small portion of Republicans attended the Jan 6th insurrection, right? And almost no one in government supported it? Trump literally had his own people turning against him over his election denial.
Are you suggesting Republicans want to allow minors to carry guns because they want black children to be murdered? If not, I don't know where you're going with this...
Wanting an explanation doesn't mean I'm going to agree with any explanation given. What if you responded saying: "The reason Americans are so obsessed with guns is actually because Julie Andrews is secretly the leader of the Illuminati and it heavily influences people at all levels to champion gun rights in order to overthrow the government.".
Yes. They are fascists. After January 6th we'd all be absolute fools to think they are after anything other than an authoritarian form of government. History is repeating itself.
