Xi does not want to trade China's biggest export market for cooperating with what's left of Russia. Even Putin should understand this (but obviously not).
Man, I’m beginning to think Putin is a fucking idiot. China knows the key to a new Sino dominated century is the West. There’s no getting around that fact. He thinks Xi is going to abandon or jeopardize EU/US trade relations for Russia? Lol. Fucking idiot.
He’s hoping Russia can pay China in oil and in return China will settle the transactions in Yuan so that Russia can buy munitions. China isn’t going to do it. If they do, the US/EU will cut off their market access and do some crazy shit like exit WTO.
Absolutely not. This is a monumental misunderstanding of Chinese foreign policy. The minute China pays Russia in Yuan for oil and NG is the minute the US and EU sanction China. Over 50% of the export market. It would be disastrous to the Chinese economy.
Just keep investing in China and keep your supply chains in this hostile county notwithstanding they want to destroy the western world order.
If the West sanctioned China it would be the worst hit to the economy ever and they can't afford it. That's why they followed the western sanctions on Russia.
Not really. China produces a lot of things, but only because the west provides WHAT and HOW. And mainly because they can SELL it to the West.
