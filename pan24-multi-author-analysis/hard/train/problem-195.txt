China and India view each other as key threats. The minor extent China and Russia support each other is because they'd rather the US/EU aren't the only game in town. South Africa isn't a notable military power at all.
South Africa isnt siding with Russia. They are just not siding with anyone and continuing on with their lives. When Swiss do it, oh they are so quirky. When South Africa does it, eviiiiiil.
For me it comes down to, do you want to understand an African country and understand their motivations and history and why they act the way they do? No? You just want to call them evil, then thats racism.
An african country decides to not follow US/europe hegemony and do drills with a country that is investing a lot into them without crazy conditions, and a country that supported them during apartheid while the US supported the white govt: they are the axis of evil.
If we need to understand the history and motivations of the countries in Africa apoplexy call evil itâ€™s only fair to do the same thing for the people making the accusations.
No, but people just always say African countries are evil and its kinda thrown with no legit reasons. My family of old south africans all say the exact same shit all the time about how the ANC is evil, etc etc and I promise you, they are incredibly racist.
Before implying your old South African family members that think the ANC is evil are racist you should consider what they had to go through during the decades of fighting between the ANC and Apartheid.
