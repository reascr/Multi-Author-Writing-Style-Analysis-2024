I can't wait for the vote to take place, it'll be nice to not have to worry on behalf of so many people that I know and care about.
I want to be clear that this sucks balls, but right now, with the votes we have, our options are "don't protect ourselves at all" and "at least make sure that our marriages remain acknowledged once SCOTUS does what we all know they're going to do".
That said, it does NOT guarantee the rights of people in conservative states to get married should Obgerfell get overturned :
The is good enough because if/when the Supreme Court strikes down Obergefell, any same sex marriage can be disregarded by an anti-LGBTQ state. This makes sure any legal marriages are still recognized by every state.
It's not forcing every state to legalize it, but it is forcing states to recognize married couples as such.
Edit: Yes, it's forcing states to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from states that do issue them.
The only reason this is getting anywhere in the Senate is because it's not forcing states to recognize issue same-sex marriage licenses.
The law this is replacing, the Defense of Marriage Act, basically just allowed states to recognize same-sex marriage, but it wasn't recognized federally, and it was only recognized at the state-level in states which opted to do so. In other words, it was basically a republican law that gave a little wiggle room to democrats.
As far as I can tell, the Respect for Marriage Act is a democrat law that gives a little wiggle room to republicans. The only concession republican states get is that they can ban same-sex marriage, but they have to recognize out-of-state marriages regardless.
