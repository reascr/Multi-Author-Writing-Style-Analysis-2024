Beginning with Turco et al in 1983, nuclear winter models typically use an assumption that 100+ Tg (often 150+) of "black carbon" soot will be launched into the upper atmosphere. It's hard to say what we'd actually see, but we effectively started the conversation from the hypothetical of "what if we vaporized every major city on the planet and put that smoke in the worst possible place?".
<50 Tg displacements would still see major disruptions across the world and induce global food crises even if supply chains weren't touched, but it's really unlikely we'd see anything like a years-on-end twilight that resembles the classic depiction of a "nuclear winter.".
Said this once and will say it again. How does everyone see this war ending? Either it'll be an infinite stalemate, or at some point Putin launches nukes because there's literally nothing left to do.
So long as Putin keeps openly discussing using nuclear weapons, I think the world should feel safe when they stop Saber rattling or say the weapons are absolutely off the table, that's when it's time to be scared.
(Bloomberg) --Vladimir Putin said Russia may consider formally adding the possibility of a preventive nuclear first strike to disarm an opponent to its military doctrine, just days after warning that the risk of atomic war is rising. “We’re thinking about this,” the Russian president told reporters after a summit in Kyrgyzstan. “If we are talking about a disarming strike, perhaps we should think about using the approaches of our American partners,” he said, citing what he called US strategies to use high-accuracy missiles for a preventive strike.
The US and its allies have denounced Putin for what they call nuclear saber-rattling over his invasion of Ukraine. Russia blames the West for raising the issue first, although Kremlin officials began the threats.
