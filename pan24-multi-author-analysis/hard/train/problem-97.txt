Not that simple though. In the post Mao era, the idea was that closer economic trade with a country would eventually lead to democracy or at least good improvement on human rights. And it worked in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Eastern Europe. But China and Russia showed that it wont' work with larger countries that have economic pull -- China with their massive economy and Russia with their oil and gas influence and power.
"now". That was 2005. And that his attempt to find a solution that might actually work -- they really want independence but that's not going to happen. So he aims for autonomy. Which is why "The Dalai Lama also stated in 2008 that he wishes only for Tibetan autonomy, and not separation from China, under certain conditions, like freedom of speech and expression, genuine self-rule, and control over ethnic makeup and migration in all areas claimed as historical Tibet".
Iâ€™d love if Tibetans had more autonomy and the CCP respected human rights for ALL citizens but that just wont happen in any world or any near alternate realities.
In Korea and Taiwan, the US forced those countries to democratize when democracy movements rose because the US threatened to remove foreign aid and make those governments vulnerable to China. Whether or not it was an empty threat or not, it made those government capitulate as they had no chance defending against China without America's help.
I agree that it's de facto China, but it's a delicate topic as it encourages a country to pacify a demographic militarily.
Why I am positive every country has its share of hypocrisy, China is the only one that reserves a considerable amount of its people as enforcers. I mean, secret police, secret police stations IN other countries, cheating and theft of many IP and have a culture that think stealing isn't stealing.
