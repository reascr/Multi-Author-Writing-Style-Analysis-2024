There is plenty of violence - but there are very special places that ask you for firearms. Total holes in the wall that you should not be in, and fancy places trying to make sure some rich dumb ass doesnâ€™t drink and shoot a client.
Somehow you all think that a county being raped for 50 plus years of resources just magically comes right over night.
We spend the most money per capita on education - our country was fucked by half a century+ of apartheid. No one is kept dumb our country was broken during apartheid where all the whites would have gotten treated differently.
Not to say that there are no political issues affecting whites that are ignored/exacerbated by the government but it's delusional to compare it to apartheid South Africa.
Some friends who visited from South Africa described it as apartheid turned up side down, another words the whites are now being treated like the blacks were treated pre Mandela but now itâ€™s not safe to be white and in South Africa, also said the place is riddled with corruption at every level. I wonder is that why they are getting on so well with the Russians ðŸ«¢.
But Russia is. Hence people not being happy with countries doing things with the country. I mean when Russia needs to cosy up to North Korea, perhaps not best to be counted as their friends.
