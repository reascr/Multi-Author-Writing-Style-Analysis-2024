I think the only places where the “boycott the World Cup” campaign got any tracking was in Europe and, as ever, the World Cup is delivering record-breaking numbers in all European countries. I think like 1/3 of French people said they were less interested in the World Cup because where it was taken place and yet literally everyone’s watching.
It’s like the NFL celebrating the Super Bowl is the most watched event of the year in the USA. Like, no shit, that’s obvious.
Yup, proves my point. Lower actual numbers, but more interesting: a much lower market share (48% vs 69%). So even though it was played at a much more attractive time for TV (because the total market was much higher than in 2018), it had a significantly lower share of that market.
It's very entertaining to read this. It's constantly self-referencing, or talking about breaking records from earlier in the same World Cup. Like more people watching France's second game than their first, record broken, woohoo!
Idk, i have seen the least enthusiasm for this world cup ever. And because of winter, everyone is at work when there are games, so meh. But I guess europe isn’t really fifas audience anymore.
