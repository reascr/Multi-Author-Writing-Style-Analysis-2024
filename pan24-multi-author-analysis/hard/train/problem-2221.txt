This suggests that those 18-24 _don't_ have families to care for, which doesn't necessarily seem to be the case. , and I think first kids are probably the hardest on new parents' schedule (particularly when said kids are still infants/toddlers and need the most care/supervision).
Would also note how many in this group might have any combination of further education, young kids, shitty job, debt, or poor housing situation to worry about.
Also, would note that the transition from low to high voting rate isn't some kind of cliff. Each older age group votes more than the next younger group, and so on.
Also, how young are you that you think people ages 65-70 are just sitting around all day waiting to vote? And they're all watching Fox? I'll let Bernie know. ðŸ˜‚.
>Voter turnout was highest among those ages 65 to 74 at 76.0%, while the percentage was lowest among those ages 18 to 24 at 51.4%. Overall, voter turnout increased as age increased.
Young people are voting at higher rates than usual. And now the entire under 45 demographic leans to the left. GOP knows they're on a time limit in terms of being able to win elections, hence why they're working so hard to undermine voting rights and elections.
