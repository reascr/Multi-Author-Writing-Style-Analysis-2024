Like it's starting to feel like now that the anti Russia sentiment has died down a bit all these politicians that were ready to stand against Russia are now just as quickly ready to come to a concensus if that means it saves them money.
It does prolong the war because that further prevents Russia from making territorial gains and gives Ukraine a better chance.
With a supported Ukraine though, they can fight back and drive Russia out and end the war. Itâ€™s not even been a year and it already looks like it could be the beginning of the end.
Ukrainians dying in droves to resist their occupiers and Russians dying in droves trying to occupy a foreign nation. All this likely over a few decades until Russia gives up.
Russia want to annihilate Ukraine and the Ukrainian identity. So Ukraine cannot and will not give up. Even if Russia defeated and fully occupied a non-supported Ukraine you would probably see a long period of resistance afterwards in the form of protests, partisan/army guerrilla warfare.
