I'd like to call him Captain Obvious.... but he's right. This needs to be stated, over and over again. Russia will not win this war or any part of Ukraine.
It's not just about taking Ukrainian territory. It was betting that Ukraine would be a fait accompli that would discredit the whole system of international politics. Proof that Russia was still an empire and great power that deserved a sphere of influence where it controlled puppet states in which no foreign power could legitimately meddle, like during the cold war or the age of empires of the nineteenth century.
It was supposed to be an end of an era and the beginning of a new one where Russia and China could take their "rightful" place as leading nations in the face of a diminished and humiliated US. Appeasement would have proved him right. The US would have been diminished. Reliance on NATO and to a lesser extent the EU would have been proven to be a bad idea. It wouldn't have done everything Putin had hoped, but it would have been a masterstroke to put Russia back at the center of an Imperial system that they could exploit for money and manpower.
So, Russia demanded that NATO prohibit Ukraine from joining. This would break NATO since it would violate the founding arrangement and would require a complete rework of what NATO is. I mean if you break the Treaty that defines the Treaty Organization... If they didn't get that, then all they had to do was prove that it was toothless.
Remember the context here. NATO had been weakening for decades and Trump's isolationist turn began to undercut the trust that people had in NATO, because really the point of Article 5 is calling the US Army to defend Europe. Macron was also quite vocal about the need for an EU army to eliminate the dependence Europe has on the US. Germany was so sure that they had a special understanding with Russia that would allow them to negotiate. NATO was on the shakiest footing it'd been possibly ever.
