Florida should go back to being a swamp. The destruction of the natural state of that peninsula is absolutely mind-boggling.
And it was that way for a reason, before men came and paved it over. Why we continually choose to build in the absolute worst areas, I have no idea. Las Vegas, I'm looking at you...
There are parts of the US where local kids run around without shoes and are infested with hookworms. That's absolutely crazy, given how bad things need to be for that to happen.
It's such a ludicrous idea that the more you examine it, the worse it gets. There is zero chance that a "national divorce" would be pulled off without any fighting - either Second Civil War with the red states seceding or battles over what each new country gets and gives up.
This is a very important point. Suppose Greene got her wish and the US divided in two. Where would my state, New York, go? The Blue USA obviously, right? After all, New York is extremely blue. Except it isn't completely blue. Huge portions of rural New York are deep red. So they'd want to join Red USA. Meanwhile, blue counties in red states would object to being forced into Red USA.
Oh, the former red states would just blame the former blue states until it became a war. Red state problems are never caused by the shitheads they elect, it’s always California’s fault or something.
This seems to be something that people often forget about when thinking they’d try out their cheap red state for awhile and if it sucks they’d move to the country housing the blue states. Odds are you wouldn’t have that choice.
If it were to happen, you best get out immediately. Odds are there might be a short transition time, but you’d now be living in a foreign country when compared to the blue states. Just like Americans cannot just up and move to Canada, you couldn’t move from the Red States of America to the Blue States of America without meeting their specific immigration criteria.
