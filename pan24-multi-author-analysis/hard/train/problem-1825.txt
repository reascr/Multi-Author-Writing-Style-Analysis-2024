So, in short, supermassive black holes today are heavier than they should be according to previous theories. This is because the space that exists behind the event horizon also generates the same vacuum energy as the universe outside them, leading to the black hole just growing in mass from its own stretched space time?
This phenomenon would apply to all super massive blackholes, and since they are scattered around us in a relatively even distribution, we would see this expansion of spacetime phenomenon all around us, which is why we would see dark energy everywhere.

All supermassive blackholes are causing this effect within their local area, and thus dark energy appears to be uniform, because spacetime is being deformed around all supermassive blackholes that exist.

Edit: For example, how do we know supermassives and similarly large black holes aren't absorbing Dark Stars, other tiny black holes, etc? At the relative distances we wouldn't be able to be sure, etc.
