I'll point to people like Rush Limbaugh, the dude that many a Conservative looked up to and praised, specifically for what he said and did in reaction to people dying of HIV/AIDS.
Exactly my reaction too. That was the final straw for him? Really? Not any of the countless batshit or outright malicious policies from his "friends"?
Landlords, specifically the type that owns single family housing and rents it out, are literally using other people's income to pay the mortgages on those houses while making the renters pay more than the mortgage costs. They provide nothing, if they stopped being a landlord those houses would still exist on the market.
He literally celebrated the deaths of these people as content for his show. In other words, he used their deaths for profit, to further his career. Should we not live by the golden rule? Treat others as you wish to be treated? Where was Limbaugh's compassion? Where was Sen. Samuel Thompson's compassion all these years?!? And now the final straw for him was his "friends" thinking his age might compromise his ability to be an elected representative? THAT'S why I should have some compassion for him?
I will show them the same amount of compassion they have showed others. If that is not sufficient for you, perhaps you should question why they lack so much of it themselves.
