To maintain your card-carrying active church membership, periodic interviews with your Bishop are required. For adults, part of this interview is basically a financial audit to make sure you're tithing appropriately. For younger members, it is often an interrogation about your sex life. I'm not and have never been Mormon, but I have heard some HIDEOUS stories about young women being interrogated, shamed, insulted, etc. during these meetings. It often goes way beyond the usual priest/penitent subject matter, delving directly into the sexual activity/thoughts/fantasies of minors.
The mainstream (like their fundamentalist brothercousins) LDS Church has lay leadership and a rigid hierarchical structure. Basically every male is an "Elder," and at the head of each "ward" (basically a parish) is a lay "Bishop.".
I grew up Catholic so it takes a lot to shock me, but I never had a priest bring up masturbation in the confessional. Utah Mormonism in particular is on a whole 'nother level of sex cult craziness.
Utah contains some of the most majestic scenery on Earth and enough troubled Mormons to keep me away. (From a someone who grew up there and who would love to return in different circumstances.).
Yeah. This is exactly the weird creepy crap that highlights how this is all about hurting trans kids just to hurt them, and has nothing to do with "saving the children".
