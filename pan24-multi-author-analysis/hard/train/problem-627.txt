Looked at the Wikipedia page of this guy and definitely sketchy shit regarding this guy but you never know with Russia if they're making things up or what's the truth. Why did he have 80k of cash with him?
He had multiple passports and was caught with 80k in cash. He was caught at a hotel meeting with a KGB double agent. One could guess he was going to use that 80k to bribe the KGB double agent for classified information for the United States.
A spy is worth a lot more than the arms dealer who was going to be released in a couple years. Thats why people assume he's a spy because Putin refuses to give him up.
Arguments against him being a spy and the four passport thing. His brother ascribed Paul's acquisition of the passports to "probably a genealogical interest as much as anything.".
????????? “Accused of espionage” why would any American be angry at someone for spying our old arch nemesis Russia on behalf of our own government? What the fuck does that have to do with Trump? All of these comments make me want to pull my hair out.
