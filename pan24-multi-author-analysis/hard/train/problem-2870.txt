They said that while hard-selling the idea of shipping their own gas across an ocean at a markup. Not exactly a convincing or selfless pitch. The idea of economic entanglement ensuring peace was also heavily pushed by the US until the moment they realized they had natural gas to sell.
It's a world commodity market, when the US sell's it's natural gas it sells it at the rate dictated by the market. Yes the companies are making more because the prices are higher, but the US is also sending Billions in aid to Ukraine which offsets that gain substantially.
They go on in the article to say the US is making money on higher gas prices and selling more weapons.
I don't get it? The U.S.A. doesn't own it's own gas resources. They are owned by private/public companies. We are paying the higher prices... all of us in the world are paying higher prices.
Of course the US will sell more energy and at higher prices. Russia was effectively sanctioned out of market. Less supply means higher prices, and US along with other countries are filling in the gaps left by Russia. The US is profiting from that but so what? US didn’t create this circumstance, Putin did. Us benefiting from a circumstance we didn’t create isn’t a bad thing.
Finally its not as if the war is creating all smiles on our end. We are still subject to the same inflation that this war is causing. Europes just pissed because the war isn’t hitting us as hard as it is them. Yes that’s sucks but also not at all our fault.
