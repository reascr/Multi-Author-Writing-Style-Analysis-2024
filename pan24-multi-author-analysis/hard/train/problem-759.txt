Russia would then be on the verge of a nuclear civil war or civilized break up. In any case, war criminals would be dealt with. And a lesson to wannabe Hitlers of the future.
These fascists are just clowns playing their roles. What is sadder is the Russian audience who believes this circus to be reality,approves and applauds it. Because if the Russian public didn't approve this sort of circus there would be no audience and hence this sort of propaganda would be ineffectiveness.
We have info that many mobiks have been getting sick, deserted, drunk. Their training is subpar, and equipment still lacking. Whatever their push will be it will happen at the height of winter. It's not beyond Putin for such an idiotic offensive, but it will backfire terribly, again.
Putin's current official replacements are as bad or worse than him. They are all people made from the same cloth. All are ultranationalistic, all dream of their past glory as the USSR, all want it back. Even Navalny argued that while Crimea was taken in violation of international law, it is now a part of Russia and will still stay part of Russia. For a total regime change to happen, it needs to occur via internal revolution in favor of a western-friendly leader or NATO would have to come in and occupy Russia, both very unlikely scenarios. The Russian regime will still be hostile even after it was thrown out of Ukraine.
Well they continued, and Russia just attaked Kyiv again Time to send the fucking long range weapons and fuck Russia up.
It’s funny to think about Russia going “Oh, you promised to send EVEN MORE modern and devastating equipment if we do the thing? Well now we’ll do the thing As soon as possible”.
