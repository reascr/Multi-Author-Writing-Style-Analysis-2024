For sure. Had Biden ordered it shot down over land theyâ€™d just switch and be outraged at the risk he took with American lives and any destruction of property.
If he had shot it down immediately they would be complaining that Biden risked American lives and infrastructure. "What damage would it have done to the power grid if it had landed on power lines?" and all that.
Yeah. Sorry. I mean his voting base has this weird idea about this man who was going to set things right, which unsurprisingly never manifested it's self. It was this weird cognitive dissonance where the anti government crowd continued hating the government even after the dude they elected wom and he hated the government too. So the narrative about liberal elites controlling everything just continued. Trump was the best president ever even though he's some how not in charge at all...
Everyone was so excited have a powerful politician in charge. And then when nothing got better that powerful politician and his electorate blamed an unelecyshadow government... It's nuts...
