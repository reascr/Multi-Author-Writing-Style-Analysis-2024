the people protested the lockdowns, and the government stupidly lifted the lockdowns. The people also protested the various vaccine mandates when they were attempted, so the government made it voluntary, even for the ones that really should be taking it. So, I doubt the vaccination rates would go up even if it's a western one.
it probably won't help. For the right price, they could pay for a negative test result. And even if the destination airport require a test on arrival, they potentially infected people on the flight over, who won't test positive until a few days later.
Test everyone as they disembark, one person comes off the plane and tests positive, everyone on the plane wins a few weeks of quarantine. We can also literally do covid tests as people board the plane rather than rely on falsifiable documents, and sure, they're not 100% but better than "bro, trust me bro".
If you have a hundred people packed into a metal tube for eight to ten house with one or more people with a highly communicable airborne virus, treating them all as infected for a while until they can be confirmed to be free of the virus is just common sense.
Also, China likely gets shit on a little more heavily for their actions because China is both the source of the world's Covid woes and has repeatedly acted irresponsibly and with no concern for the impact their actions had on the rest of the world so there's not a lot of good will left for China (and that's not even considering their other human rights violations like Xingjian, the Yugurs, and China's increasingly aggressive posture in the western Pacific).
And it's true, I often do things the hard way simply to remind myself that a little inconvenience and trouble won't kill me.
