1. Most reps and government officials are not well known outside their (small) constituency, even then probably not well.
The next time you see a politician talking shit or engaging in what you believe is self destructive rhetoric that will kill their careerâ€”they are aiming for a gig like this (and/or a book tour, also lucrative and no work involved). It pays so much better than their regular job, and there will almost ALWAYS be a gig like this waiting for anyone with national attention. Liz Cheney tanking her career? No fucking way, a book is DEFINITELY going to come soon, she's also due since she had books in 2011 and 2015. And it will sell like hotcakes in airports to bored liberals looking for catharsis. MTG talking the worst possible shit? Conservative media is saving a seat for her. Kyrsten Sinema fucking over the people who elected? Doesn't care, better paying gigs are coming now that she is a nationally known figure.
2. To go national means high chances of gigs like this, which pay a lot better than whatever you government position pays (and there is a lot less work involved!).
That's the thing. She ran as a Democrat. Now Fox News et al can drag her around as their token, claim she's the correct Democrat, and anyone left of her is a communist who wants to rape your children. It's a con as old as time.
