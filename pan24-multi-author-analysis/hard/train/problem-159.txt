Yikes, is this how it's always been here on this sub when Israel is mentioned? I doubt any of these users are Palestinian or Israeli and yet they act like it's happening to them.
To start, you don't understand the first part of the report- it's talking about inter-Arab killing among Arab citizens of Israel. Those 110 dead are Palestinians killing other Palestinians. You can blame Israel for poorly enforcing gun control (and control in general) in its Arab-majority cities, but that's about it. This entire part is all about criminal justice, not the national conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and it's suspect that Amnesty chose to include it at all.
Amnesty are in no way, shape or form non-aligned in this conflict. They're explicitly pro-Palestinian.
No, it's not. This is part of a larger wave of attacks going on for a while now, and none of the attackers or the organizations sending them even mentioned the journalist. Just your usual "defend Al Aqsa from the Jews" and "From the river to the sea" business.
