The missile can blast targets at a terrifying 16,000mph and has a range of over 11,000 miles, reports The Sun, making it 1,000 times more powerful than the bombs dropped by the US on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan during the Second World War.
I swear it’s using the range of 11,000 miles and comparing it to the range of the bombs (when exploded) in Japan. Atleast that’s what the sentence makes it out to be.
Seems to be the case. They’d rather give downvotes to try and get that hidden instead of posting a genuine response. Putin can go choke on a bear cock for all I care but I think a lot of these people are too ashamed to admit they didn’t care until the Twitter and Reddit told them to care.
Actually I’m willing to bet they didn’t even know that the Russo-Georgian war ever happened. And I’m sure a small percentage saw “Georgia” and thought of Georgia the state and didn’t even know the country existed.
Genuinely curious but where was this level of outrage when Georgia, Crimea, Chechnya etc… we’re all invaded? Hell part of Georgia is still currently occupied and has been since like 2008. Why did no one scream “Fuck Russia” then?
