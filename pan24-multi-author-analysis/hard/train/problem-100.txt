In the past 2 months, Fidesz has built a narrative about the EU sanctions against Russia being the cause of the Hungarian economy tanking and the value of the Hungarian Forint taking a nosedive.
This narrative paints Orbán and his party as "freedom fighters" trying to keep a deranged Brussels in check, shifting all blame solely on the EU.
A (it's in Hungarian, not sure if there is an English version) revealed that a third of all voters (and half of Orbán's voters) were convinced that Orbán voted against the sanctions.
This is possible due to a small detail about the sanctions being kept obscure in the media: Any one head of a member state not signing a sanction is enough to stop it from coming into effect. In other words, Orbán signed everything that he claims is hurting his country.
All of Orbán's ideological friends abroad are in trouble. Trump is under legal investigation, Bolosanaro is out, Russia is desperately grappling to keep a losing war going longer in the desperate fantasy that Western unity will fall apart with the cold and so on.
