After spine surgery, when I was in the hospital the doctors had me on multiple painkillers and muscle relaxers to manage ongoing pain and discomfort. I just smoke a joint and it replaces like three pills. Cannabis isnâ€™t for everyone but holy shit is it helpful for some.
Cannabis is kinder, mellows me out, not couch potato, but lessens anxiety, thus taking edge off pain.
I have reduced so much inflammation thanks to cannabis. All inflammation was caused from diet and alcohol abuse from bad education on diet. Nice to finally have a good medication and I don't have to hide from helicopters anymore to get it.
A good outdoor sativa does fine and allows for energy and creativity through the day. I prefer outdoor grown Thai. Outdoor grown is very important, indoor grown is weaker.
Well I am glade you can get by with your setup by all means I have been their. I live in California for a reason and I fought like shit dodging cops just to get it from outdoors here over what I was doing indoor. I stopped buying it the minute i could get my outdoor plants harvested. You will have to support outdoors California growers for this very reason. It grows best here in California. edit: spelling.
