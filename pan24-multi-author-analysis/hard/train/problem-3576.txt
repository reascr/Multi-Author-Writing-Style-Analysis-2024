you are falling for a gambit that the oil and gas companies want you to fall for. they want you to think that the switch can only come at a terrible price in human life.
yup, we'd need an alternative source. crazy that the oil and gas companies spend literally billions of dollars a year suppressing research. insane. let's keep falling for their gambit.
i never said that things would change on a dime. but let's not pretend that "killing a sizeable percentage of the world's population" is a natural consequence of this. that is a talking point from the oil and gas companies.
We've been relying on self-reporting by the oil and gas industries. All of our projections for what measures we need to take to fight climate change, and how strong our response needs to be, come in no small part from that self reporting.
Experts and analysts have been saying for quite a while, that we're reaching a point of no return, based on those reports.
Well, now we find those reports are false. Meaning the time frame for "we're fucked as a species" is nowhere near as wide as we thought. Which probably indicates that we've already passed that threshold, we just haven't figured it out, yet.
