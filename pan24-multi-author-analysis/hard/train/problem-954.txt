Cant believe that after all the fuckups with the polls, there are still people falling for it. Even worse, people are still underestimating Biden. At this point, people are just willfully asking to be fooled. Biden has proven to be one of the best and most capable president we've had in awhile.
No one has the experience or knows the game better than Biden. The fact that he’s always underestimated has been a strenh.
I only think a moderate Democrat would have done as well, as these midterms showed voters are tired of gridlock and extremes (I mean, the House was won through R victories in places like NY and CA). Are we going to pretend like Biden didn’t fight for major bipartisan deals and win? Dude ran a masterclass on pushing through legislation, and I don’t think a less-experienced or more progressive Democrat would have been as successful and able to prove to the voters that they can get things done in this politically-divisive climate.
Do you think the democrats would have been even close if the primaries hadn’t produced such an historical class of clowns for the republicans, because of trumps influence? Not to mention if roe hadn’t been overturned, or that there was a bunch of people who were openly and preemptively claiming the election was stolen if they didn’t win?
You could put most any democrat in the presidents seat for these life terms with these circumstances, and I think you’d at least get these same results, likely better.
