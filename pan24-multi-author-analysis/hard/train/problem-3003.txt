The problem is trump though. That 20% have shown that they will show up to vote against trump. Also the kids that will be able to vote by 24 are anti trump voters too for the most part.
Democrats are younger, and more become voters every year, while Republicans are older, and less of them vote every year.
Trump will beat DeSantis? Cool story, but he still has to beat Biden, and he's in an even worse position than he was in 2020.
On the flip side, Biden has more weaknesses than he did in 2020. He's older, the economy is in rough shape (this might change by 2024 but who knows) and he has many other policy decisions to defend now. Not to mention the chaos of the Ukraine war could go either way when it comes to American sentiment.
No they aren't. The outcomes of the last few elections have been well within 538's predictions which use these polls.
There were a few upsets in the House for races they thought were safe like Washinon's 3rd but that's hardly enough to say "polls are meaningless.".
This is it. Trump being on the ticket is going to do more for Biden than anything else. And I'm here for it. Could even help democrats retain the Senate.
