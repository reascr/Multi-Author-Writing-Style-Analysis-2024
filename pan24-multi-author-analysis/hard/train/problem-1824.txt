Can’t you see that when Hamas puts their weapons adjacent to children, THEY are the ones putting their children in harms way?? How do you not understand this?
You said israel targets children with missiles (Gaza) so I asked you what should israel do to stop Hamas’s rocket fire (Gaza) and you send over an essay about the West Bank.
no matter what you think about IDF, i think anyone can agree that putting rocket launchers near a school shows a horrifying disregard for lives of children.
That aside, I think any rational human can agree that placing rockets IN AND AROUND SCHOOLS is morally reprehensible and suggests that they value killing israeli's more than they do protecting their own children.
always shocking to me that people, no matter where they stand politically, will willfully ignore the fact that military units will place rocket launchers IN AND AROUND schools. Surely your hatred for the IDF can't blind you to the fact that what Hamas is doing is morally reprehensible and even doubly shocking given that they're putting their own children at risk.
Don't you see, Hamas is improving the children's souls by making them martyrs while the Israelis are evil for not letting Hamas kill their kids. Israelis should martyr their kids too in order to be as morally righteous as Hamas. /s.
