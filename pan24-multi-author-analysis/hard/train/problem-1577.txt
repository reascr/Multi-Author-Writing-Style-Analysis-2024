He didn't run for reelection because he knew he wasn't going to win the primary, because the Mass GOP hated him for calling out Trump. So the parent comment is correct. You are also correct though because if the Mass GOP had picked a reasonable candidate (like Baker) then they might not have lost. Or if they had just stuck with Baker and not ostracized him for calling out Trump they probably would still have the governorship.
Fuck off, republican governor of Massachusetts Charlie Baker called trump out for his bullshit in 2018 and after January 6th. He got ostracized from the GOP for this, and the Republicans lost the governorship in one of the BLUEST states in 2022 because of it.
Like in Washinon the GOP representative who called out Trump, lost the primary to Joe K., who in turn lost a red region in and by two of the bluest states to a Dem.
Maybe if these unaware leaders who birthed, fed, and raised the beast would just have done more a long time ago, the normal Republicans would have stood a chance and wouldn't be completely synonymous with MAGA.
