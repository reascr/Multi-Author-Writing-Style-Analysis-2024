The Pentagon apparently wasn’t aware of the balloons until after Trump was out of office. Would corroborate Trump’s team’s claim that he wasn’t told about them while in office.
Esper said he didn’t receive any info on that, Bolton said there was no briefing about it. That’s all the security/defense guys I’ve seen deny it. I don’t like Bolton, but I trust him on that. He’s a national security guy who split with Trump, he’s not gonna hold something like that back at this point.
I’m not arguing about the optics here. I know the politics of it all, the Dems are already trying to play it as a failure of Trump in the media when it was a failure of military intelligence, which isn’t automatically/necessarily a fault of Trump. Could he have played a role in it somehow? Maybe. But it’s only been a few days. It’s going to take time to investigate.
I mean by all means investigate. Any answer they find looks absolutely terrible for them outside of liberal plot, and that's the least plausible by a mile.
If anything it's a great play to advertise Biden's security record. Spy balloon shows up, we track it, down it when safe to do so.
I know they've been going after the military lately but this turn to anti-law/anti-military/anti-government is wild for an ideology flip. Especially considering that's their base generally.
