Good genetics really helps. I have cheap Amazon led lights, five gallon buckets, a 20 dollar tiny desk heater. I check the tent each day, water about every third day. Harvest 3-4 ounces about every 90 days. Way more than I can use. The seeds are twenty bucks each though.
Yah, you can get 300 dollar weed, but come on. This isnt like my first time in a bar where someone is going to convince me its worth it to buy pricey booze. I have had 500 dollar ozzers and I have had 40 dollar ozzers. There's a reason i still buy 40 dollar over 200,300,400+ dollar ones.
i've been given 5% by accident before that was mislabeled. It might has well have been smoking hemp paper. Like you said, there is a bit more to it yes, but its like thinking you are gonna get more hammered in a better way if you pay 40 dollars a shot vs 4 at the bar. One may taste better and go down smoother, but even after that first one, theres no real difference.
The other numbers you are hitting there are interesting just in relation regardless of volume. I can plainly see those numbers equaling bankruptcy and job loss.
