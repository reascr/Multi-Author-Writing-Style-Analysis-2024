Like dude what the fuck, you’re just making things up to get mad at. I started to check fox to see if that was even a talking point and I don’t think it was that week.
Happened to me on thanksgiving…it was a day free of Fox News and I was so happy. I had said “isn’t it weird how Black Friday isn’t really a big deal anymore?” And my father fucking lost it “YEAH BECAUSE THESE WOKE IDIOTS RUINED EVERYTHING AND NOW YOU CANT EVEN SAY BLACK ANYMORE!”.
Oh holy shit, I remember my dad talking to a friend of his about how they're surprised that the liberals haven't tried to change Black Friday into African-American Friday and it's like what kind of brain rot is that.
I follow Fox News a little bit to see what they are saying, and the week of Thanksgiving Jesse Watters basically opened up his segment saying liberals ruined Black Friday. I don’t remember what his bs reasonings were, but he was complaining about how it’s not “the good old days” anymore. And so your dad may have seen that show at least.
