You advocate for imprisonment for people unwilling to comply with a violation of their constitutional rights?
though I disagree with your comment I would never advocate for you to be imprisoned because you exercising your first amendment right is something that i do not agree with.
I'm in no way trying to start argument that will get us nowhere, im just trying to understand anti-gunners perspective more.
Well you understand that from the perspective of many, supporting an AWB would in fact make you “anti-gun”. The term isn’t exactly a precisely defined one so it comes down to the perspective of the person using it, so surely you can see that while you may not consider yourself anti gun, they might considering you’re advocating gun control policy.
edit: A question that's more interesting to me would be why do some gun owners expect anyone that disagrees with them on any given aspect of gun politics to be an 'anti-gunner'?
Personally I don't see how they wouldn't fit the "common use" test from Heller given that AR platform rifles have been the best selling type of rifle for years now.
