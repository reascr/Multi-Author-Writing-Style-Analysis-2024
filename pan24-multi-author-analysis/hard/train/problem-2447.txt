"Is it really the shooter's fault here - we don't do enough to discuss mental health and clearly the shooter was ill.".
Edit Before I get a snarky "but guns don't make you safer your own gun is more likely to kill you." That's because gun suicides outnumber gun homicides. People aren't killing themselves because of guns, they're just using one of the most effective means of suicide around them.
I'd say about 40% of my LGBT friend (including me) are firearm owners and most own AR-10/15 platform rifles and we don't really want our guns taken away especially in the rising homophobic tide that is the American right.
I am still in disbelief that a good chunk of the LGBTQ community is still anti 2A after all the hardships they have gone through, especially after the pulse shooting.
maybe i’m just gay and angry, but it’s a little disturbing to me that ANYONE is putting full blame on the access to firearms instead of the disease that is ignorance and hatred. don’t get me wrong, this is also a gun control issue, but he’s playing it as JUST gun control instead of an amalgamation of pitiful gun control, lack of education, and tolerance for hatred; which it is. he’s tip-toeing around calling for better lgbt+ education because god forbid we teach kids that other kids exist.
