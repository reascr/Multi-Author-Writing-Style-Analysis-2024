According to your logic AOC, Don Lemon, Adam Schiff, Eric Swalwell, Nancy Pelosi, Jim Kenney (mayor of Philly), Gretchen Whitmer (governor of MI), Phil Murphy (governor of NJ), Ned Lamont (governor of CT) are insane because they have all visited FL within the last year or two.
I don't like Ron and I too think him and the GOP of FL are nutcases but why resort to lying on him? rather we like it or not him touting FL as a freedom state during a time almost every state was on lockdown worked and it worked because people who grew tired of being on lockdown took the bait. I hope you aware that the average person doesn't consider politics when planning a vacation.
No he didn't. Foreign tourism decreased in 2020 and 2021 because of the travel ban while domestic tourism increased. my source but I'm sure your source is "trust be bro," "everyone I know refuse to visit FL.".
Ah yea. I read some articles, and speak to a few friends with experience there, and assume I'm up to speed on what's going on. It's obviously a complex and variable situation. Sorry to hear about the service. In my day, you didn't have a prayer of getting in, as no one left until retirement. Keep your head up, I'm proud of you and yours.
Don't have an answer myself, and all my sympathy to one who is actually entangled in this mess on the front line. You and yours have my utmost respect for staying on mission over many years. I am somewhat aware of the facts of the problem, and was more trying to make a point regarding the article than downplay the problem. In your opinion has it worsened to a degree requiring this callout, or is this simply posturing? I'm sure you guys have plenty of other things to do as well.
