for an old candidate who isn’t offering representation to them, the candidate will learn they can get free votes in exchange for nothing.
If you insist on not voting for either candidate, then your best bet is to still show up at the polls and just don’t vote for them. There are lots of positions on the average ballot and if you feel that strongly that you don’t care who wins, don’t chose either candidate, but there may be candidates who do interest you, and even if you turn in an empty ballot, that still signals that there was a vote that turned up that was missed.
Ah yes, not bothering to vote regularly is definitely a way to show an elected official that they should cater to you on the off chance you vote that election.
If young people show up regularly, as a real voting block, then their interests will suddenly matter to politicians.
When they don’t vote, then the issues of people who DO regularly show up (usually older people) matter instead.
Imagine if this were slow-walked because it primarily impacts older, Republican voters. Endangering them financially and via medical noncompliance due to cost; in a grim calculus of death and poverty. That would be disgusting and I’m glad it’s just an “imagine if”.
