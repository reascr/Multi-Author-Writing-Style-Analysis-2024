Not to sound like defending a theocratic regime but isn't that essentially center mass so any police getting the idea to shoot protestors would end up hitting anything from head to groin area most often?
And I don't think it's reasonable to compare a one-off death at an American protest to the hundreds intentionally murdered by the Iranian police during these protests.
The difference is they were shooting rubber bullets and the Iranians are being shot at with lead birdshot from shotguns.
Most provinces are bird shot bullets, rubber bullets and paint ball with occasional live rounds. Some provinces there's high use of live rounds such as sistan and baluchestan and Kurdish regions cause the regime is racist towards them compared to Persians.
