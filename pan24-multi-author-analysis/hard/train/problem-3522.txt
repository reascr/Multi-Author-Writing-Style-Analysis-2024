Both the American and Russian religious right allocate to Satanism the things they dislike, and often they dislike the same things, but Russians word it differently because they have to. The US has great social and political freedom, so Satanism is an excess of freedom. Even expanding civil rights is seen as some slippery slope to anarchy. Russia has few social and political freedoms, so Satanism is an attack on Russian freedoms. It's stupid, but that's how it works. Satanism is an attack on convention, whatever your conventions happen to be.
In the US you have two "Satanic" organizations - The Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan (i.e. LaVeyan Satanists).
There is an organization that calls itself the Satanic Temple. They do stuff like file lawsuits claiming that abortion is a sacrament in their religion and abortion bans infringe on their religious freedom, and start After School Satan clubs as a counterpoint to after school religious clubs in public schools. Basically they take the “religious freedom” laws that some evangelicals want to push, and turn it back on them. They’re all right.
They should be. I’m going to bust out my strongest crystals and send death vibes at Putin this weekend. Everyone else should do the same. Let’s see if we can wish him dead.
