It was Orban who pushed the self destruct button. He was warned another times but another president who doesn’t listen to reason. And doesn’t follow the rules of democracy only his rule.
Why isn't that democratic. We get most of the benefit and it's not like they're punishing us. Besides the western countries do this too, Austria blocked Romania and Bulgaria into shengen.
Recently Austria vetoed Romania and Bulgaria ascension to Schengen, in the past a Nordic country was blocking support to South Europe, Germany took decisions by itself that affected the entire union etc.
Poland and Hungary didn't start behaving like this just like that and pretty soon they might be joined by other countries, destroying the European dream we have.
Poland and Hungary are engaged in a dispute with the EU more generally, and are being difficult within the EU's mechanisms as part of that. It's not about Ukraine at all, really.
For the European Union as an organisation to give Ukraine aid, all EU member states must agree. Hungary does not, so it cannot happen.
