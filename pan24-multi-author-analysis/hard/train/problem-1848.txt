It seems to be less 'under review' and more like 'under confusion' resulting from uncosted half baked policies.
Especially since market forces seem to indicate that Solar and wind are better options as indicated by renewables drawing the majority of private investment in the Energy sector.
Solar is the way to go, solar panels and batteries for every house and business will make the uk independent for energy and possibly generate enough to export. That with wind and other power generating initiatives are the only way forward. Nuclear is a dirty and expensive way to generate electricity though it is a stable supplier when up and running.
Nuclear is expensive yes but much more efficient and scalable and plenty has been done to deal with the waste.
And the government will have to spend billions cleaning up the mess of nuclear waste again like they have been forced to do in so many cases.
I live 50 miles away from Sellafield and remember the blackout on what was done with the nuclear waste when it was suggested to bury it near Lodon and there was an outcry about how dangerous the waste was.
It only hit's home at how severely polluting nuclear is when it affects you, otherwise just dig a hole in the countryside and fill it and cover it with concrete 500 years later it will be reasonably safe.
