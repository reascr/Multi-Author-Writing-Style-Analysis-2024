The current Russian state is functionally a result of the KGB replacing the CPSU as the ruling power in the country. The CPSU was ideological - even its most cynical politicians broadly accepted the ideological underpinnings of the state - whereas the Siloviki feel no obligations to do any such thing.
To call it conservative implies it has a deeper ideology than it has actually got and to some extent accepts the image it tries to portray to the Americans. It's governed by more of a sort of obsequious national nihilism.
Their whole country seems like it’s based on cynicism and shallow moral grandstanding. They claim to have a moral high ground over the “decadent” West, but they have rampant alcoholism, physical abuse, and intolerance towards anyone different. Everything is made to benefit to top echelons of their society, and corruption and lies reign over the country. Russia is a country that has turned into some sort of nightmare, and it’s shocking to see so many people eagerly buying into their ideology abroad. It’s a festering wound slowly poisoning everything around it, and it’s a horrible shame. That being said, you’re right that they brought this upon themselves; Putin and his regime have been supported by Russians all too willing to believe the comfortable lies.
