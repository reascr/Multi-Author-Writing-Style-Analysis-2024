A declaration from Allah and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage1 that Allah and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from Allah. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful punishment.
..In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said, (I have been commanded to fight the people until they testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establish the prayer and pay the Zakah.) This honorable Ayah (9:5) was called the Ayah of the Sword, about which Ad-Dahhak bin Muzahim said, "It abrogated every agreement of peace between the Prophet and any idolator, every treaty, and every term." Al-Awfi said that Ibn Abbas commented: "No idolator had any more treaty or promise of safety ever since Surah Bara'ah was revealed. The four months, in addition to, all peace treaties conducted before Bara'ah was revealed and announced had ended by the tenth of the month of Rabi Al-Akhir.".
That’s not the point. What do you expect fifa to do other than ban Iranian participation? Nobody is arguing here that it’s right for the Iranian government to treat the people this way. But a sports organization can’t do much about it. Don’t be dense.
No they put the shah in power. Leading to a period of westernization and freedom. Then the ayatollah came back in 1979. And I think it is pretty difficult to argue that the ayatollah has done anything positive for Iran since.
They’re a sports organization. What do you expect them to do? Invade Iran? Not defending FIFA, because they’re a shitty, corrupt organization. But that is what they could and should feasibly be able to do.
