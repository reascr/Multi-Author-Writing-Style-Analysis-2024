Saturation attacks are highly effective against even the most advanced missile defense systems. As long as the target isn't concealed or mobile it's definitively vulnerable.
That said, you probably want a saturation attack to include more than 50 missiles to have a good chance at hitting multiple valuable targets.
Military equipment being used in a war is always a legitimate target. It’s a damn weird war when you aren’t allowed to shoot at the enemy’s weapons.
I honestly can’t figure out who the announcement was for. Do they think the Americans expect the Russians to just not try to blow up the stuff we gave Ukraine?
I don't think anyone in any country supplying weapons to Ukraine expected anything different? It is a bit odd, almost like showing their hand how nervous Kremlin is about provoking a NATO response.
Russia has made these particular weird statements before. Saying weapons supplied by the west would be targeted once in country in Ukraine.
This is why I hope there is some to complement/protect any Patriot missile system that is deployed in Ukraine.
iranian drones, especially when you consider the cost of that system. Using a multi-million dollar missile to deal with a drone that costs a few hundred/thousands would be wasteful, to say the least.
