Republicans have not won a first term presidency by popular vote since 1988, and have held the office of president via the electoral college twice in that time.. + the other things they said.
The most glaring bundle of evidence of why we are where we are today is that Republicans haven't won the popular vote to win the presidency since 1988 - 34 years ago... yet they've won twice since then by electoral college, and have a Supreme Court supermajority of 6-3, where 5 of those 6 were appointed by presidents who did NOT win the popular vote, one of which is a stolen seat. A bonus is that the U.S. Senate - which molds the judiciary, SC, and the cabinet and nearly all major policy - has a Republican stronghold that represents roughly 40M less people than the Democrats in the Senate do.
The ball's in Democrats court, since there's a Republican introduced-bill currently waiting in the House if the Democrats ever want to bring it up for a vote/pass (since, you know, they hold the majority atm).
That would be like me giving you a heads up that I'm about to knock your teeth in, and saying "See, I'm the good guy since I gave you a heads up".
No offense, but unless Kavanaugh, or his immediate family, outright said it, I doubt the whole "he's on the fence" narrative.
