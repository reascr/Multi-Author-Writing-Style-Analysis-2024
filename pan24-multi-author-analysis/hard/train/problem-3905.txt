Yeah so if Russia wants to block new NATO countries they just need to have someone burn a book in thier borders and know that the country won't murder them for it it will make Turkey mad ðŸ¦ƒ?
Even if Sweden is blocked by Turkey, NATO would never allow Russia to control Gotland, it would be a huge threat to all the NATO counties that border the baltic.
Even with Finland in NATO without Sweden, Sweden would still be a target, even if its more of a challenge for the enemy to invade Sweden since Finland would be NATO territory. Sweden could still be attacked with missiles from Kaliningrad or from submarines and ships in the Baltic Sea, even if its unlikely.
Sweden: East side of the country is wide open to the Baltic Sea, and Russia can go with submarines or ships all over the place.
No thanks. Erdogan can f\ck off though and stop using his propaganda bs for the upcoming election. Sweden and Finland will stick together in this NATO application. If one of us cant join none of us will. And that will upset USA and the others because they all want us in NATO.
Considering the countries in NATO have to 100% go to war each other, it's not unreasonable. I think a better angle should be to kick turkey out. What do they even bring to the table?
