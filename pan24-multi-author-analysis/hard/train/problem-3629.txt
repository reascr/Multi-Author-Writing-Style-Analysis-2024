a nuke won't help putin achieve anything tangible though and it would be a hellstorm for russia if they launched a nuke. You think a country that cant defend its strategic military bases within arms reach of its capitol can afford to play the nuclear stand off game? russia is a sitting duck and launching nukes would be the end of russia let alone this war.
How has russia been irrational? They are doing what they know how to do, and putin is not suicidal, he is willing to slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own people, but he isn't willing to destroy his regime, hence why he is still fighting this war.
Ukraine is hitting military targets on military bases. My point is that russia doesn't have the air defense depth to protect itself from soviet era loitering missiles, they aren't going to be able to stop the NATO/American campaign to destroy their nuclear launch capability if they do decide to nuke someplace.
You said "they aren't going to be able to stop the NATO/American campaign to destroy their nuclear launch capability". Single drone/missile strike will never destroy entire Russian nuclear arsenal or even most of it. Bombers are only 1/3 of their nuclear arsenal, and nuclear silos are pretty resistant.
Mass missile launch (and anything less would not destroy all nuclear silos) is impossible to miss. Nukes would be launched well before missiles reach their targets.
