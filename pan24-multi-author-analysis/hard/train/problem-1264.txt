The risk with the flu vaccine is that they use eggs in the making of. There's a protein that exists in the gut of a chicken that uncooked can trigger GBS in those with a genetic predisposition at an incredibly high rate.
Since GBS I've had everything else, measles boosters, tetanus shots, chicken pox, a huge list because I worked in a hospital. The only one I missed was the flu.
The last time that I got the flu was probably 19 years ago. I believe diet and exercise work are much better at warding off the flu than a flu shot. However this is perfect for people with a weak immune system.
Your average immune system is going to get pummeled. So what a vaccine does is get a Mike Tyson look alike to recreate all the move sets in sparring matches, and does a rocky montage with your immune system.
This way when it comes to getting the virus, your immune system is much better prepared, it doesn't mean you'll not get the virus - that is down to exposure, and exposure alone. But instead your immune system would have a much better chance of fighting it off.
From my understanding, it's like your immune system is getting ready for a boxing match. Could be anyone you're fighting, and occasionally it's prime Mike Tyson.
