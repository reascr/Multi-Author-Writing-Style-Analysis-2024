It has zero to do with voter ID laws. . Yet to meet a single person who doesn't have some form of ID that would work at the voting booth. You also have 2 weeks to vote, including two weekends.
Our polls are open for two weeks and by law must include two weekends. There is zero excuse to not vote.
Florida is one of 11 states that STILL refuse to expand Medicaid for the working poor. But good thing those people vote for Republicans to 'own the libs'.
I never voted for Republicans when I lived there. Unfortunately, the bigger issue I saw in Florida was many low income people were so preoccupied with the difficulty of life that they simply do not vote. Those voter ID laws partly seem to cultivate a culture of not voting amongst the poor. A lot of the people who are old and retired which makes up a huge chunk of their population are the ones voting for these assholes. I mean I imagine there are some poor people voting against their interest there as in every state but frankly the ones I met simply didn't vote at all.
