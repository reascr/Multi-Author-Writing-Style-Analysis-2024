The US government will not generally choose to help workers because it stands with and for businesses first, not because it is powerless to do so.
Why would any company support their workers if they know that (if they're essential enough) the government will just swoop in and crush it?
Because the government doesn’t have the power to order companies to give certain benefits? I don’t disagree that 0 sick days is a little ridiculous, but the rail strike needs to be avoided at all costs. It would absolutely guarantee a blowout in the 2024 election and Americans would struggle to live their day to day lives. Sorry but it’s not worth it as a whole.
Because again, that would harm the US economy and Democrats don’t want to look bad going into 2024. The majority of Americans don’t give a shit about unions really, they only care about living their day to day lives. In this case the majority of railway unions support the new deal, it’s only the minority holding out. The railway companies have agreed to a very noticeable pay increase of like 25%. If the majority of the unions agree, and the railway companies agree, I just don’t think it’s right to try to please everyone in this case.
Why don't they take the position of forcing the railway companies to comply with the demands of the Unions?
