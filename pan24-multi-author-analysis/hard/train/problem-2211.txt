This is is the kind of thing I try to explain when someone tells me they’re totally against GMO food. Yes, it can be used to make plants more resistant to herbicides so more can be used, but it can also be used like this to reduce or eliminate pesticides.
Natural/organic lawn care is still lawn care, and the organic pesticides used are often less safe, less environmentally friendly, and less effective.
Friendly reminder that pesticides don't just help farmers grow food more easily - they also help reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture by reducing spoilage. It's wasteful to grow crops and let them be needlessly destroyed by pests.
As your own article states, "the level and quality of evidence that supports glyphosate’s effects on the microbiome is weak".
Fact of the matter is, the amount of glyphosate being ingested by consumers is about a million times too low to have an antibiotic effect in the gut.
Let's look at a study which examined this in detail. Keep in mind that all of the relevant studies in the article you posted were speculation with no actual lab research.
