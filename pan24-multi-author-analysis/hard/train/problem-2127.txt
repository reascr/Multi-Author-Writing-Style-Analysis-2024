The game Raid Shadow Legends is made in Ukraine and they have had zero downtime associated with the war (though some feature delays as their employees relocated). If they can do it, I'm sure the banking sector can do it too.
I assume they mean taking out bank buildings and such. They cant take out the infrastructure no, but I assume they just want to make it a lot harder for Ukrainians to buy food and necessities by destroying cash reserves.
I know life aint fair and maybe this is just wishful thinking but I see no way Russia would ever agree to pay reparations. So Ukraine is fucked completely even if allies use the frozen russian assets to fund the rebuilding.
I think we should aim to stop the war as soon as possible on Ukraine terms, and seemingly the sanctions imposed on Russia is not enough.
Also what good is rearming Ukraine if we are just going to demand they surrender again next time Russia decides their border should be a few hundred miles west?
In that case, ukraine could offer the following things in exchange for a peace deal with Russia (note, it is of course ukraines decision what to offer, could and should are not the same word):
Thereâ€™s plenty of the above that ukraine could offer up, that would make peace a better outcome for the Russian government.
