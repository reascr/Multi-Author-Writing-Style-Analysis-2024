Just my two cents, but I think you’re wrong there. If you go back in the closet, how will they target you? Try to think of it from the perspective of a heartless, conniving shitbag. It’s not that the top shitbags super duper care about hurting you, it’s just that language about hurting you really energizes their base and any actual danger to you isn’t something that concerns them. Of course, if it wasn’t you, they’d be terrorizing someone else, because that’s where their power comes from. That’s why we all need to oppose this sort of rhetoric and the people who use it.
This rhetoric from the dumbasses being spread here is one of the reasons the debate has gotten to this point. You say something absurd like “if you don’t like LGBT then you clearly support the mass shooters” removes any credibility you had.
Let’s be clear: there are actual organizations calling for the deaths of LGBT, and it’s not a bunch of conservatives in the west.
They don’t advocate for hour genocide. They disagree with you way of life and are bigoted buffoons, but after years of dealing with conservatives and religious fanatics that VAST majority don’t want the destruction of LGBT.
I ain't advocating for anything specific here to be clear but this shit has been so one sided with the attacks on the LGBTQ community, it'd be better if the scales were a bit more balanced.
Edit: to be clear they are targeting all of the LGBTQ community, particularly the trans community right now, but they will work against anyone who isn't like them.
