They never ever ever think, "Huh, maybe we shouldn't be such detestable assholes. Maybe we shouldn't run brain-damaged know-nothings with a history of domestic abuse for high office. Maybe we should do more to help people and appeal to them.".
yeah. For a while after the civil war the Republicans were the party of Capitalists and abolitionists. But given the Capitalists slowly becoming the dominant force in the Republican party, the leftists got pushed into the Democratic party, and of course leftists and Racism don't really go together well it split the Democrats on social issues with the Racists not really giving a fuck about the economic issues. So when the capitalists realized that their party was rapidly losing steam they courted the Racist vote after the much larger socially liberal arm of the Democrat party decided that black people have rights.
When right after they passed a bunch of voter disenfranchisement policies and are now trying to figure out how to make themselves win (in the sneaky way).
Yes that's your opinion, but in their opinions, that is the exact opposite result of their goals through gerrymandering and infringing upon voting rights.
Saying this as someone with 2 boomers as parents, the problem only gets solved when Boomers "expire" at faster rates & in higher numbers than the time & effort it takes for them to indoctrinate younger people.
