This is the answer. Biden was a puppet and trump was really still running the country from his resort where he had access to all kinds of govt confidential info he needed to make decisions for Biden and team.
No, people told me that he is running the country from mar a lago. He is making critical decisions but letting Biden take credit. Are you saying this is not true.
Seems so. He has nothing to offer except grievance and whining. That’s all he did in office. I’ve never seen such a lazy, slob claim to be so wonderful. He accomplished nothing productive in office. Republicans in Congress were responsible for the GQP Tax Scam, not trump. He was good at cozying up to Putin and other authoritarian leaders but that was it.
I know. I was just highlighting the time trump had the bully pulpit from the beginning of his campaign through his time in office. After his coup failed it seemed less visible. He will continue to piss, moan and lie until the day he dies. He loathes being a loser which he has been his entire life.
