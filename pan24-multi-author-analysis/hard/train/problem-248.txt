I still can't believe that Russia is yet to achieve air superiority over Ukraine.. how a country can call itself a "superpower" with a straight face when it can't even win what should be a one sided air battle right at its own border is beyond me.
I don't think it's just Ukraine having better air defense, I think it's also Russia being much worse at intelligent gathering and having a comically low supply of smart and targeting munition which makes finding and successfully disabling air defense networks much harder and more costly.
Interesting article but it does a lot of handwaving that really underscore US dominance and asymmetric air warfare vs Russian air power than set Ukraine's air defense as markedly different than the Iraqi interested air defense system.
Actually easy to understand: Soviets focused on anti-air defence over airpower, and Ukraine inherited the same air defences.
Then, Ukrainians get HARM missles that hunt radars, and Russian equivalent missiles don't work all that well, and it's all a huge game of cat and mouse now.
So... Russia strikes hard with air, jams the Ukrainians till blind, but then has to shut down their jamming to not interfere with own operations.
Russia also has way more bodies to throw at this war, they will win an extended war of attrition. I see way too many jokes and overconfident remarks on here. The situation is pretty serious in Ukraine.
