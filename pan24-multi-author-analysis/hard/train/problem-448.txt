As opposed to getting Biden and Congress to force the unions to accept the shitty proposal they already rejected, which by no means disincentivizes "good faith negotiation" right bud? These railroad bosses are disgusting.
They're separate bills. It's very possible, likely really, that only the bill preventing the strike (and not granting any sick days) will clear the Senate.
It is possible that the Senate votes only to enact the contract, but not include the leave. If the leave is included then that is a win for the workers.
Edit to clarify, the tentative agreement has I think one day of leave, well short of what the unions were asking for.
The issue at the heart of this negotiation is paid sick leave. Congress passed two bills, one to force through the tentative agreement, and another to add a week of paid leave to that agreement.
Congress added 7 days of sick leave to the bill, which is 3 more days than the unions were asking for, and was the last sticking point in negotiations. They shouldn't have any reason to be upset now.
