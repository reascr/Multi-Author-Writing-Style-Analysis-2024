The House Ways and Means Committee has voted along party lines 24 to 16 to publicly release several years of former president Donald Trump's tax returns in a redacted form, bringing a years-long dispute to a close.
Dec 20, 2022: Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee votes to release Trump’s taxes to the public.
This will make public a report on Trump’s tax information AND his actual tax returns (!) per lawmaker on W&M. The latter will take longer due to needed redactions.
“And I think what I find surprising… is the irs did no audits at all until such time as the day they received Mr. Neal's request for these documents… I think you will see tens of millions of dollars in these returns that were claimed without adequate substantiation”.
Republicans in Congress could retaliate by releasing President Biden’s tax returns. Oh wait, he already released them like every president of either party besides Donald Trump for the last 40 plus years.
So Republicans voted along party lines against releasing something that Trumpclaimed he wanted to release 6 years ago. And now Republicans are screaming about how unfair it was to release them.
