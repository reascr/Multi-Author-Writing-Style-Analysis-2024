You know that concept pre-dates the USA by about 1500 years, right??? The Vikings invented trial by jury. They gave it to the Brits, who gave it to us.
GA has two types of Grand Jury. Special Grand Jury which this chick was the foreman for, and regular Grand Jury. Special GJs last longer, but don’t have indictment authority. Regular GJ which is going on now, only last for 2 months, and they have indictment powers. The next jury after the indictment isn’t really accounted for because it hasn’t been selected yet. That will follow after indictment, and arraignment.
um, except this kind of shit isn’t supposed to influence the Grand Jury, and why they are specifically instructed to not watch stuff about their case in the media and not take into account anything NOT presented in court.
It won’t affect the case against Trump & Co as the special grand jury doesn’t issue indictments, only recommendations which the DA has to then decide.
I’m sure as soon as she found out which case she would be sitting on, she got dollar signs in her eyes.
