Man I've tried some chocolate from the UK and Spain and it just tastes bad to me. Not that US chocolate tastes good, it tastes bad in a different way.
Their chocolate isn’t even good, and it melts into an oily mess in your fingers because of all the crap ingredients. Non-US chocolate has a higher melting point and better flavor to boot.
A higher melting point doesn't necessarily equate to a better, more flavorful chocolate. Quality of cocoa, cocoa butter, sugar and other ingredients are important. That is why you have Swiss Nestlé chocolate bars that cost under $2.00 vs. high end chocolatier's bars from Italy, France, etc. that cost big bucks.
Sickening. And because they are such a colossal, powerful business entity worldwide, I'm sure that makes it even more difficult to prosecute them, under international law which is already fraught with problems.
I can't eliminate them completely but have to a large degree for the last year shopping at big chain grocery stores. You can resist if you really want to.
Wanton, repeated and ongoing criminal acts committed with impunity and zero conscience surely represent some of the most evil people on the planet.
