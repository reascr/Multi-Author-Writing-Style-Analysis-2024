As if to say the US has no programs like the Chinese government has in terms of collating data on every citizen for the purposes of... Whatever purpose. I mean, is it paranoid to think we have such programs, or is it na√Øve to assume we don't? Basically anything else we have the capability of doing, we have the ability to do, above and beyond what other countries are capable of.
I don't understand. Are you saying that a country that has military footholds around the globe with the ability to project power towards the majority of countries on earth, owns nearly all of the largest data centers on earth, and has the most data infrastructure pipelines connecting them with the rest of the world, can't compete with China on surveillance because local governments can't or won't be bothered to fix potholes?
The strategies towards application of this amount of information are indeed different. That doesn't mean the US has no comparable systems to what the Chinese government has over their citizens.
Ya know, I agree that China isn't really a nation now that you say it. It's more an overarching oligarchic force holding together a bunch of others. A prison of nations, if you will.
