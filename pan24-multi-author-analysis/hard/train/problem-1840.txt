The Palestinian Authority promotes apartheid beliefs by making women second class citizens (same as Israelis making Palestinians Such) and willfully support the cleansing of homosexuals. This can be said of the majority of Muslim states - Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Yemen, Pakistan, etc.
Like the US. Blacks have been second class citizens from the moment they gained their freedom. It was codified until the 1960s, and has been de facto with banking and housing discrimination, mass incarceration, and as recently as this past election, direct disenfranchisement.
So yeah - call it what you will - but do so equally. You can't call out israel for being an apartheid state without all of the others.
Yes - israel is an apartheid state - in that many Palestinians have fewer rights than Israelis based on their ethnicity.
I am not saying that Palestinians don't have a right to live peacefully, but that isn't going to happen while they are under their own self-made terrorist rule. Hamas is a group of religious fanatics, they aren't interested in peace.
I don’t like Hamas but I’ve had this argument enough times and done enough research to know that Israelis started the conflict. I’m not just talking about forcibly taking land, I’m talking about terroristic attacks.
Since when is fighting back against an attacker and oppressor “terrorism”? There are plenty of incidents where Jewish people rightfully fought the Germans before and during WWII. Does that make the Jewish people terrorists or heroes? I say heroes.
