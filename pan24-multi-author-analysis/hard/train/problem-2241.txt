the news companies love to get people's blood boiling. See post 9/11 US. You're getting down votes because people are like 3 months away from realizing they're being rabbid mouth foaming idiots about balloons.
Shooting down 1000 dollar balloons with half a million dollar missiles could bankrupt the US in like a year if the US decided to continue this course. The reality is its just not cost effective to do this and that high up its unlikely the weight restrictions on balloons would make it more effective than satellites.
satellites balloons and planes are dependent on gravity. Without the earth's gravity the atmosphere would be pulled into the sun.
So yea the USA totally has a history of violating airspace with planes and balloons. Just because The USA is mostly good and the CCP is mostly evil doesn't mean you need to simp for America or not point out their hypocrisy.
How evil the CCP is makes The USA look like a naughty child that won't play fair by comparison. That being said.....
I'm not a physics professor but my understanding is that It's possible to orbit and be in airspace but being so low makes the orbit unstable.
