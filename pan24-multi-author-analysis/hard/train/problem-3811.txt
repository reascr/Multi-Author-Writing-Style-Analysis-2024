And their focus will be on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Hope that helps with inflation and housing issues!
Homeschool your kids and leave the rest of ours alone. You can have a say in your own kid’s education but when you force schools and school boards to bend to your will you’re taking away my rights as a parent for my kids’ school.
So when you force a school to do something it isn't getting in the way of my rights but if I do it is getting in the way of yours? That is the definition of hypocritical. Why not allow people to pick their schools? Why do people prevent that?
I think you should be able to pick any public school for starters. There shouldn't be boundaries. Furthermore, I think that you should be able to take the funds that would be spent on you in the public school and use it as a voucher to help pay for a private school. Since this original post involves Florida I think they are a pretty good state in this regards. So here is a look at the school choice options they have.
You are allowed to pick your schools. You can go to private ones, homeschool, join a homeschool pod with other families, or move to a different school district. You already have the options you say you want but you’re still supporting taking away options from others. I don’t try to force my kids’ school to change how they teach because I trust the education they’re getting there, I know their teachers, and I’m actually involved in my kids’ lives to know what they’re doing. .
P.S. But that uses the official numbers. Given DeSantis's response to whistleblowers, that may underreport things. I'd like to see excess mortality figures instead.
