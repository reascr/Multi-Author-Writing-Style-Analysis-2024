There is one bigger difference: no power sharing agreement. Having 51 Dem senators doesn't require McConnell and Schumer to come to a deal on how to run committees.
And even better with 51 votes senate committees will regain their subpoena powers which is crucial since the Democrats is on the verge of losing the House.
If the Republicans get the House, then the House is not going to pass bills Biden or the Democrats in the Senate want to see. So it doesnâ€™t even matter if we have 65 Democrats in the Senate when the Republicans are not going to pass anything in the House.
It would be amazing if the House Dems can convince a couple Republicans to vote with them on the speaker. Someone in the center, like Tim Ryan OH who lost his election. Or someone from the outside, constitution does not require the House leader to be an active member of Congress. Def not Pelosi, and forget pushing a progressive agenda (which I support).
It will never happen but reforming the 2 senators per state puts Dems at an epic structural disadvantage. Electoral college, gerrymandering add to it.
Manchin slowed and blocked a lot of legislation. He represents one of the most solidly Republican states and truth is that we are lucky that he caucuses with the Dems. If Manchin had switched to Republican we would be f and Mitch would rule. Even if he is difficult and not on the same page we just need to accept it.
