What's crazy is that is like the least objectionable behavior Republicans engage in. I don't give a fuck if you have an orgy or do coke, but can you stop being fascist thx.
I can't think of a less fun way to (try and) party than to do drugs with and see GOP dudes naked. Most of them look utterly disgusting with clothes on...I mean, if I saw Mitch or Lindsey or Dan Patrick naked I'd never want to have sex again.
They all look as if they got one shitty haircut at age 8 from the local, half-blind $7 barber and said, "Sheeiittt, I'm gonna stick with this right through to my deathbed!".
Ehh. That district really isnâ€™t gerrymandered. Buncombe county (Asheville) is like a 60% Democrat voting county in a sea of deep red counties in the NC mountains. Asheville is pretty liberal, but the county has a population of only a quarter million and was only the 12th most Biden voting county in NC out of the 25 that voted blue. That district in most maps will be somewhat of an uphill, but winnable, district for Democrats.
Edit: The 2022 maps were drawn by the NC Supreme court to eliminate the gerrymandered districts drawn in the maps presented by the Republican legislation. Seen you can see the western-most district in reference is not gerrymandered. It only slightly changed from the district Cawthorn won in 2020. I've seen alot of North Carolinians blame gerrymandering for everything, but it wasn't really the case in this past election. In fact, the district in question would have to be unfairly gerrymandered for Democrats for it to go blue.
