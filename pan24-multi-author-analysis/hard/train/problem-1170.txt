I once spoke to a guy who had been a department head for one of Murdoch's papers here in the UK. On the launch day all department heads were called into Murdoch's office and he told them "Gentlemen, I am here to sell papers. Now get out there and sell papers.".
Right. They just want to get a judgement which affirms the security of their systems, and which would discourage media outlets from slandering them in the future. Once they get that, they'll likely settle for a greatly reduced amount.
So there won't be any bankruptcy or spinoff necessary. A win for dominion would hurt the Murdochs in the pocketbook, but they'll still be billionaires when the dust clears. And Fox News will still be churning out misinformation, thought they might be a bit more careful when they attack large corporations in the future.
The only thing that would be a death blow for Fox News would be creating and enforcing standards and regulations on reporting. If they can’t spew propaganda and vitriol 24/7, the cult will change the channel and they will go under.
Oh dear, no I’m trying to get the extremist authoritarians out of power I find it interesting that some people think that advocating for standards and regulations that require truth in journalism is “extremist authoritarianism,” though. It must be so unbearably hard living life constantly being so oppressed by that extreme authoritarian, the truth.
