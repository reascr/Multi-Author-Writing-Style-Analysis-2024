She's neglecting to consider the fact that Naziism was predicated on the notion that the so-called Aryan Race was superior: the "master race".
This is definitely true, he spared any obvious aryan “races” in his extermination of the country and surrounding areas, that would seem that at least socially the Nazis viewed the Jews as a race.
Even if Jews aren't technically a separate "race," the Nazis considered us to be one and persecuted us as such. Yes, we tend to have an advantage in that we can "pass for white," but that doesn't lessen the oppression. It means needing to live every day of your life as someone else - likely under a different name. (A "Joseph Goldman" wouldn't be able to give his real name and not arouse suspicion of being Jewish.) Just ask any LGBTQ person in a repressive society how "free" they feel having to "play straight" and hide themselves every second of every day lest they be discovered and persecuted.
Whether or not Jews (such as myself) actually fit the definition of a race is immaterial in this instance. The Nazis treated us like we were a separate race and persecuted us for it.
That being said, white supremacists (and Nazis specifically) do consider Jews to be a separate race. This is important not because we should give their ideas any importance, but because it shows how they target Jews.
