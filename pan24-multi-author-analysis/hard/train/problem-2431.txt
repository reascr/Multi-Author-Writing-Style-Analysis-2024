It just blows my mind that Moldova hasn't tried to overhaul it's military. This is far from the first time there's been credible evidence Russia is interested in destabilizing Moldova.
Then they'll go conspiciously silent when Russia annexes Moldova, or just do their good old mental gymnastics.
Authoritarian leftist. People who think Stalin wasn't problematic and think it's a-ok for the state to work people to death. Named "tankies" because of the tanks the Red Army sent in to crush separatist demonstrations in the SSRs.
The OG tankies were british communists that cheered when russia sent in tanks to crush protests/uprisings in their occupied territories. Later on it changed into anyone who supports authoritarian states like modern russia, china or north korea.
Nowadays it pretty much applies to any westerners who cheerlead for violent authoritarian states like russia, china or north korea.
Well, the thing is that Russia is now far-right, hence that kind of sympathizers, and that should make a natural enemy of the likes of China, but they are united in their hatred of the US and the European Union.
