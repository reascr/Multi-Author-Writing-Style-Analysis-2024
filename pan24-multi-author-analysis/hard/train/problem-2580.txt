If they want to make everything a culture war then I say let them have Idaho. Fuck it. What do we miss out on, and don't say potatoes because those fuckers will grow anywhere!
Make it a bastion for conservative principles. Ban abortions, outlaw teaching science, tax the poorest people. Whatever. Get all the loony ones to move there and leave the rest of us in peace.
Basically, I'm saying lets make Idaho into a beautiful utopia for the flag people. The ones with 2 flags on the car, 3 in the front yard, and 4 more hanging up in the garage. Idaho is for those people now.
But people in Idaho voted for these guys. Like the majority. That’s how a democracy works. There are consequences for voting and this is one of them. If you want to fix this then it’s up to the people of Idaho to vote for better politicians.
The majority of Idaho voters voted for this crap, and you’re getting mad at someone for not saving Idahoans from Idahoans.
This will mean the fight is always over who can be more right, which will mean more of these reactionary bills that hurt regular Idahoans.
This will just further the divide as professionals and the highly educated will leave the state for blue states. The poor people who don't vote for this won't be able to afford to leave so they will just have to suffer. This will make the state more red, which will further emphasize the party primary as the key election.
This will just further red states having shorter life expectancies. Even before COVID red states died 2-3 years younger than blue states. That got worse with red states ignoring vaccines and even COVID treatments.
