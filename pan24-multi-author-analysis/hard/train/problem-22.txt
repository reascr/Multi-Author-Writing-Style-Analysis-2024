And China doesn't want to ask the outside world for vaccines because then they would have to admit that their sucks, and the government can't admit being wrong.
It's kinda surprising, China has go have a very deep pool of skilled scientists and resources, why they couldn't develop a vaccine as effective as the Wests.
Funny thing is, Russia is also Western country for them, so they wouldn't use their Sputnik either even though it's also about as effective and is better than Chinese vaccines.
If only China was smart enough to import some Western vaccines, they could have avoided all these deaths and controversy, but no, saving face is more important to them than saving lives. In the end, China didn't save face by pretending the Sinovac vaccine works when it really doesn't. China looks like it's run by a bunch of incompetent morons, tyrants and murderers. China's leaders refuse to listen to experts. This is why China will fall in the long term. Nations that ignore experts end up facing serious consequences.
