And this is the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas. These guys are supposed to be the legitimate peace partner that Israel works with to end the conflict.
Israel wants peace? Lol the Arabs and the Palestinians long ago said that lets make peace. Just give back the occupied West Bank and there will be peace.
Israelis want the kind of peace in which they are allowed to keep all the occupied land. That obviously doesn't work.
One could argue it in these terms. Expelling 80pc of Palestinians (nearly a million in number) and making them refugees comes with a genocidal intent.
Anyone who actually uses the word "genocide" to describe what Israel is doing, proves he has no idea about what's happening.
You do understand that if Israel actually wanted to wipe out Gaza, they could have done so in around 10 minutes, right?
Gaza has been blockaded for more than a decade now and you are saying that yeah we could've done more by wiping them out completely but haven't done it so be thankful to us. That is what you have said. Shameful. Gaza is blockaded by air and sea. Everyone knows that Israel has killed civilians intentionally there. They have shot unarmed protesters with live fire, killed medics and elderly.
