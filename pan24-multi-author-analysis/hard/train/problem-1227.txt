We probably couldn't even pay our retirees if we cut the budget by 90%, but definitely agree that we could make huge cuts and really make a difference in this country. I'd rather the process was slow and deliberate, but the chances of the Defense budget getting cut in the first place is 0 unless we vote in people wanting to do it.
I agree that we'd make easy work of Russia after seeing their ineptitude on display since invading Ukraine.
Welp, every time Russia says something the opposite tends to occur, so it sounds like the best course of action for the US to take is MORE GUNS FOR UKRAINE!
Lol bro come on if Russia left what do you think is going to happen, NATO allows Ukraine to attack Russia? They even help in some way? Keep dreaming, the best ending for Ukraine is Russia restoring pre invasion borders but they are not going to do that. If anything NATO will start pressuring Ukraine to make some concessions and lose some territory.
Consequences being Russia losing all relevance in world stage and possibly breaking up after Ukraine routs them from whole of Ukraine.
