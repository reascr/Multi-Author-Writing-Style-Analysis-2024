For all those less in the know, all ballistic missiles beyond a certain range, are hypersonic due to their exoatmospheric flight which allows them to easily accelerate without any interruption.
A hypersonic ballistic missile is a missile that boosts itself initially and once the propellant is spent, enters a ballistic trajectory accelerated by gravity into high speeds.
A hypersonic ballistic missile is a missile that follows a ballistic trajectory at high values of mach.
If you just want to the missile to go very fast in a ballistic trajectory, you literally just need a round nosecone.
You only care about aerodynamics if you want the missiles to maneuver after the terminal stage - a feat only very, very few top end missiles can claim to do.
But yeah ballistic missiles have been hypersonic and much longer range for most ppls entire lives and much faster than the short range hypersonic cruise missiles in the news lately.
Ballistic missiles have been doing Mach 20+ for a long long time, but jets and cruises missiles are far from that fast. They just have the option of flatter trajectory, but less range.
