First, it's just fair to those waiting on the courts to resolve the challenges to the forgiveness. No one wants to make payments and then find out later it would've been forgiven if the court challenges had been resolved before payments resumed.
Lastly, I think it shows that Biden's actions on this subject aren't just a cynical political ploy to get votes, coming after the midterms.
Can wasn't kicked in this circumstance unless you are saying Republicans kicked the can and Biden is doing what his constituents want from him?
Now we get to watch as Republicans slowly finger their buttholes and then lose even worse in the election because they continue to alienate the educated members of society and the moderates who aren't psychopath religious nuts.
In that case I definitely agree. Relevant players need to stop blocking things for no reason other than political leanings. This could have all been avoided by the people not blocking it. Student loans would have been forgiven, Biden would have gained additional support, and the people who voted for him on that promise would have had the promise fulfilled.
