They also neglected to mention that the current government is led by a far-right nationalist, and those people seem to like and support Putin. Do you think if trump had won in 2020 the US would be backing Ukraine right now?
Do you have anything more recent? This is from 2015, well before the full scale invasion of Ukraine. Almost all of the nays in congress of aid to Ukraine the last few years have been from the GOP.
There is a similar partisan divide over what to do about the situation in Ukraine. Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to support military assistance. Six-in-ten Republicans voice support for NATO sending arms to the Ukrainian government compared with 39% of Democrats.
Two-thirds of GOP members see Russia as a military threat, but only 56% of Democrats share their fear. And while half of Republicans say Russia is to blame for the violence in eastern Ukraine, just 39% of Democrats agree.
The smallest partisan division is over economic aid to Kyiv: 69% of Republicans back such assistance, as do 60% of Democrats.
The US has bipartisan support for Ukraine. As McCain said in that interview in the Snopes article he was for supporting Ukraine but the democrats weren't. McCain even said that it was the lack of support from democrats for Ukraine that was going to lead to events that transpired in 2022.
