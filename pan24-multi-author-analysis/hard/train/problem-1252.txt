People are missing the bigger point with this bill. The elimination of gender studies and diversity programs is the red meat to get support on the conservative side and distract the liberal opponents.
But that's just one example. Stripping professors of tenure and putting political appointees in charge of hiring and firing will have a silencing effect on teaching and research as well as encouraging professors to work in other states.
So the alternative is letting them get rid of all the tenured professors, drive away anybody else qualified, gut programs and courses, and then stack the faculty with frauds?
The end result will be the firing of liberal professors and replacing them with conservative professors (if they can find enough). The quality of the universities will begin eroding as most professors would prefer to find a job at a university that respects tenure and doesn't have politicians dictating what they can or can't research and teach.
And then the quality of the universities will go down and students will not go there and then the universities will die off and people wont go to school in florida -- reducing its population and destination desire.
