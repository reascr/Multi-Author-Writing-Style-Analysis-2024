If you're thinking this is a gotcha, liberals don't tend to view political parties like football teams, and are generally quite comfortable with a realistic view of individual politicians and the democratic party as a whole. No one is claiming democrats are perfect - just that republican leadership is a steaming pile of bigoted, self-serving dogshit.
Edit: seems I'm getting down voted, likely by republicans who don't like criticism of republicans. However, this comment goes for both Democrats and Republicans who would vote for "their" party regardless of how bad it is.
I mean that's not quite true, every elected Democrat is playing a part in keeping the GOP out of power, it just sucks that it's come down to the wire like this. Again.
...and one other nice thing is that Maryland is pretty purple down at the ground level, even rational Republicans can find a corner to call their own. (I went to school across from a cow farm, the same cow farm that was there when my uncles went there, they've rebuilt the school since I graduated but the farm is unchanged.).
And I'm proud to say that Maryland went blue as fuck in this last election cycle! I mean we're usually pretty blue, but we really blue ourselves this time.
