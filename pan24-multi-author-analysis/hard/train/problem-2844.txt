Once it has enough nukes able to hit the US it will likely try to rejoin the world but it sure as hell not give up the nukes for any reason. NK leadership would rather cripple them selfs than give the US any tiny chance to invade and remove them. China likely would step in to protect NK but not to help them but to keep the buffer zone so would likely toss the leadership under the bus to keep the buffer. That leads NK to not trust China since they know China will only do as little as it can to keep NK a buffer zone and cares little for who runs it.
People are brainwashed in to thinking NK are a bunch of crazy nutters out to destroy the world there just trying to protect them selfs. It has seen what the US likes to do and said fuck that shit that is not for us.
To be safe its that simple. NK dont trust the US at all and that is well justified by the US track record.
Why would the US trust North Korea? Are you saying that a totalitarian regime that literally starves their citizens is a good thing because "USA BAD LOL".
