Several years ago there was some reporting that Washinon D.C. has the highest rate of binge drinking and alcohol misuse even though members of Congress supposedly has a slightly lower percentage of reported alcoholism than the nation. Some members have opened up about being a recovering alcoholic or addict. I suspect those numbers are higher. I'm not interested in anyone's personal private medical struggles, but addiction could be problematic in many ways including security. Privacy is important, but standards we all have should also apply.
Last week I posted a comments similar to yours about getting things in writing and being held to the same standards the working class is held to. I'd love to have every member of Congress apply for a regular job that requires background, credit, and security checks along with drug testing. I suspect a whole bunch of folks couldn't get hired in nongrifting jobs.
You know people are already furiously writing books and screenplays about this. I'd be curious to know who all knew this guy was this much of a fraud. Makes me wonder if there's something more than party line politics. And I pay virtually no attention to conspiracy theories. But I mean c'mon.
Yup. I unfortunately have a cousin who is heavily involved with the “Gays Against Groomers” social media team. They exist and it doesn’t make any sense.
