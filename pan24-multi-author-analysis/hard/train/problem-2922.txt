It is interesting how every time I speak about the whole Western block, someone always come out with "but the Americans...". If we want to dig into the past, the Soviets have killed more Afghans in the first day of operations than the Americans in about 10 years (28.000). You speak about a few thousands foreigner tortured by the Americans. Now compare them with the millions of Russians sent to Gulags. But somehow, they are put on the same level. If this relativism sets through, no one will ever be held accountable for anything and we are back to a free for all.
It is entirely possible to condemn Russia without falling into relativism with America: after all, I am writing from Austria and the US is not "the West".
3. While the US was bombing Vietnam, the Soviet union was still sending millions of its own people into Gulags.
The US killed hundreds of thousands of civilians with chemical weapons, and caused serious illness in millions more.
Hundreds of thousands of citizens were killed in Iraq; perhaps more than a million citizens in total.
