You really really are going to go to your grave with one man tormenting you eternally from inside your head... like the bug Khan put into Pavel Chekov's ear.
(For, the record, I support Ukraine 100%. But I am not idiotic enough to fail to get how bloody dangerous and fraught with life-and-death peril is this casual dismissal of what Russia might do if truly backed into a corner.).
Sure. We sold them weapons prior to the attack this year, including prior to the 2014 invasion of Crimea.
They threatened everyone with nukes if weapons were sent to Ukraine, weapons were sent to Ukraine... and nothing happened.
They threatened nukes if Ukraine fired upon "Russian territory", Ukraine sunk their "flagship" of the Black Sea, fired missiles into Crimea, into Belgorod...nothing happened.
They threatened nuclear terrorism with the nuclear power plant if Ukraine made a push for Kherson, Ukraine pushed for Kherson and liberated it...nothing happened.
There were several threats to individual countries for their contributions to Ukraine like the UK, Poland...nothing happened.
U.S. and European countries were unwilling to provide advanced weaponry to Ukraine if they were just going to fall into Russia's hands in a matter of days. However once it became clear that Ukraine was willing to fight, that the Zelenskiy government remained intact, and that Russia could not achieve its objectives militarily, it was game on for Europe and American military assistance.
