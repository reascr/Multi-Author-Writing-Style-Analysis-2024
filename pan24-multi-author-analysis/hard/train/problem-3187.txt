What the fuck are any of us, AK-47 or not. Going to do against the US military that has jets, tanks, stealth bombers and shit that we've never even seen? But bob with his arthritis can topple the government.
You drop these rednecks off in the middle of Romania and you tell them to go fight their millitary. They'd get their asses kicked. And they're out here thinking they can take on the US government by force.
What kills me about the gun lovers is they always use the excuse of they need them to defend themselves from the government.
My bigger problem with the defense against government tyranny argument is this: when does it count as fighting government tyranny? Do I ever get to go shoot a politician because I think the government has become tyrannical? As far as I can tell, actually using a gun to stop government tyranny is pretty much not a real thing, so why is there such a strong commitment to this idea?
You think itâ€™s a great idea for only police, military, and the people who direct their actions (i.e., people whose main goal in life is to grow their own power and influence) to have all the weapons?
