I’m as lefty as they get, but imo the role of Speaker should not go to the most progressive member. It should be the member most skilled at getting everyone moving on the same page. At the end of the day, the House can only pass what the most conservative Democrat in the Senate agrees with anyway.
Yeah you're right but I thought it was obvious here that we're not talking about the Senate haha. "Congress" is often used as a shorthand for the House, like how you refer to members of the Senate as "Senators" but you refer to members of the House as "Congressmen/women".
Before people come out here and start complaining about how Jeffries is the greatest enemy of progressives to have ever lived, note that he ran unopposed. So I guess the progressives in Congress don't really agree with you.
Let’s be real, he joined the progressive caucus to hamper its efforts. He has been very vocal about his dislike of progressives and their objectives. He is a “money in politics” democrat, just like Pelosi. He doesn’t want to change the game, he doesn’t want to fix this broken system because he doesn’t see it as broken. He is someone who thinks neoliberalism works.
