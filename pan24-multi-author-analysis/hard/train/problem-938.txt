Lock up criminals. And, if they ever held office, be sure there is an example set for future would-be-criminals seeking office.
Anyone who thinks the end justifies the means is foolish. Winning means nothing if we lose our soul along the way. Gaining power by playing dirty will just lead to the normalization of winning by any means necessary. Suddenly, the same kind of people are back in power with a (D) next to their name and we are calling for another escalation of dirty politics to save us from ourselves.
I never said we shouldnâ€™t hold criminals to account. I said that getting dirty is never justified. Laws exist. Holding someone to account for violating any law is not dirty.
Some of these people abused the public trust and broke several laws in the process. That requires that we lock them up (after proper due process of course). This is not corruption. In fact not locking them up would be a better example of corruption.
The Democrats have been so afraid of the public perception of "evil" and "corrupt" that they've frozen themselves into inaction on things that need to occur regardless of how republicans will spin it. They're liars. They lie. The spin will happen with or without us.
These kind of accusations only serve to make the general public associate those of us who are critical of Garland with the crazies and sensationalists.
