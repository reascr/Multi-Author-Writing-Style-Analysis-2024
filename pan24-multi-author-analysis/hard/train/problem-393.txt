"Last week, Yoel Roth, who quit Twitter as Head of Trust and Safety, said as Musk perpetuates lack of legitimacy through his impulsive changes and tweet-lenh pronouncements about platform rules, Twitter is now facing a close scrutiny by both Apple and Google app stores".
So Elon Musk buys twitter and starts advocating for voting for Republicans and certain candidates and we're to expect he will be unbiased in how twitter operates, what algorithms push what articles, etc..?
Is it just me or did Musk turn more radical or aggressive since approximately the twitter acquisition?
He used to always share his views and have random tweet-discussions with folks but recently, his statements have been much more blunt and direct, and in my opinion dangerous.
Dude is aligned with far right extremists all over twitter, only engaging to their requests from him. Banning accounts that expose nazi lovers, banning accounts that help protect lbq groups from maga/proud boy protests, etc. Today he responded like usual to Ian Cheong who posted a fake article about Antifa planning to burn down Tesla factories. Now that he listens to them they are sharing lists to spam 5000 prominent liberal accounts to get banned, and their new thing is “Antifa” are pedophiles.
