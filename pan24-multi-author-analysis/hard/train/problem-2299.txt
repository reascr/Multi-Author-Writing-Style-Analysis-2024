He was and will never be a team player. Hell, he was a democrat before he got into politics. He only changed because people smarter than him made him realize that there is a huge population of people ready to blindly follow him because he’s “a successful businessman and a political outsider”. But to your point…yes, it’s gonna be great to watch his ego destroy himself and to watch him lose for the 2nd time (the presidency anyway). And he’ll conventionally split up the GOP and bring that party that much more close to altogether collapsing.
he's going to split that ticket and it will be chaos before and after the final candidate is chosen on the republican side. The republican party is in worse state than it was after nixon when it was literally on its way out until they revamped the party with the two santa clause theory in the late 70s.
i the early 2000 it was the warmongers and profiteers that caused the second wave, in the 2010's it was the libertarians trying to take hold, and in the 20's it's the racists and anti constitutionalists.
but the problem is that when you have an organization representing a single idea and part of their creedo is power and greed, internally they will always end up choosing sides and smelling armpits, breaking into factions until it dissolves from within.
