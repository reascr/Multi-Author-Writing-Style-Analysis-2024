They’re pushing for a rule that says a handful (5?) can vote for a new speaker at any time. Which would keep the R speaker in the thrall of the most insane, or a rotating chair of failed speakers for the next 2 years.
This is why they passed a pretty big Ukraine aid bill last month. That, and R’s already said they didn’t wanna support it anyway. I doubt we will see more aid to Ukraine coming from congress until 2025.
McCarthy will only lose his re-election if he has a serious challenger. More likely, he’ll retire after getting shit on for the next 2 years like the last 5 Republican speakers did.
Well Dan, a) That’s probably because Republicans can’t govern and don’t deserve any gavels and b) paid off? Democrats didn’t have to do shit, Republicans willingly promoted these idiots and made them the face of your party.
"It's a shame. It makes us look foolish. If I didn't know any better, it's like the Democrats paid these people off," Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Texas Republican, told Fox News. "Let's make it look like the Republicans can't govern and don't deserve any gavels whatsoever. That's what it makes it look like.".
Good. Fuck 'em; couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. It's politicians like McCarthy who are the worst for the country. Only in it for themselves and not for the good of the American people - not that it wasn't obvious by his party affiliation these days, but McCarthy was an especially brash and open example of hypocrisy and saying / taking any position to be in power.
I'd sooner elect him manager for a Waffle House than any house leadership position. McCarthy's decade of waffling and trying to have it both ways within his own party is coming home to roost.
