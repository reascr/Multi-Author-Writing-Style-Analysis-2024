People like Erdogan/Orb√°n still has to make it look like the elections are legit. They are, but they are absolutly unfair. These regimes do cheat but in more insidious ways, mostly by trying to brainwash most of their population with rampant propaganda, fearmongering and by cutting them off from proper education, especially language knowledge so they would be only able to consume the news that their regime feeding to them.
That way, with time, you simple reach a point when you don't need to blatantly cheat on elections, you will have a lot of people who will only believe you, no matter how crazy you are.
The system makes it difficult to cheat, yes, but it certainly does not prevent it from happening - and evidence of fake ballots and dumped ballots appeared in the last election.
2)If the election result does not turn out as desired, some of the votes may be stolen and destroyed. in this case the election is repeated.
The second situation is something that has already happened for years. I've seen it many times when it was in my town, and even my father went in with my grandmother.
