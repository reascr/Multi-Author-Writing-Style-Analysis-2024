People can be snide but considering one MP got caught not paying tax in the millions (and some other lady MP before him), the fact the King is more aware and active in the current poor state of the country is... well rather sad and a demonstration how shitty the conservatives are.
This isn't me defending the royals, it's the best of a bad democracy, I'm just making a point that minuscule or not, the Royals shouldn't "appear" to do more for the public than our own government.
Personally (while my own republican sensibilities might make me biased) I struggle to envision a situation where the monarchy is able to be dissolved but still somehow able to keep all the perks of the position. As you correctly state, the crown estate does not belong to Charles (contrary to the claims of more than one Reddit monarchist), so I don't see that there's much more cause for them to keep that than to keep, say, exemption from taxes or whatever. No crown, no crown estate.
There's no roadmap for dissolving the monarchy because obviously there isn't. If/when the monarchy is finally gotten rid of, it's not going to be the royal family that makes the decisions.
Well we're talking about what would happen _if_ the monarchy was dissolved, so suggesting that would never happen is at best completely irrelevant.
And in what hypothetical would the public support abolishing the monarchy and seizing commercial properties across the country?
