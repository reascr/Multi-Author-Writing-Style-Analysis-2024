Before anyone doesn't read the article: police and prison officers are already not able to strike because, let's face it, it would be an absolute disaster having no law enforcement for x days. There were 3 options suggested: one of which was to add border force to the policing / prison services group and have them not able to strike, or set minimal service levels for them. Minimal service levels was chosen and is what was put in place this week for all the sectors: ensuring minimal service and safety levels are adhered to through stikes.
It's predicted to be some very strange results. In Scotland, Labour are predicted to get back some seats: older snp voters being more against the gender recognition act are switching to labour, while people who voted tory are supposed to be moving to snp. So tory loses seats, snp stays even, Labour gains (I think it's estimated 6 seats).
And London is likely to largely return labour mps, while the northern brexit voters will likely still vote tory.
Why do people in England keep voting conservative again? At this point I just want to hurry independence along because I donâ€™t want rights being eroded by conservative governments.
