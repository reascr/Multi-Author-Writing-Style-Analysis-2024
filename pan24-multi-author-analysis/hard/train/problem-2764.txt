is a write up on the way companies charge more and yet display "Made in America" whilst also having "assembled in China" on products. Companies know they don't have make it all in America in order to put "Made in America" on something and charge you 10% more.
All Russia has done is put China in the driving seat against the West and China wants to keep trading with us.
And then China will supply Russia and feel enabled to renegotiate all US-China economics. Thatâ€™s what I see as next events.
This might get messy. I had not thought about the tit for tat arms to Russia vs Taiwan. I think the west would rather have a Cold War than have Taiwan destroyed and rebuilt as a massive China naval base and shipyard for administration of the SCS. China will point out the hypocrisy and the US will say they are supporting a right to self determination just like Ukraine.
First I fully support Ukraine and think we should give even more and be looking at diplomatic channels to convince even China to oppose Russia. My post was pointing out why we don't care about the genocide and enslavement going on in China compared to the invasion of Ukraine.
Like it or not, there is a racial element to it. Same reason we didn't support Syria Vs Ukraine despite a lot of similarities in the situation on the ground. It's not even close to the only reason of course, but it's not irrelevant either.
The other is making it harder to import cheap stuff from China for some Muslims. Or putting lives on the line for, and weapons in the hands of, brown people that don't have oil. Or treating inmates as if they're humans.
