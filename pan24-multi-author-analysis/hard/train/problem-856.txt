It’s almost as if…and stick with me here cause this gets weird, but it’s almost as if the whole war started because Russia wanted Ukraine, or parts of it at the very least, and Ukraine didn’t want to give them that.
It's a bad spot cause Russia's not in any spot to completely invade Ukraine, but neither is Ukraine in any spot to completely invade Russia to force a conclusion. So there's always a chance this ends like Korea, with a long term armistice after pushing everyone back to the borders they started with, after massive loss of life, rather than any sort of peace treaty. I do wonder what happens the second Ukraine finishes pushing Russia out of Crimea though, since unlike Korea, pushing into Russia to force concessions and an end isn't something most people want.
It bothers me that so many people are trying to use this as a example of Ukraines aggressiveness and unwillingness to make peace when it’s Russia who is unwilling to compromise.
Russians still don't understand the simple fact that them leaving territory of Ukraine is not subject to negotiation, that's the condition. Subject of negotiation is only how much will they pay in reparations before the sanctions can be dropped.
