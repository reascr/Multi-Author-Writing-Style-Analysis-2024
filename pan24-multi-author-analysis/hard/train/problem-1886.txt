I agree that it's a possibility. If either end up outside of 300 votes difference the recount is most likely a waste of time and money but I'm sure will happen anyways.
What I mean was they were getting votes at near equal rates for the entire day and now suddenly there's 500 votes peeling her way.
Politicians who scrape together narrow wins used to start by thinking "How can I woo more people to vote for me next time so that it's not so close?" They'd try to build bridges, make compromises.
At least a third of every state (and sometimes up to a half) is unhappy with their political landscape at the moment. Only 3 states have a governor with more than two thirds of the population's support. That has always struck me as shitty.
Yea that’s gotta hurt. Warnock should be a dream candidate who checks every box. And your goofball neighbors voting for a brain damaged horn dog. Maybe Warnock should have ran as a republican without changing a thing about his platform. Wouldn’t that be an interesting experiment to see who actually looks past the D in front of his name. Anyway May god bless you in Georgia with a victory for that good man.
