Everyone should just become gay then they wouldn’t need birth control that would really send them into a tailspin I mean they don’t want us having sex for enjoyment so.
But I also really fucking hate hypocrites and these guys are among the first to go "tHaTs NoT iN tHe CoNsTiTuTiOn" when gay people demand that their basic human rights be protected too.
I fucking hate the "tHaTs NoT iN tHe CoNsTiTuTiOn" arguments. Just because something isn't spelled out in the constitution, doesn't mean it isn't a protected right.
That's why we have the Constitution and it's bill of amendments. We recognized as time went on that just saying people are born with certain inalienable rights isn't good enough, you have to enshrine them in law so that everyone from the West Coast to the east coast respects those rights.
I grew up in southern Louisiana and still have family members down there that say the civil war was a war of northern aggression over states rights.
Just want to point out that nobody in the confederacy thought they were fighting The Civil War because of "State's Rights". One of the major causes of the Civil War was the Fugitive Slave Act which allowed the Federal Government to trample over State's Rights in order to find fugitive slaves, and the Confederate Constitution was basically the American Constitution, only with Confederacy completely losing the State Right of deciding Slavery.
In the later 1800s, long after the Civil war was over and when most people, even those in the South, had concluded that Slavery was immoral, "State's Rights" was retconned to be the "real" reason of the Civil War. Again, this is a retcon and nobody in the Civil War would even know what "State's Rights" is.
