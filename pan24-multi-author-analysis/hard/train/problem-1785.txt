What's their reasoning for why kids should go hungry? Let me guess, they're Christians too, right? Doesn't seem very Christian to want kids to starve.
I guess those kid's parents shouldn't have had them. Welp, time for the kids to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
We were children. It shocks me how heartless some of the commenters here are. I doubt they have had to beg their friends parents for food before.
If I didn’t eat all there was at home was tortilla chips and jarred cheese dip, or maybe some Ho-hos because food banks sometimes only have sweets to pass out. I got over that embarrassment real quick.
Free public school lunches kept my siblings and I fed through public school! This is such a shame. If I didn’t have that one solid meal a day I may have taken to after school grocery theft (the gateway crime) like some of my similarly-starved peers.
In 5th grade I had an especially challenging home life and frequently went to school with no lunch. There was a free brown bag lunch they brought for the kids who had signed up and I think my teacher realized I wasn’t bringing food so maybe asked that I be given one too. That was a lifesaver for me because I wasn’t going to complain even though being hungry all day was the worst.
