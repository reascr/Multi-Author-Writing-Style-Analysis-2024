Lol this book isn’t about sales. He’s obviously positioning for a presidential run on a “take the party back from maga” platform. He’s done this interview, and one with CNN. Plus the book.
He’s trying to wipe four years of being in Trump’s administration off his shirt before he sits down at the primary table. Doesn’t seem doable, and frankly, I don’t think anyone in R-world other than DeSantis has a chance at beating Trump in a primary, especially not someone positioning himself across the maga base.
DeSantis also has the charisma of a wet napkin and I doubt he would win against against a decent Dem candidate nor could he form a mass cult like Trump did. Of course I could be wrong.
I was wrong. While he is screwed up in the head, he has no morals and sells out for whoever is paying. Seems pretty contradictory to his “religious beliefs”.
Wow, it really took Mike Pence a while to speak out against Trump for what he tried to do to him on 1/6. I always though that Pence was a religious man with morals and was just screwed up in the head.
He believes that god acts through unholy people... He believes the ends justify the means. He believes in eternal damnation unless he converts people into members of his specific religion. He believes in theocracy. He believes in lying to achieve theocracy. He believes in things that aren't true, to everyone's detriment.
