I read a book, sorry can't remember the name of it, were rebels tried to fight a global nation/corporation amalgam and their last holdouts were in some kind of jungle. The Nation/Corp. had huge, slow but mobile fortesses with Sci-Fi lasers that basically burned a few miles of the jungle every time they fired and adwanced to surround the remaining jungle, while buring it down at the same time.
They were described as only a little larger than a humming bird but would attack in the hundreds on one target and if they found a large group of targets were able to call for more drones.
Imagine the drones that identify people and armour sending telemetry (aotomatically) to call in more drones or artilery.. You could coordinate a strike of 1000s of artilery and drones to hit in the same few seconds.
Just imagine fairly small fixed wing drones armed with automatic 40mm granade launchers flying over enemy trenches and automatically enganging once they spot enemy soldiers. No EW will help because drone is on pre-planned path and is capable to make his own decision to engade.
