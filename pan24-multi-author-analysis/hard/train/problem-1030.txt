Georgia Republicans sure did like runoffs in all the years they flipped a Democratic win in the general to a Republican win in the runoff. Acting only when Republicans start losing runoff elections after decades of winning them makes the timing conspicuous.
The notion that Raffensperger is opposing runoffs to try to consolidate Republican power is laughable.
. He's also infamous for standing up to Trump when he was calling around, begging for votes. Plus, he's breaking ranks with his entire party to join Democrats in opposing runoffs. So no, I don't think he wants to change it to where they get to pick if it's close to a tie.
Georgia Democrats heavily favor getting rid of runoffs, partly because it's a holdover from post-segregation attempts at curbing the Black vote, and partly because it makes voting harder, which is to say it's voter suppression. Raffensperger is breaking with the rest of his party to join the left here. He's also as a replacement for runoffs. Finally, he's infamous for being . The idea that this guy has anything to do with Republicans trying to cheat their way to victory is laughable lol.
I think it's weird to assume that simply because Republicans are losing the run-offs that is why Raffensperger wants rid of them. The simple fact is that NOBODY likes run-off elections. Raffensperger's office even offers ranked-choice voting as an alternative.
Honestly, I think that everyone in Georgia is just legitimately tired of it. It is incredibly burdensome and unnecessary. I'm no fan of the GOP and particularly Georgia Republicans but Raffensperger appears to be guy with whom I politically disagree but I wouldn't consider an enemy of democracy like many of his Georgia brethren like MTG.
