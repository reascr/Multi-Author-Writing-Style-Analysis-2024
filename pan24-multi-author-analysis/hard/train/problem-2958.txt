Err... That was what retirement age was meant to be once. It's just that we raised the life expectancy. I am not saying it is a good thing to die younger, but the whole point is that you are not suppose to have decades of retirement.
If you want to go a little further in the details of the system, the 62\64 thing is when people can start retiring. But the French pension system also requires you to work for at least a specific duration, which is 43 years.
It means that the profile of someone who will retire at 62 and get the full pension is someone who started working at 19yo (or possibly someone who started a little later but got "bonus time" from harsh jobs or raisin children or other exceptions).
So, while raising the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 may indeed allow to collect more retirement contributions from worker (as well as decreasing the amount or retirement pension to pay!), this specific aspect of the reform is perceived as disproportionately penalizing poorer, diplome-less workers (who possibly have a lower life expectancy on top of that). And when the government pushing this project claims that it's for protecting our redistributive tax system, it's really starting to sound like BS. Hence the angry population.
