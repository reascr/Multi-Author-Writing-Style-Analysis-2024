In this intercepted call, a Russian soldier tells his wife about a failed assault operation with no support, surviving a direct missile strike, and Russian forces "writing off" friendly fire as casualties taken from Ukrainians.
Itâ€™s not the Groundhog Day. Just Russians mine-clearing the area with their MBTs and trying to find every single mine placed by Ukrainian troops near Vuhledar.
I have read that the Russian thought they had cleared the mines but Ukraine was able to replace them before the attack, so thatt's why they are confused.
I'm pretty sure this ofensive is a last gasp, desperate move by Russia to try to reclaim some land before the western tanks start arriving in Ukraine. Russia knows after the Ukrainians are trained and running in technologically superior tanks, that there's not much they can do to stop them.
No surprise that now Ukraine is targeting artillery in large numbers to cut russia's offensive back-bone. Commanders can once again delay until more artillery arrives or go ahead with insufficient shelling.
The enemy made another fruitless attempt to advance with several tanks through the minefield. Throughout the day even more vehicles and assaulting infantry groups have been eliminated, few POW's were captured.
