I both like and don't like this idea. The thought that students and teachers could exist in a supportive learning environment is great, but their absence from schools integrated with their cis, straight or allosexual peers is a net loss. Ultimately, it's better to make the space than let them suffer abuse elsewhere, but dammit, all schools should be queer friendly schools!
I know where you are coming from but with so much hatred against lgbt people in schools I would much rather send them to this school instead of exposing them to such hatred and violence in public schools.
They are trying to shut down public schools and erase LGBTQIA+ students, diverting the money to start schools for Christian nationalists.
Don't see GOP states like FL allowing gay schools so it would only be possible in liberal states in which case pushing for inclusivity would be a better path.
They also had help for kids with gender issues, all that is going away in GOP states where white supremacy, ignorance and hate are the guiding principles. FL rules are homosexuality cannot be discussed or even referenced.
