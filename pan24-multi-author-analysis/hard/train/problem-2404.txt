Bad strategy. Democrats should offer all of their votes to any little group of GOP if that would mean a different speaker. If no group in the GOP exists then this is okay. But otherwise, the Democrats ought to be kingmaker.
While that would be hilarious I don't know how that's better for the Democrats. They're better to try and squeeze concessions out of McCarthy and have some of their members vote for him.
And no Republican will go along with that because it will just be the extremists going against McCarthy and no one wants to be the guy that let the Democrats pick the Republican Speaker.
McCarthy will be the Speaker. At most, Democrats might be able to extract a few concessions from him. My bet would be concessions related to removing Democratic members from committees.
I mean, not really. They would need Republicans to vote with them. They're not going to vote for a Democrat for Speaker just because they don't like McCarthy.
Yes and those Republicans may vote against McCarthy but they will never vote with Democrats to elect a Democrat-approved Speaker. It would be political suicide.
