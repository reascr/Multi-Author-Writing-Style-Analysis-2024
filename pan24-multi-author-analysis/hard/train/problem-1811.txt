If robbery carries a 5 to 25 years sentence, and person A was found with the stolen property in their possession gets 5 years, and person B was found with the property along with the bloody knife from a homicide that happened during the robbery and grainy video evidence of the person who did the killing being the one taking the property, where it's likely they are the one who did it, but some room for minor doubt about murder, and they get 20 years- I'm kind of OK with that concept.
No. The defendant was found guilty on federal robbery charge of controlled substance. Which is up to 20 years. If I understand correctly, the armed part of the conviction tacks on 5 more, so up to 25 years. (The murder part would have allowed up to life). The 19 year sentence is within the scope of what is allowed by law for the charge that they were convicted for.
The key point being if the sentences are both within the range allowed for the crime that was convicted. Now, if the sentence is adding on extra time beyond what is allowed for the convicted crime, taking some from the acquitted crime- that isn't right.
The whole point here is that the acquitted portions of the alleged crime shouldn’t factor into the sentence for the convicted portion of the alleged crime.
“In courtrooms across America, defendants get additional prison time for crimes that juries found they didn’t commit.”.
"Sentencing a defendant for what’s called “acquitted conduct” has gone on for years, based on a Supreme Court decision from the late 1990s. And the justices have turned down numerous appeals asking them to declare that the Constitution forbids it.".
