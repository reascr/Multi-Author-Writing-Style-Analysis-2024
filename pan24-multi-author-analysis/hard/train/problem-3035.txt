Except the part where an organization that shoots deserters or just uncooperative troops extended his contract indefinitiavely (spelling?) without his consent. And just finding it unacceptable to live under a regime that so blatantly commits and endorses warcrimes.
So probably because of his military experience, and the fact he wasn't actually recruited straight from prison. At least that's where I'd put my money.
So, let me get your logic right. He's looking to save his own life by fleeing to another country and threatening to testify to the warcrimes Russia has commited? The same Russia that famously has had dissidents in foreign nations assassinated?
Russian is known to assassinate guys like him in foreign countries. Being the first guy to produce evidence of war crimes is a brave thing to do seeing as no one else is doing it.
Umm he has evidence of war crimes and is clearly willing to testify. Thatâ€™s very useful information .
Then fled to Norway to request asylum as his country was committing mass war crimes and is willing to produce evidence.
While Norway has a history of accepting such asylum requests, we have a worse history of being able to protect them from assassination. But we'd really rather not have another repeat of Trotsky, so maybe we've got our act together since then...
