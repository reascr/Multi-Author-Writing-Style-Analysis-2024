You would just never know when thing would just scatter the most after all, destruction is what it all causes.
When buildings get destroyed due to earthquake and people lose their lives that stuff is indeed difficult enough to watch over!
Even the strongest building gets destroyed though when earthquakes just hits the fact that a 6 magnitude earthquake hit my place.
Is It true that the Richter scale is not particularly useful when it comes to measuring nearby quakes larger than magnitude than 6.0-7.0? I know the physical seismograph can only physically record about that high if you're near the epicenter of because there isn't actually room for the pen to measure higher than that. I believe most devices are digital now, but do they run into the same problem?
When they tapped out the song for a listener, however, only around 2% of people were able to name the song. There was a huge discrepancy between what the person tapping thought would be obvious and what was really obviously to an uninformed person.
What you first referenced is an actual phenomenon called the Curse of Knowledge. When you're an expert or at least somewhat well-versed in a field or a topic, it totally warps your view of the public's general knowledge about that topic.
That concept translates to just about every field. It's easy to wildly misinterpret the layperson's understanding of a subject when you're an expert in it, or to think something is common knowledge when it's actually rather obscure. It's just how our brains work.
