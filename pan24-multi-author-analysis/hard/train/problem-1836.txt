Secondly, there could be people in Russia with some connection to our respective countries that would benefit from our embassies continuing to operate within Russia, which they almost surely would not if we close down their embassies in our countries.
I doubt they have any noticeable effect on the populations of Western countries. If someone in a Western country is inclined to sympathise with Russia, they will find information to support that view everywhere on the internet, from sources that are much better at marketing Russian propaganda than various Russian embassies.
No practical purpose would be served by that, other than dick-swinging, and escalation, and it will put westerners in Russia in further jeopardy by Russia probably taking reciprocal action.
Personally I don’t think everyone should do it, but severe cutbacks on allowed Russian personnel should happen, and you really only need a few countries to have the connection. I don’t think that will happen tho.
Have you looked at Russians history In the Baltic’s… they have good reason to hate Russia… and if Russia wins or gets away with this, Ukraine is very high up on their target list(based on the same intelligence agencies that earned us of the invasion, Russia was originally planning on invading the baltics first before Maiden happened)… for them this is a literal matter of life and death, so yeah they are going to take a very hard line, and they aren’t going to take kindly to countries that Stand neutral or on the side of a country that is an active threat against it.
Additionally the US didn’t support Pakistan. US Congress Imposed an arms embargo on Pakistan, journalist reported on the atrocities, protestors blocked ports to prevent Nixon from supporting pakistan and the diplomats in the US were allowed to defect.
Must be nice having the USSR backing you up to gain its independence, when the Baltics and most of Easter Europe where split between Hitler’s Nazi Germany and Stalin.
