One of the under-acknowledged difference between news on the left and on the right. People on the left laughed at Trump for months for saying we should use UV lights and bleach to kill covid inside of people or covfefe. A liberal says "Israel shouldn't be genociding civilians" or "this thing causes more greenhouse emissions" and Fox acts like we're declaring war on God and country.
I feel like the general American populace is aware of this. It sucks that the 75% of Americans make up just under 50% of voting power due to our backwards-ass system of giving power to land instead of the people living on it.
That’s probably because 75% of Americans are not conservatives, and we’re being run from the rich minority by a bunch of voter suppression techniques.
I can assure you, nearly 100% of those House Republicans do not care about those 75% of Americans who believe they aren’t paying attention to the most important problems. They are a ruling minority party ruling for an ever shrinking minority.
