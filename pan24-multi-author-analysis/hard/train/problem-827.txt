Right? There was so little traffic that the only background noise was all the building services, HVAC etc, not traffic. Like I never would have realised how noisy buildings are without the pandemic stopping traffic.
If you are in traffic you are causing traffic. If you can't find parking, maybe driving was a stupid idea?
The solution is incentivising people to making the right decisions. Driving is almost never the right decision. Buying a house in a car dependent suburb is never the right decision. Buying a pickup truck is never the right decision. Cities all over the country are ripping out highways because cars suck to be around and cars suck to be in.
And this always gets so much worse in cities for one simple reason. Cities can build more living space and workspace on top or below of existing space. But doing that with roads is damned near impossible on any large scale.
How did we get to the point where the "highways are effectively unusable"? We built and built and built more and more and more highways. Why would you expect it to ever change if we keep doing the same thing?
This right here is the reason we keep doing it. Because the average voter "knows" that it has to be done anyway. It's obvious. And anybody who seriously argues against it would get voted out of office.
