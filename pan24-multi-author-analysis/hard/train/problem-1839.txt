Basically, Russia's stance is "give us whatever we want, and we will start to negotiate your surrender.".
True. I guess we really can't say if anything was net good or net bad until we are out of it. What sounds bad for Russia now might just be bad for everyone given some time if it means they are finally passing the threshold of not caring about being perceived as aggressive.
Exactly. All I see is that China has just been "handed" an ultimatum that ensures no peace unless Russia controls Ukraine. They now have justification for escalation and can say "well, we would have preferred Plan A but you guys all saw how that worked out, so we had to change course".
Russia is giving China, and the world, the ultimatum of “Give me Ukraine or I won’t stop”, but I don’t think we can assume this whole proposal by China was done in good faith.
I'm more interested to see if China will try to press Russia to accept a deal not acceptable to Putin to keep their logic on Taiwan consistent or drop support for Russia because fuck Russia's geopolitical goals, China's goals are more important to China than Russia's goals.
I think they could've used the russian argument that those territories were always russian, therefore Russia has the right to maintian its integrity with those regions (all of which is ofcourse complete bs on the russian part), and then use that to support their claim of Taiwan and Hong Kong, but they at least didn't likely because they know Russia will lose anyways so best not to hitch your horse to that.
