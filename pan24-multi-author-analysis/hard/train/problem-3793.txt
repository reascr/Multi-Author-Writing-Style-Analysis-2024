Attacking Sweden without going through Finland isn't impossible, but it's a lot harder than the other way around. I could see why Finland may want Sweden to wait, but no reason why Sweden wouldn't tell Finland to go first.
Sweden obviously has no say over what Finland, a sovereign country decides to do. However I think most of us Swedes would be understanding if Finland decided to join on their own. They are in a more exposed position than Sweden geographically, and it would increase safety for Sweden as well by nearly surrounding us with NATO countries. However most are probably grateful that Finland will join together with Sweden when/if the time comes, as was always the plan.
It is the desire of both Finland and Sweden, as well as all major NATO allies, that the two countries join at the same time. This is not set in stone, however. Finland is also having an election this spring, and the next administration might be OK with entering NATO before Sweden does.
But Haavisto said he still hoped Finland and Sweden would become NATO members in the next few months.
But Haavisto said security assurances from the United States, Britain and other NATO members meant that Finland could be patient.
We have underlined to all our future NATO partners, including Hungary and Turkey, that Finnish and Swedish security go together," he said.
Sweden has said it takes Turkey's security concerns seriously and is implementing the three-way agreement signed in June last year, but Ankara says it is not doing enough.
Turkey wants Sweden, in particular, to take a clearer stance against what it sees as terrorists, mainly Kurdish militants and a group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.
