The stunningly idiotic Russian take is not that Ukrainians can't physically (due to lack of ability) attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine....it's the stated position that it is MORALLY WRONG for Ukraine to attack Russian assets being used to attack Ukraine. It is astounding. "Don't you DARE attack our missile launching jets that we are using to wreck you mutherfuckers, your mothers, your children, your schools and hospitals. You are morally obligated to let us kill you.".
Good. But the NYT articles today have been absolute trash today repeating how this is Ukraine "escalating" the war. No dickheads, this is self defense hitting the military site that has repeatedly attacked Ukraine in an unprovoked war. What is Ukraine supposed to just let itself get attacked again and again without response?
I had read, that the reason Ukraine hadn't attacked back, is because it would lose them support / favour of other nations (Nato / UN).
As long as Ukraine is not using NATO weapons to do these strikes then there should not be any negative repercussion to Ukraine from the west. I don't believe Macron is going to complain about Ukraine over this.
