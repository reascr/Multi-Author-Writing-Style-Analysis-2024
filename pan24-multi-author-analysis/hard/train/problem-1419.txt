The Russian Federation's days are numbered at this point, the question now is just when and how it implodes, and what comes next.
Russia and Putin were really counting on this winter to pressure Europe into caving, and it just hasn't happened. By this time next year there will be no reason to even consider Russia as a primary fuel supplier, but the harm Russia has done to itself and its reputation as a source of energy will be set in stone.
Geopolitics can explain why the supplier (in this case Russia) isn't awfully reliable but that won't change the fact that their actions (using their energy exports as a weapon) have resulted in greatly reduced demand. This greatly reduced demand is what's letting China and India buy Russian energy at greatly reduced prices.. something they weren't able to do when Europe was still buying Russian oil and gas.
Basic market economics is supply and demand, when you prove to be an unreliable supplier demand will naturally go way down. Too little demand means greatly reduced prices.
