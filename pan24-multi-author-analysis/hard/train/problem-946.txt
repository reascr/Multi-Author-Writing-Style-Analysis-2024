It reminds me of how you guys defend the concentration camps. You guys won't criticize China for it but moment the US has an officer that beat up a BLM protestor, you guys quickly say "see, US is not different!".
Exactly what all the pro CCP types always say to defend China. So China has unfair business practices that you all defend but the moment the US does anything to retaliate or limits what Chinese companies can do in the US, you guys quickly criticize the US.
Like /u/Ayylmaothoughyaknow said, There’s no fair play in China so why should you or China get made when roles are reversed?
There is no 'level playing field' when doing business in China. Why in the hell should there be one in the US? Why in the fuck should the US play nice here?
Until every Chinese company doing business in the US is forced to do go through a US equivalent company while allowing an agent of the US government to be present at all times, no mater how sensitive the matter, I really don't give a fuck.
Lol I am no way defending China but to say all current “US companies have an agent of the US government that is present all the time” is false. If that was the case we wouldn’t see FTX on the news.
