Well gee, why would their neighbours want missile DEFENSE SYSTEMS. It's almost like countries bordering Russia are afraid of missile strikes for some weird reason.
They don't know the meaning of sovereignty, just that if other countries have it then Russia will seek to undermine it. It exists to be violated as far as Russia is concerned.
The same can mostly be said for China too. They see western trust and agreements as something to exploit, agreements to adhere to only as a means of restraining the west so long as it's beneficial to them and the moment they think they found an opportunity to capitalize on it to hinder the west they will absolutely do so.
Says the country with the worst record of respecting the sovereignty of its neighbors going back literally centuries. The more I learn about how Russian governments targeted their neighbors in every conceivable way to either control by weaponized migrants and generational conversion or by brute force always using terrorism like mass rape and genocide the more I realize Russia can't get along with the west, it's hardwired into their culture and ways of government both subtly and blatantly to see western diplomacy and its systems of agreements as vulnerabilities to be exploited and capitalized on with the sole purpose being domination through any means necessary.
