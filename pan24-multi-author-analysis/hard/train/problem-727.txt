Headlines should contain more qualifiers or details, but generally if they explain in the first paragraph it's not that bad. A headline is just meant to catch someone's eye and convey a bare bone statement. It can/should be inferred what they are talking about, to a degree. When a governing body like a state government is talking about banning a word, it has to do with the usage of that word within the jurisdiction of that area of government.
In general banning words seems like a silly thing for government to do. But as a white person I dont really get much of a say here. If Latinos want the word banned from government use, thats fine.
A smaller group of latinos find the effort to change the word at all offensive, though. Based on the quote from the sponsor of this bill, it seems he would fall into that camp. Some people see this effort as the product of white people and third-generation latinos who primarily speak English to change their language from the outside, and consider the effort an attack on their own language and culture.
Finally consider this, your point "white English speakers trying to change Spanish grammar when the English word, Latin Americannis naturally gender neutral" is very similar to what these Dems are trying to do.
Maybe. Maybe not. However, that is irrelevant. Someone might know more is a very poor argument. Fortunately, this is binary argument and we can easily explore both outcomes. If we carry out your thinking to it's conclusion assuming either option is true, it seems obviously wrong to me.
Conversely, if I unquestionably know less, does that mean my opinion should be considered the incorrect opinion? I would say no. The flaws in my argument should be pointed out before my opinion is taken as wrong. The same should apply to Gallego.
So, Gallego claims to be offended. Why? What is offensive? I did look, but didn't see a reason. Conservative claim to be offended without reason too...
