This can not be overstated. Judges are supposed to be impartial. I understand that true impartiality doesnâ€™t exist but certain SCOTUS judges could at least cut down on the blatant political bias.
I mean we should also understand the posturing of the conservative judges, and how each can "dissent" on any given ruling to try and maintain some veneer of "reasonability" or "impartiality", while they as a whole know they will still get done whatever they want.
As for judicial term limits, in the theoretical system you've created, why would you refuse a knowledgeable and healthy judge from a return to the bench if the incoming congress believes they're still capable and would serve the country well for another 18? Nearly all of the same justifications for the removal of term limits on elected officials carries over 1:1 with justices.
The judiciary are unelected positions so it makes more sense to give them terms of a set duration. Personally, i like the 18 year terms for 9 justices coupled with a system where every new congress appoints a Justice to replace the outgoing justice. It gives every election meanjng and it ensures the make up of the court at least some what matches the current sentiments of our voting population.
Congressional term limits are a different beast than Presidential or Judicial. Elections act as term limiters for congress. If youre representing your constituents well and they support your actions in congress, you'll be reelected. If not, you're gone.
