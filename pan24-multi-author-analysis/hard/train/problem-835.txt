I was surprised that in parts of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado there's little prickly pear cactus all over the place. I noticed them in Crestone, which is definitely one of the colder areas in the mountains. I'm not sure if "cactus" really says much about a climate.
There are also hardy cactuses. I live in the Upper Midwest in the States and I keep barrels of them outside on the deck year round. Green bees love the flowers and the fruit is really nice, even though there are so many seeds. Like if a strawberry was in the form of a raspberry, if you can imagine that.
Uncertain. My deck is a sun-blasted hellscape in summer. “Bright shade” could be okay, and mine live under feet of snow for weeks at a time every winter. Opuntia something or other. I got my first pads from a guy on eBay who lived in northern MN, grew them on the side of his house.
They have both long, relatively fat and very painful needles, as well as tufts of sticky tiny needles that will never leave you. Instead, consider planting along the entire perimeter for effective home defense .
