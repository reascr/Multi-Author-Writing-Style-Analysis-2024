It’s nothing that [checks notes] absolutely everyone [edit: in the US] hasn’t done, turning temporary Covid setbacks into rampant inflation, across the board. And is labor getting any of it? No. No they’re not.
Are they? They seem more expensive to me. I'm not 100% sure. I was looking at eggs the other day and decided to just not get any because of the price.
One store I went to that has reasonable prices for eggs (all local farmers) was stripped clean of its eggs. Another store that is posting the price gouging was fully stocked and nobody was buying the eggs.
so that shortage creates higher prices as competition (Walmart/Kroger/ALDI) bids up the price to have eggs in stock so .....
Culture and consumer demand have changed. One onion and 1 onion pre cut up are the same thing, except the pre cut onion comes with an added higher costs and profit margin.
I made record profits, even near doubled my profits. All because people wanted a better product that was already in the store.
