As long as something remains a wedge issue (marijuana, abortion, etc) you’re not going to see any meaningful attempt to change it. Because then you cannot run on that wedge issue next election season. Name of the game is milking shit for as long as you can, unfortunately. If democrats actually gave a fuck about abortion, they’d have protected it federally 10 years ago. If republicans actually gave a fuck about gun rights, they’d be serious about de stigmatizing suppressors. On a federal level it’s all a racketeering scheme where you run based on “other side is going to take X away” and don’t do anything to protect it once you win so you can rinse and repeat later on in your career.
It’s almost like rights that aren’t explicitly stated in the constitution should be protected by law, passed by lawmakers, and not left up to a body that’s supposed to determine whether or not laws are constitutional.
So what good would any of the rights in the Constitution do, if the legislature could ignore it and no one could tell them otherwise?
If the rights in the Constitution weren't enforceable, they would be meaningless. And the only enforcement mechanism that currently exists is that a court can say "Nope, guys, this violates the Constitution, and that outranks a regular old law, so this is void and the courts won't enforce it. If you want to make that change, you have to pass an amendment.".
Lmao. She's actually only in the widest frame photos and videos. For the most part, you don't see her because she's off screen behind Harris and Dr. Biden with Dianne Feinstein and Sharice Davids.
