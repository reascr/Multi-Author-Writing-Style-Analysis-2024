Tyrants have always some slight shade of virtue; they support the laws before destroying them. --- Voltaire.
Those people will talk how they support free speech and constitution until they take power and then destroy them.
Their free speech is restricting other free speech. It’s like how their “freedom of religion” is their freedom to restrict equal rights.
Free speech, as a Constitutional right, doesn't enter into this at all. Twitter is a private company and can allow or disallow whatever they want.
If a for profit service or product displeases you, walk away from it and tell everyone you know that it sucks. That's the solution here.
Exactly. It's just another way for right wing wannabe authoritarians to pretend they're being oppressed.
I think narcissism is part of it, certainly on the part of many right-wing politicians advocating the right-wing version of free speech. However I think there's another aspect to it and that is the willingness of conservative voters to believe what the narcissists are saying.
