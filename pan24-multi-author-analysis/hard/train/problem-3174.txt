That would be like web browsers requiring a 30% cut whenever you buy something online, because you're using their software to render your site or app. It's no coincidence that isn't the case though- that's because the web is open, vs closed within for example the Apple ecosystem. I mainly speak to Apple, because Google does allow alternative app stores on Android.
If Google also requires that apps are priced the same even on desktop and not on Google-powered devices, then Google is equally anticompetitive as apple.
It isn't about being a "fair" rate- Apple and Google don't deserve 30% of your business simply because you developed an app on their platform.
Correct me if I’m wrong but if you just use it thru a browser apple doesn’t get 30/15% the fee is for using the App Store. Is that correct ?
Is that true? Apple truly is just a dictatorship of a company. They have a complete corner on so much of the population of developed countries. In regard to what they can do on the internet/through apps. And how anything people buy through their devices gets heavily taxed by the government Apple.
Why should I as a PC user pay more because Apple, who creates devices I don't use, says so? How is that good for the consumer?
