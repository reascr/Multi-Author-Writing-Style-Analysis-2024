Most Christians have either read a significant amount, or the entirety of, the bible. They probably have not done it straight through, but throughout all of the Sunday School classes, youth groups, and readings in church they have read pretty much all of it if they were raised in church. It is long, but it is not that long and sermons tend to repeat for lack of content over the years.
The problem is that when people accuse them of "not reading it" it is incorrect. They all do to some extent, or at least have, and so they see that as an unjustified attack on their character. It is much, much better to go with the truth: They do not understand what they are reading.
But I have seen people literally use a word in Greek, translate it to Hebrew, then look up all the uses of that translated Hebrew word spanning hundreds of years and try to force those connotations on the Greek term from another few hundred years later. It is linguistic abuse.).
This. They’ve been searching for that accountability ceiling for years and they have yet to find it. At this point I’m pretty sure it doesn’t exist. Which is really bad news for our future.
The bad thing is some made up scenario in their heads. It’s different for each one of them. Can be some anti vax nonsense or a Q-style conspiracy theory.
