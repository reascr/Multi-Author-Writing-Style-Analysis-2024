The text in the Constitution is vague enough that it requires judicial interpretation/caselaw to reach a conclusion. I’m not sure what the caselaw looks like, but that’s not the same thing as saying that he is definitively federally eligible to run for Senate.
If questioned, he could certainly claim to have moved his primary residence between Georgia and Texas multiple times in both 21 and 22, but we all know that would be at best a legal fiction. And since it would be a fiction, and since he has done a wide variety of things in both states and both years that require legal residency, it would be pretty easy for him to accidentally admit, while making excuses, to primary residency in the wrong state at the wrong time, or for an insufficient number of consecutive days for his actions to all be legal.
Not that hard. We know when the election ends. Even with a runoff the election still ends in a year he is claiming tax benefits for primary residence in Texas.
If you look at the tax rolls, half the AirBnBs in Austin have homestead, “primary residence”exemptions.
No, but we have property taxes that make up for not having a state income tax. Part of figuring the property taxes is if your home is your primary residence then you get a homestead exemption which cuts your taxes by like 20-30% (Maybe more, don’t remember off the top of my head). I think our taxes are about $12k per year and with homestead exemption they are around $9k.
I am also a Texas homeowner and no, our homestead exemption is not a flat 40K. I just looked up my property taxes and for the school district the exemption is almost 29% of the appraised value. And the exemption value is much higher than 40K. For all of the other taxes the exemption is 20%, except one which is 15%.
