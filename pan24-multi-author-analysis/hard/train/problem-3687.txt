He was charged and punished for those crimes already wasn't he? How does that make him any different from Griner who was charged and punished for domestic violence? Have either of them committed more crimes since then?
All I said is having cash should not make one a criminal, and you're talking about cops shooting civilians?
That sounds a lot like the argument Republicans make any time they want law enforcement to seize cash from an American. People travel into the United States with large sums of cash and no one automatically assumes it's for criminal activity.
It's not illegal to carry large sums of cash across state lines in the United States, although it is probably inadvisable if you have any strong attachment to that cash.

It's also beside the point. The car dealer said I couldn't get another thousand off the price last time I needed a car so I walked away until he changed his mind.
