In one country, gay marriage is legal, but trans are somehow this figure of great concern, in the other country, it's illegal to be gay and you get to be trans even if you don't want to be.
So they'll force these kids to be both not trans enough to get accepted at school, but trans enough to get beaten by the parents they're afraid to come out to.
Dunno if you know this, but some kids get beaten really really badly for less than being trans. Some parents might not take too kindly to their kid not being what they want. Even if the parents arent physically abusive, being a child or teen and being told that who you are is wrong over something you can't help is harmful. It leads them to thinking " if I can never been good enough or fixed, why should I keep living? Whats the point if no matter how hard I try I'll still be followed by these thoughts and feelings. I would be better off not being a disappointment. I would be better off dead".
Ya know what these kids need? A fucking hug and told that everything will be alright. That it's okay to feel that way and if they're so strong it's unbearable that there are ways to help.
It's a beyond incredibly dangerous slippery slope for a kid to start down on, especially with out any actual support.
