Plus what they use would be considered "subpar" even by North Vietnam in 1960s, majority of conspricts are just forced labour for the state without any training and economy on life support don't sound like something being able to keep all that tanks/planes/ships/trucks going.
There is other problem, PRC have some serious problem with North Korean illegal immigrants. If they annex North Korea they not only got a shitload of socio-economic problems but also massive refugee crisis AND Koreans not gonna accept they are part of China.
I don’t understand it because if n Korea falls and China assumes it’s territory it’s still effectively the same situation right?
Why does China care about the west, South Korea or the USA, sharing a border with China anyways? What does that potentially enable us to do that China is afraid of?
I get the feeling China doesn't actually like them though. China just needs them to exist in order to keep US troops off the Chinese border. Having to handle NK's leash is a huge burden for the Chinese government.
We can sit here and make fun of NK's lack of grasping reality. China's the one who has to actually explain things to them. It does make NK less reliant on Russia, to be sure...
NK is China's puppet, not Russia's - always has, always will be. They don't really care about what going on in Ukraine, it's just a way to take against the class enemy.
