ron doesn’t give a shit about Hunter Biden, I wish people in the media would just ask “dude, you know you don’t give a shit about Hunter Biden, we know you don’t, can’t we just talk about you doing your fucking job?”.
He went on there ready to talk shit about Hunter Biden but only the far gives a shit about that and all it actually does is underline the ridiculous corruption of the Trump administration, and he wasn't ready for that so switched gear to whine about the media, while being on fucking tv!
He doesn't actually care about what Hunter Biden did or didn't do, what he cares about is keeping that in the media cycle because "political correctness" is done, people aren't scared of terrorist right now, immigration fears are not working, they "won" on CRT and abortion and this is just the next thing to keep their supporters engaged. Republicans run on outrage and drop out when it comes to discussions about governing.
They've made about two generations of people who are disinterested in actual democracy and governance other than to keep it out of their lives as much as possible and totally invasive in their political and cultural enemies lives.
Our Democracy and Freedoms were established to combat the principles and powers of the political, religious, and greedy who seek to live at the expense of the weak, poor, and desperate members of the United States of America 🇺🇸.
We the People Party will be established to combat the principles and powers of steal, kill and destroy the fabric of the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
Rise up within and establish the We People Party once again to correct the current situation of lies, hatred, and division.
We the People have allowed politicians to conduct public democracy functions behind closed doors for to long.
