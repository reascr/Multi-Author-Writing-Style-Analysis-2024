That's not what happened here. There was a compromise to end the use of coal 2030, so the energy companies are allowed to burn that crap until then. The compromise also saved 5 towns from beeing destroyed for a even bigger mining expansion, even without the Ukraine war this would have happened. Unfortunately, a lot of russian gas needs be substituted by coal for while because what's the alternative?
I think the problem Germany has is their choice is either coal (which is dirty but they have it) or oil (which is not as dirty but they have to buy from Russia).
i was under the impression that even if Germany buys oil from someone else in the area, like Kazakhstan, it still has to go through Russian controlled pipe?
It was agreed to because of the Russia/Ukrainian war, and the anticipated effects of shutting down the Russian oil line into Germany/Europe. Accordingly it was thought Germany would need to restart some shuttered coal burning plants this winter. The plants have not been restarted - at least so far. The coal from the mine expansion is not particularly good quality (or it would have been mined long ago).
