Probably why so many counties are just sending armoured transports as well, Russia is trying to pull pressure away from the main battlegrounds by trying another invasion in the north. But now Ukraine will be well equipped, highly mobile, and even more prepared than last year.
It would explain why we have Ukraine light tanks that excel in mobility and have anti tank ability. The tow systems and radar will give Ukraine the advantage when on the defensive.
Probably showed up with satellite data of Russia's next invasion attempt after mobilizing the 300k troops. Russia has actually decided to train these troops in some form. They probably will try to invade again with this new troops in March.
I think the Pentagon is planning on the Russians running head first into the Ukrainians again. So this time the Ukrainians will have mobile anti tank weapons to go along with the javelins.
The tanks are mainly being given to Ukraine to help them take Crimea after this next wave of cannon fodder. They will recapture it while Russia recuperate their losses.
