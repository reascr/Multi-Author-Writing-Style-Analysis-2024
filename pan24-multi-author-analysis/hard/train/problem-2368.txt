Jews never went, so it wasnt a big deal. Only in the 2000s did it become a hot button issue. Jews rarely went, and were allowed inside the mosque. That changed after with the 2nd intifada.
1967 israel won the war, and unilaterally created the status quo by giving control over the mosque to jordan with some other rules, again, self imposed.
the place is like central park new york, its huge, not a lot of people except ramadan, and most people use it to get from one side of the city to the other. the mosque itself is just one part of it.
The temple mount compound is a muslim compound. It has anecdotal to 0 meaning to Jews and is used to summon up religious and nationalist tensions by politicians.
The holiest site to Judaism was destroyed and desecrated and it's estimated remains are buried deep under the mount.
OK let's destroy all the holy churches and mosques so that someone who came 3000 years after the temple was reportedly destroyed can pray. See how ridiculous this is?
For me anyway, it just looks ridiculous. There are real problems in the world. Actual wars. People hungry, you know? At some point, the world has to stop indulging this stuff. Enough already. My reaction anyway. YMMV.
