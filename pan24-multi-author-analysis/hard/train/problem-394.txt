I hope so. And then what, if Trump is still around four years later it’s gonna be a nightmare if they try again. I want someone further left, and I’m hoping it’s not Biden and it’s not Trump but someone else we’re not talking about! Idk who though.
I guess. But in the US, the Trump signs are often in front of a shack or run down house. Do you think those people know who Nikki Haley is? Or have any affinity for Pence? Trump told everyone Pence is disloyal.
This sounds awful, but I really need to go and re-watch the debates in 2016 where Trump just savagely berates the other Rs. Jeb, Carly, Marco, Ted. It was quite a sight to behold.
The current candidates who have declared or are likely to are too weak to coalesce. Nikki? No way. Pence? Total lightweight. DeSantis? Won’t join with anyone else.
That doesn’t bother a lot of blue collar white people. A large part of the US is like a third world country. Low education rates, blue collar workforce. That kind of population responds to a guy like Trump. Trump is very much like a leader from a third world country. Lots of bluster. No good ideas.
