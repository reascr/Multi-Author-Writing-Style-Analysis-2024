No he didn't. He had no stint where he opposed Russia with any reality or legitimacy. He was favoring Russia even during his campaign for presidency. There were people wearing shirts at his rallies that said stupid stuff like I'd rather be Russian than a democrat. Hillary was widely known to be tougher on Putin and Putin openly hated Hillary and favored trump.
"Trump refused to call on Russian President Vladimir Putin to stay out of the American politics and instead reasserted his desire to draw Russia and the US closer together as president.".
If you had paid attention to what he'd been saying during the campaign you'd see that was his stance all along. He never had a stint where he was tough on Russia.
I have a Russian friend who got out of Russia before the war. They've met up with their friends and family who are still in Russia in either Dubai or Doha, can't remember which. That's an option. Although, OP will likely need to pay for the family members tickets, as their bank account are likely frozen so they can't pay for tickets themselves.
