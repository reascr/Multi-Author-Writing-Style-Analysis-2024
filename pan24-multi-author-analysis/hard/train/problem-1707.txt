I think the issue here is that he believes the rest of NATO will turn a blind eye to him attacking Greece over the Mediterranean dispute in exchange for not opening Turkey's airspace or the Turkish Straits to Russia.
If Turkey attacks Greece and Greece invokes article 5 then the straight is closed, Turkish airspace is closed, and the next Turkish government will be welcomed into NATO with open arms.
So the other NATO members could trigger this clause in the charter to justify any sanctions that they levy against Turkey in the event that it attacks Greece. The question, of course, is will they be willing to do that at the risk of Turkey withdrawing from NATO?
it's not really a matter of sacrificing NATO for Greece, although I'm sure Turkey would want to push that narrative in the event. if the alliance can't be relied upon, there is no alliance. smaller countries would observe that larger ones couldn't be counted on to fulfill their defense obligations, and pull out. it would also serve to strenhen the arguments of anti-natoists that it is actually a cover for a western takeover if the larger countries in NATO started, you know, taking things over.
