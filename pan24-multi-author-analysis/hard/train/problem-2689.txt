What about framing somebody for pedophillia and propaganda only so that you can ban them. On what basis do you suppose the moral adequacy and honesty of Ukrainian intentions? Maybe they just want to destroy everything russian in their country?
It's still threatened for those who believe in the Moscow patriarchate. Why not just punish religious leaders without banning the practice of religion?
Right to practice religion is not threatened. There still is the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyiv Patriarchate, which follows the same rites, but is not subordinate to Russian aggressors.
Because of russian agression and all the lie, which comes from russia, now is the time to forbid everything russian and have only one Canonical Orthodox church in Ukraine.
Following your logic, anyone can make church and lead illegal actions against the state, and state can do nothing with, because they're hiding under the religion.
Nowadays Ukraine has two Ukrainian Ortodox Canonical churches. One of them is under Moskva, another - under Constantinople.
