They never had a conscience to begin with. At least in the past, they worked to maintain the pretense of morality. This at least kept their more radical followers from trying to say … overthrow the government, openly attempt to rig elections, or shoot up a gay nightclub.
In the past, overtly fascist candidates like Trump, MTG, etc. wouldn’t have made it through the primaries. Conversely, establishment candidates like Reagan, Bush and Dole would never get elected today.
I’m more confused why you want to paint Reagan as some compassionate moderate conservative, when he was anything but. I’m starting to think you don’t remember the 80s at all.
Yes, Reagan had the amnesty bill. He was also a hardcore racist and tried to let the gay problem solve itself by ignoring a lethal epidemic. And that’s before you get into his economic plans or foreign policy.
You’re right that social media has magnified it, and we have seen a generation or two of Newt’s coalition of crazies wick up, but I see those more as small details rather than the greater thrust. They’re the same party. Even have a lot of the same people involved. Republicans talk so much about how bad political dynasties are, but that’s exactly what their little federalist society is.
