Almost everyone, whether aware of it or not, has encountered aliens. Some of them are terrestrial, and some are extraterrestrial, and some are subterrestrial. Many people are in denial of this fact, and those are the ones to watch out for. I don't think that preparing would really make much of a difference. If the aliens are smart and they are out in the cosmos, looking for the likes of us, they probably have a decent safety protocol procedure... so it might be best to let them take the lead, and just attempt to be polite and non-offensive.
Aliens could get in touch tomorrow and we must know what to say to them, scientists have warned, as they launched a new research hub to prepare humanity for first contact.
The team warn that although there are measures in place for dealing with threats posed by asteroid impacts, there is no agreed response if a radio signal were picked up from another intelligent lifeform.
The Seti Post-Detection Hub will bring together experts from around the world to decide how to decipher methods, enact space law and anticipate societal impacts.
The University of St Andrews has joined forces with the UK SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Research Network to establish protocols and procedures if aliens are found.
