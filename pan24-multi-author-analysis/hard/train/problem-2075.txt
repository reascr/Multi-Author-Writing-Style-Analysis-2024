When running for president Romney was persistent at labeling Russia our biggest geopolitical foe. In addition to the fact that it helps contrast himself with MAGA republicans he seems to be in favor of anything that takes Russia down a peg.
I’m curious which Republicans voted in favor of Ukraine. I suspect that Collins, Murkowski, Romney and Toomey are among them, as they they sometimes have a conscience, but I’m not sure about the rest.
To respond to your last two sentences, imagine that the United States is at a crossroads. The country can prioritize fixing its economy, which is mediocre but not depression-level bad, or help Ukraine by sending funding and military equipment.
If the United States prioritizes Ukraine, the American economy will remain in less than perfect shape for a while, but at least the people of Ukraine, and by extension, Eastern European countries that Putin might invade if Ukraine falls, can resist the iron fist of Putin.
If the United States prioritizes its economy, sure, that can improve, but at the cost of the independence of a country with tens and tens of millions of people, and if Ukraine falls to Russia, Russia will enforce its laws, including the ability to illegalize political rivals and a ban on any positive depiction of homosexuality, upon Ukrainians. Basically, if Ukraine falls, Putin will presumably be ruler until he dies and Ukrainian homosexuals won't be legally allowed to express their homosexuality. Moreover, if the Russian military can conquer Ukraine easily enough, Putin will potentially decide he wants even more countries to be under Russian control, and the cycle of Russian invasions will repeat itself.
