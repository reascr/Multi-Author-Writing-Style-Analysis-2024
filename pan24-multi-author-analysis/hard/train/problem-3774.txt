It's just the Swiss opportunism in play. They've been doing this for centuries. But i think this isn't smart in the long run. Clients may just switch suppliers. The guepard uses 35mm rounds, there should be plenty of factories able to produce them.
This starts to look like a crisis. If there are no clear objetives, probably there's fighting in the high command of where they want to go. Not having a global strategy will exacerbate the lack of military cohesion. Maybe this opens new options for Ukraine either trying to create more confusion in the Russian State or more effective strategy on the frontline.
What do you think is more unnerving to Putin and the Kremlin, NATO and their allies giving Ukraine long range weapons or Ukraine developing their own? Ones that no one knew they had the ability to make or use prior to the war?
The reason they hadn't spun up production yet was that the Zelenskyy admin knew they had moles and double agents in their midst and didn't want them to tip Russia. They only started production after those agents were purged.
Its a nice conspiracy theory, and it keeps me warm at night knowing that no matter how far fetched it is, its something that the Kremlin has to consider.
