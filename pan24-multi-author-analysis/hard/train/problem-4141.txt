Though, one could argue, had Trump just disclosed his tax returns like every other President, this entire situation could have been avoided.
Also, Donald Trump didn't refuse to release his taxes. If he ran in 16 saying, "Fuck you that's none of your business," that would be refusing. He said he would and then made excuses for why he wouldn't.
You could make the argument that Congress was just helping Trump fulfill one of his campaign promises.
Vulnerable to what, exactly? Look at my taxes. I'm fucking broke but I file them every year in accordance with the law because that's what good citizens do. In this instance, the "vulnerable" are rich assholes who don't think answering to and being accountable to the public are part of public service. Every judge, every congressperson, every President who can't accept public scrutiny of their business practices should be impeached. Full stop.
"Essentially no one's tax information is really protected, as long as you cross some interest who happens to be in power at some particular point in time. Then we're all vulnerable.".
Yep. It's not too far removed from the "it's bad etiquette for employees to discuss pay amongst one another" level of horseshit.
