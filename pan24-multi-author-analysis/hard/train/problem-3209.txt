Ukraine has defended itself well with the support of Western munitions. It's most definitely not beating Russia soundly. There's a strong possibility that Russia will keep the Donbas oblast occupied in which they resolutely have far superior artillery to Ukraine. Negotiations will come at some point, so this could be the compromise made.
Long grinding war still to go. Which is why negotiations will likely happen because despite what Zelensky says the West will realise taking Donbas will involve vast resources and support.
Defending is different to winning/beating. For Ukraine to win they need to get Ukraine territory back to pre Feb 24th borders. If you look at Bahmut, Russia isn't winning there and they're putting everything into trying to take Bahmut. However Ukraine isn't pushing them back either. I think Ukraine will win as in stop further aggression but the cost will be a loss of some of their territory.
Ukraine is beating Russia soundly, and they don't have 200 F-16s at their disposal and a 110 mile strait of ocean at the Ukraine/Russia border the way Taiwan does.
Ukraine has rolled back every one of Russias advances and they're getting more money, training, and experience while Russia is losing all of its actual trained army.
