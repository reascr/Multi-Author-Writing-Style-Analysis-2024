We've already seen this in Germany. Some protesters glued themselves to an Autobahn in Berlin and this of course caused a traffic jam. Somewhere else in the city, a truck ran over a cyclist and the fire department was called to bring some rescue equipment. Way before this could have arrived in perfect conditions, the doctor coordinating the rescue decided to just move the truck, they freed the cyclist, but she died anyway.
Realistically, the protests had absolutely nothing to do with the cyclist's death. Traffic jams in Berlin are normal, the equipment was never actually needed and the cyclist probably wouldn't have survived anyway. However, the entire right wing/conservative media apparatus tried to frame this as "the protesters killed the cyclist". Complete BS, but it helped to de-legitimize the protests.
A riot on the other hand is obviously done by bad people, so you don't have to engage with the actual argument of their protest.
Just because you’re protesting doesn’t mean that you can just start being a douchebag and that the law doesn’t apply to you.
if your point is that 'people should be able to protest as long as it doesnt inconvenience you' - then you're missing the point of protests.
If the majority doesn't want to get involved / doesn't care and they find the protest disrupting then it is a good reason to disband the protest.
I think we need to stop grouping being disruptive and annoying as well as vandalising with people who simply want to protest without being disorderly. No country in the world is going to permit protesting that becomes antisocial.
