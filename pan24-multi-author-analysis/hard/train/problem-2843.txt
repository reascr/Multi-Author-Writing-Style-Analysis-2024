>What really showed the difference from old-fogy inefficiency was that with the educational speed-up of the Corpo universities, any bright lad could graduate in two years.
Comparing New College with the aforementioned is a bit unfair; the other universities are large research universities; New College was never intended to be that. It was a private liberal arts college, as you likely know, before being becoming part of USF and then breaking off on its own again. As you suggest, the college is honors based and experimental, thus necessitating a small enrollment.
Not to be argumentative here, but how exactly does this change of board--which is mostly based on ideology and not any real proven ability to grow a university--help New College in any way? Are you basically arguing that an ideological shift will lead to a larger enrollment?
Ideology shift may lead to more enrollment. Stagnant or even decking were enrollment were not really acceptable. Sometime industry outsiders do more good than harm despite their “lack” of traditional qualifications.
It’s a cool college but I find nothing out of place with politicians appointing board of Trustees. My tour left me wondering why does Florida find this? It’s cool but an extravagance maybe we don’t need and the aversion to growth (like to maybe 1500 students) seems ridiculous given our states growth in needs. New management was in order in my opinion.
