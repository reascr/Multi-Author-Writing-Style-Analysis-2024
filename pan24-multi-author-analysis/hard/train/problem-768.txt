Of course a lot of those wars were not started by the US. Protecting someone else or responding to an attack isn't really warmonger-ish.
While we're at it, in the years since the creation of communist China, they have seized territory from (and sometimes fought wars with) nearly all of their neighbors.
But I was told by Chinese redditors that American imperialism is the problem, not them, so I’m not sure why all these countries are saying they’re defending themselves against China /s.
Because in this reality right here, after China's antics at Galwan, India's anti China stance has been greater than it has ever been before. China's constant aggression towards India throw any small possibility of Indo-Chinese collaboration right out of the window. Not to mention the fact that China has been happily arming Pakistan with the latest shit they have.
Are you from an alternative reality? If so, how is stuff there? Do they still call them "French Fries"? Do they still put pineapples on pizzas over there?
