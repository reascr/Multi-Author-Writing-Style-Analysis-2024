Stats show people don't want to go work in a shitty job with management always over their shoulder, when they can get the same work done at home, in their own time, AND spend time with family, or get things done around the house.
Nah it's definitely stupidity. I mean Twitter was already slowly losing money as it was....he just came and burned the whole thing down. He thought he could run it the same way he runs all his other endeavors, but forgets this isn't science based. So nobody is going to care about clout working for one of the smartest tech geniuses of our time, because it's fucking Twitter, and they don't get paid enough for to deal with his shit.
Fuck Elon musk. He should have stuck to space X and Tesla. Dudes a GD idiot troll, and I think it's fucking hilarious he spent 44b on an already dying social media platform only to burn it to the ground in....what? Less than a month since gaining ownership of it? What a joke ðŸ¤£.
The irony. Hey can you testify? Because none of our guys have testified or responded to sub peonas that for the average citizen typically results in jail time.
