The 118th United States Congress is poised to elect a new Speaker of the House when it convenes for its first session today.
Until the vote for Speaker has concluded, the House cannot conduct any other business. Based on current reporting, neither candidate has reached majority support due to multiple members of the Republican majority .
Jeffries getting elected House Speaker, Republicans crossing the aisle to vote with Democrats on a moderate Republican, or this fiasco just continuing are all giant political wins for the MINORITY PARTY that should have no authority.
The absolute funniest way for this to end is for the gridlock to go on so long that a handful of moderate Republicans decide to vote for Jeffries just to get it over with so they can do literally anything else.
Will the right wing eco-system just attack them as RINOs or whatever slur they think is clever or will the recognize that democrats have only been gaining because they have been giving into the truly insane for the last few elections?
At this juncture the repub establishment has to decide if they will cut out the crazies and make a deal with dems or piss of their moderates and business donors by allowing the crazies to run wild. It's a wonderful lose lose for them and an ever present reminder you reap what you sow.
You can't appease crazy so I would hope they'd take the opportunity when they're here at their weakest to strike but we'll see.
