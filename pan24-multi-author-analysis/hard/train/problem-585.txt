Roberts, if you want to fix the ethics of the Court, you could start by resigning. There are a lot of reforms that should be done, but perhaps you are not thee person who should do them.
The impeachment process used to work. In the last 225 years, 15 federal judges have been impeached. According to Google:
The Chief Justice could also charge a committee of federal Appellate Court judges to enforce ethics for the Supreme Court. He could give them both the power to publish a code of Supreme Court ethics, to judge the compliance of the Justices, and to impose fines for offenses. The Catholic Church does something like this with bishops, cardinals, and the Pope. In most cases power flows from the Pope, to the Cardinals, and them down to the Bishops, but in a few cases the power to rule the Cardinals is in the hands of the Bishops, I think.
This principle does not work all that well within the Catholic Church, but it could be made to work. If it is organized by the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice could change it if his own ethics was called into question. A constitutional amendment would be a better way to handle this.
In theory, its oversight comes from the threat of a Constitutional Convention. In practice, that'll never happen though. Also, impeachment is theoretically possible.
