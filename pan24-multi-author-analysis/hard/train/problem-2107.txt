I like to flip it around. By this logic don’t higher personal income tax rates just get passed on to businesses as increased costs of labor? If I paid a higher tax rate I’d demand higher pay, but that’s not how it works, my pay is determined by the market based on location, credentials, experience, etc.
Prices are limited by what the market will pay, with considerations for cost of inputs and overhead. Income taxes are calculated after-the-fact based on net profits and have no bearing on how prices are determined.
Also just a reminder that the corporate income tax rate was nearly double what it is now back in the 50s and 60s.
There are some finer points to it, sure. And I agree theres a limit to how high you can raise taxes, someone else mentioned the Laffer Curve. But I’d argue you need a much much higher tax rate before you start to see negative consequences, def significantly higher from where US current corporate rates are at 21%.
“Don’t let anyone convince you lower corporate tax rates benefit anyone but shareholders”, lower tax rates in previous years have resulted in higher tax revenue. That’s why I mentioned the Laffer Curve.
There are curves to all these things. Every single change in something like tax rates or interest rates makes a difference in a macro sense. They are like supply/demand curves. A small change here has an effect there. Plus there are the decisions on where global corporations choose to set up shop to consider. It’s a big dynamic world out there. That’s the beauty of capitalism.
