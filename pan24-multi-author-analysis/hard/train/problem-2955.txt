But also he declassified them. Because sometimes you declassify Top Secret national secrets so that you can keep them as souvenir keepsakes, before they're planted by the FBI as part of a national archive hoax.
You want people to believe that the FBI somehow got their hands on the very documents that the National Archives later said that they did not ever receive, all for the purpose of subsequently planting them in your office (and into those folders)?
You then say that the FBI "planted" the documents into those folders, but how does that explain the National Archives many months before stating that they didn't have them, and that they never received them?
If any of what you say is true, then why didn't your lawyers offer up this simple explanation when the National Archives first wrote asking for the documents that they said that you didn't have (after all, you would have been alarmed to learn that the National Archives was saying that they didn't have the documents to the folders that you now say that you kept, while your lawyers were writing that you didn't have anything that belonged to the National Archives, correct)?
