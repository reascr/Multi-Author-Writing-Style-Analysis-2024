"For years, the standard dismissal of CPAC was that it was a fringe festival running adjacent to the modern conservative movement, the kind of scene often compared to the cantina of weirdos from the Star Wars franchise. Sure, the summit mattered, but far less than its enthusiasts wanted to think, and far, far less that its adherents had hoped. After all, this is a place where former Republican presidential nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney alike drew boos, far-afield ideas about voter fraud are treated as gospel, and Russia has an oddly enthusiastic set of defenders. In the words of one former Republican member of Congress, it is the Right’s “freak show,” one where the worst impulses of the GOP are on full display.
If current GOP politicians are not sufficiently extreme, then even more extreme politicians will emerge to take their place. That seems to be the way things are going for them.
The most extreme elements of the GOP's base have been setting the tone for years now. Whatever hateful bullshit people like Nick Fuentes are putting out there now will be GOP dogma eventually, as GOP politicians compete with each other for the right-wing vote.
A few years ago it would have been considered ridiculous for someone like MTG to ascend as far as she has. And now, here we are. She's what passes for "mainstream" among GOP politicians now. An open insurrectionist occupies a position of significant authority and responsibility. Someone who unironically calls for the breakup of the United States is helping to run the United States. It's absurd. There's no limit to how far these folks will go to win and maintain power, and no floor on how low they will sink.
