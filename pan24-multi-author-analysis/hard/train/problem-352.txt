Makes me wonder how many others are currently held there without charges, and how long have they been there? How could this go unaddressed for two decades? You'd think it would have to be a severe case of negligence on the prison's part, or even maliciousness. (I disagree with Guantanamo's existence as a space to hold prisoners without charges on principle, but in any case, holding someone for years at a time is unacceptable).
I feel sick when I think of the number of people that slip through the cracks, serving time for crimes they didn't commit, facing injustice without an end in sight.
We have a right as citizens to a speedy and public trial, and it's telling to see what our government does to those who don't have those rights guaranteed.
one would think that a democratic country would release people when they can't find proof of wrongdoing, even if detained without charge, but guess that's too high of a bar.
Yeah, sure couldn't let them go free due to breaking international law in detaining and torturing them, after all. Gotta keep them somewhere we can keep torturing them for information.
I mean, considering the ignoring of laws from the ground up (do you seriously think no international laws have been broken for Guatanamo Bay?), why wouldn't they continue the torture inside US soil. They could have used the infamous Chicago PF black site, even. Hells, up to 17 US naval vessels have been known to be used as mobile "interrogation" chambers, as well as a small handful of aircraft.
