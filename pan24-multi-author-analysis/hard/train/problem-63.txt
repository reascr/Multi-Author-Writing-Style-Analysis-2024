In germany we like to call these people, especially the ones in office, "the political arm of right wing terrorism" (original: "Der politische Arm des Rechtsterrorismus.").
Sure. But she will tweet something fascist, a few thousand might see it, then 183 news companies write an article to the effect of "omg look how crazy she is!" Then millions see what she said.
If news companies stopped reporting on every fucking thing she said, her rhetoric wouldn't have any impact on anyone.
And the dumbasses who run our media are just like "Well, she says she didn't, so clearly these things are unrelated On to the next story".
The exposure she has at speeches vs the exposure she gets from the thousands of news articles written about the stupid shit she says aren't even comparable.
The news companies who report on her batshit stupid craziness aren't the ones being read by the types of people who believe her fascist rhetoric.
Sure many of the news companies use her insanity for more clicks and revenue, but again, the qanon types aren't exactly reading vanity fair. Least people can keep track of the fascist rhetoric when it crops up and know where it came from. Better to be informed and depressingly angry at the fascists than blissful ignorance and surprised when the nazis show up at your doorstep.
