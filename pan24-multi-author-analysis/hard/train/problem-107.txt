Problem: In neighboring Guyana there was colonialism, too. After that Black and Indians subdued each other. Better? Who apologizes now.
What has happened has happened, you just need to find a way to move on and an apology is a very good first step.
But either way, an apology under any circumstance is never meant to undo anything. It’s symbolic, it’s done to acknowledge wrongdoing, to heal and to show that you’ve learnt your actions have hurt someone. An apology has never ever been able to fix the past, so I really don’t understand why you would have an issue with this.
Any apology and recognition of the mistakes of the past will make it better for the future that is being planned. Good thing that Netherlands has done it.
I hope other colonial powers(English, French, Spain and Portugal) starts apologising and returning the loot and artefacts of African, South American and south Asian countries.
And before sending any artifact back, maybe we should make sure that they aren't lynching their own people for being a different colour (looking at you South Africa), and maybe start building a developed country? Because i'm 100% sure those artifacts would just be stolen and sold to the medium bidder.
