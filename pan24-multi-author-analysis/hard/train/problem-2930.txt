I wonder how many man hours and millions that the West/5 eyes has spend on assisting Ukraine fucking up the Russians ðŸ¤” I bet any move towards Kyiv would be met with well deserved destruction and carnage.
I'm surprised and shocked at the amount of Americans and that is half of America, that support Putin and blaming Ukraine for fighting Russian and the right wing media saying that Ukraine has been killing people in the Donbas for 8 years.
Thank heavens that the sane people are leading the world and that is all those who support Ukraine, are the worlds sane people.
Hoping it doesn't of course, but I'm just making the point that even now Ukraine is still not totally safe.
Russia likely can't occupy or even reach Kiev, but Crimea is still defendable. It's probably not worth it for them and will accelerate the collapse of the Russian state, but it's still possible.
I know it sounds silly and Russia probably isnâ€™t that stupid to use a nuclear device in any capacityâ€¦ but I feel like theyâ€™re getting desperate and almost all bets are off at this stage.
I am no military expert, and I donâ€™t think this will actually happenâ€¦ but seeing the recent events that are happening is making me slightly worried that Putin is actually considering a nuclear option here.
I remember a little while back that there was an article talking about how they were training Russian troops to deal with nuclear radioactivity during combat, along with all of the recent articles of Putins nuclear posturing and now weâ€™re getting new articles of massive troop build up for an all in attack on Kyiv.
