Of course we all know what he really meant, but the burden of proof is on the prosecutors to demonstrate that he meant something different than what he said. Proving intent is a requirement for the Georgia law, so if Trump's defense can convince part of a jury that Trump really believed there were 11,780+ fraudulent/fraudulently discarded votes, then they can argue that he did not willfully pressure Raffensberger to commit election fraud, but merely to investigate it.
They are both damning cases, but the main piece of evidence is the Raffensperger call, which is an hour of smoking-gun evidence and a Secretary of State potentially testifying against him - and the GA case also involves the correspondences of John Eastman, who is central to the fake electors scheme and conspiracy charges.
But this one is open and shut, has documented criminal intent, testimony from the governor, Secretary of State, State Congress members, Trump’s own lawyers, and a dozen others - and GA state charges are particularly unfavorable for Trump’s actions.
I do think the House Committee report--and presumably the Georgia grand jury findings--has enough to convince any reasonable jury that Trump knew he was lying, and therefore knew he was pressuring Raffensberger to commit a felony. So I'm cautiously optimistic. But I can't be 100% confident about any case that rides on proving Trump believed a reasonable thing over a crazy thing.
I wouldn't want to be the prosecutor who has to prove Donald Trump didn't believe a crazy conspiracy theory.
