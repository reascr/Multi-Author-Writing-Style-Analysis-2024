Yeah, it's pretty late in the game for any major reversal on anything going into that conference. Unless there are some nations that are still "on the fence" with respect to a major decision. For example, like will Country X send Leopards or not, this type of further aggravating action by Muscovy could tip the scale. But like I say, it's late in the game even for that.
AI released a controversial report on Ukraine military setting up defence in Ukraine cities. Next day Russians were at the UN justifying their military presence in Ukraine and raised the AI report.
Given how dangerous the report is and how welcomed it was through Russia's propaganda and state news, "hardly anything" is totally unacceptable.
But Amnesty reported what they saw, it's not propaganda since Amnesty reports also Russian crimes, hiding possible violations of international laws, even tho how necessary they would be, would be more propaganda.
As in: why would you use an organization that has spreading propaganda as one of its purposes as an information source, rather than Amnesty International?
