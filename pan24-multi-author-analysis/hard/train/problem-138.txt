Well, Tom Brady is also a piece of shit in his personal life, so they have that in common. Tom Brady is a winner, though, and that's something Trump will never be.
Tom Brady is the Greatest (and “winningest”) Quarterback of all time… so, yes, Trump Jr is trying to saying he’s a “winner” with this anecdote.
But really… it’s a fitting analogy. Brady has asterisk beside damn near every win he’s ever had. He’s an overrated, proven cheater who’s gotten away with it every step of the way and never faces a single consequence… so it’s actually a very spot-on comparison.
What’s not said here, is that Brady is also the only QB to ever be officially “charged” with cheating in the NFL, amongst a slew of other cheating allegations surrounding all his other wins, along with other a parade of convenient “conveniences” that have benefitted him for his entire career.
So to sum it up… there’s a bunch of people offended that trump is comparing himself to one of “the greats”.
"Folks... Trump is like a Benedict Arnold... one of the greats, if not the greatest of Americans... many people are saying. We're looking into it strongly...".
>Mr Trump nonetheless has compared his own life to that of military veterans, including by describing his effort to avoid sexually transmitted infections whilst dating in the 1970s and 1980s as his “personal Vietnam”.
