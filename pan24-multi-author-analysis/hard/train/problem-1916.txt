Fun fact! The purchase, possession, and consumption of cannabis in a public place in Spain is only a misdemeanour. you can get a fine and/or have it taken away. No criminal penalties. But you can legally grow your own and smoke your own in private as long as you're not growing it for sale. And in a lot of areas it's very tolerated and cops won't do shit even if you're smoking in public.
Most people will certainly care, they just won't tell you if they see you smoking in public unless its a closed space and you are disturbing them. But they will for sure avoid you, because as much as people defends It smoking in public spaces its still annoying, both for tobacco and weed smokers, but weed smells way more.
Well regardless of everything you mentioned which i have no idea if true, the act of smoking weed similarly to smoking tobacco severely harm your lungs in the long run because for obvious reasons. (And if they are not obvious to someone, you are free to read about damages of smoking and inhaling smoke as well as passive smoking).
I have absolutely no problem with legalization as long as smoking weed and cigarettes would have a very strict control so people won't smoke in your face all the time.
Tobacco is obviously nocive, but that doesnt make marijuana good. Its not that harmful to your own organism, but "less than x" doesnt mean its totally harmless. Also while It won't kill you by smoking It its still detrimental to society.
I agree that weed should be legalized, however I'm also tired with the most pro-weed addicts bullshit that weed doesn't harm. I've seen people lose most of their brain and turn permanently stupid for smoking weed for only two years, so don't whitewash it as if it wasn't generally bad for health. And societies like the Netherlands or St Francisco where too many people are high are not really a good model to imitate.
