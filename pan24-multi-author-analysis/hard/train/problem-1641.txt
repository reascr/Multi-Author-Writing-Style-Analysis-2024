Double actions revolvers are not semi-automatic. Semi-automatic means that the firing mechanism uses some energy to load/chamber the next round; in revolvers that is controlled completely by the trigger pull itself. Basically they lack the automatic part of semi-automatic, so they are just repeating firearms.
This isn't really about AKs and the article is adding that bit in. This is just a change from handgun to firearm. So a folding single shot shotgun in a backpack is now legal (good for transporting). It also would cover a shotgun in a car, which can be considered concealed in some places. I think the more likely thing is hunting guns, but for people walking around with different guns it would probably be firearms like the Shockwave carried in a bag/backpack.
How can you not comprehend the difference between someone carrying a holstered weapon and someone pointing one at someone? they dont look anything alike.
The idea that someone could be permitted to legally carry their lawfully owned handgun but somehow is commiting a crime by carrying their lawfully owned rifle in the same peaceful manner is egregious and insane.
yeah like they are making this out to be some extreme thing but if the state has permitted me to carry a handgun, what difference does it make if I have a carbine in my backpack?
Im not familiar with TN laws, but here in PA having a firearm loaded or capable of being loaded in a vehicle counts as concealed carry. Without a LTCF the ammunition or firearm has to be stored where the driver does not have access. With an LTCF they can be loaded, including pistol AK variants.
The bill does not mention the AK47, it changes the text of current conceal carry laws from "Handguns" to "Firearms". That is all. The comment about the AK47 was added by someone else as a way to scare people and drive up engagement.
