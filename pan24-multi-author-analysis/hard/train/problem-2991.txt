Make it easier - there are already rest stops all over the place. The ones I'm familiar with in the Midwest have restrooms, a little area with some picnic tables, plenty of parking, vending machines, and some even have wifi. Add chargers to those and get a head start, plus they're already placed at distances convenient for, ya know, taking a rest.
Not really, charging stations are much cheaper and easier to build and maintain. Electric roads are much less efficient, significantly more expensive to build, way worse to maintain (we already have issues with normal asphalt road maintenance), and their real world practicality is dubious at best and is more likely to end up being nonfeasible and a failure than a success, much like the solar roadway fad.
That's not even getting into how ridiculously expensive it is to maintain roadways, especially highways, compared to how many people they serve or the fact we could easily replace lanes of highway with rail lines and it would be perfectly reasonable to do so where the track can reasonably be placed.
You're just not really understanding how insanely expensive that would be for dozens of 50k person towns where 200 people would use it and the routes would need to cover hundreds of road miles to even begin to replace cars.
