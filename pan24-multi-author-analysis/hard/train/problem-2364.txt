Yeah, Trumped was divisive. He pissed people off. But he also had a ton of support. It's even more impressive when you consider that he was against Hillary the first election, then Biden the second (and Biden is going to drum up far less GOP opposition - even though there were attempts to smear Biden he's just not going to rally the GOP against him).
There weren't 10 million new voters, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that even if you think that every 18 year old and migrant who got gained citizenship voted for him it STILL doesn't come close to explaining all the votes he got.
He can't have pissed off his base that much, as so many of them voted for him (more than Obama's base in Obama's best year). But yeah, he pissed off the democrats enough for them to bother voting.
Use a little common sense. It's not explained by population growth, because the population didn't grow by 11 million. It's TOTALLY disingenuous to say that 4 years population growth is anywhere near comparable to 50 years of population growth (your example I think?).
Pff. Ukraine will control all major Ukrainian cities by September 2023. If they have not fully forced Russia out by then. That's way too far in the future for Putin to be so cocky.
