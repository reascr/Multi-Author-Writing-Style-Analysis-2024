This is why I roll my eyes when everyone rehabs Cassidy Hutchinson. She knew who she was siding with, I don't care if she rolled over when it finally got into her head that there might be consequences.
Lots of women and other minorities take advantage of opportunities to gain wealth and power in a capitalist country which undermines them without becoming part of the machine that tries to oppress women and minorities.
I think that what people like yourself don’t grasp about being an undermined minority in a capitalist system, like ours, is that such minorities are not responsible, at least not to the same standards as wealthy, white, heterosexual-passing men, for what they have to do to make ends meet, which equates in said system with getting ahead. It’s the luck of the draw for such minorities. So, I think that’s her excuse, which I personally will allow since she has made recent strides in a more ethical direction with her brave testimony. I agree with you, it is a tragic waste of human potential—living within the capitalist death grip, as such.
Not saying she wasn’t misguided or even knowingly acting on poor ethics, just adding some actual, grounded, nuance to this.
