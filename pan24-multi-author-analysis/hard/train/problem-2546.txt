I never supported Trump or voted for him. I think the Russia investigation was a complete witch hunt and waste of time and money. Our money. Also, Jan 6th was a disgusting event. I know everyone would prefer to believe that Trump orchestrated it to attempt a takeover of govt but how I’m not sure how true that is. I think that we will find that we don’t have enough evidence to prove that and then nothing more will come of it.
The media does nothing except blindly support these stupid half assed investigations launched with poor evidence. They lead us on in order to get views and traffic. Who wouldn’t want to see Trump in prison?
Yes I am against a stupid investigation to Hunter Biden’s laptop. And yes I’ve listened to the hearings. What damning evidence is there against Trump? I’m not saying he’s innocent. I’m just saying that I don’t really think there’s strong evidence to convict him of something.
I don’t buy this theory. It seems more likely she’s going to pretend that she was never involved in the first place. Distance herself for six months to a year and then act like every corrupt act, every horrible decision she made, etc..just simply never happened. Like an abusive partner that is incredulous that you would even think about accusing them of something they did in the past.
