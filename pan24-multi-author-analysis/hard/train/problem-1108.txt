If he could start all over, it would be very easy: The Chinese pharma company Fosun invested very early in Biontech and signed deals with Biontech, similar to Pfizer, allowing them to sell it in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The US had no problem to act like Pfizer is an American vaccine. China could have called it Fosun and do the same. In Hong Kong Fosun actually sold the Fosun Biontech vaccine. But only in Hong Kong. It worked, of course. But not for the rest of China. Why?
Why does this matter though? China is running a no COVID policy. It's not like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines make you immune to the virus. If it was he probably would. Even if they accepted Western vaccines, it wouldn't change anything about the current situation in China.
NOTE; Im not supporting Xi decision to reject western vaccines... just adding a side note to a possible reason many in china refuse to take a western medicine.
Why is everyone up and down in this thread not having even read the article, China was never offered western vaccines - it's just some American dork claiming they never asked. Not to mention the line "some studies have shown Chinese vaccines aren't as effective as Western ones" what studies? What actual link? Here's a hint, near every study shows that pfizer/moderna/chinas vaccines all have similar efficacy rates after multiple doses which near all of china already has, so what's the point in suddenly paying through the nose for something that's just as effective?
Also let's completely ignore that western and chinese vaccines both have similarly efficacy rates after multiple doses(which near everyone has at this point).
