I view it as a sign of progress that we've gone from that basically not being even a blip on the radar to him being removed from a lot of newspapers over that kind of speech.
Back in... I think it was 2011, Adams posted a blog post that was pretty close to this about women, comparing equal pay for women to children wanting candy. He ended up deleting it after critique, but in tone and intent it was pretty close. Real class act, Mr. Adams.
That revealed to me a lot about Adams. Enough to put him into the "racist asshole" bucket alongside trump.
My recollection from 2016 is that Adams expressed admiration for trump's ability to manipulate people and at no time condemned trump for his racist statements.
Adams decided he was also a "Master Manipulator" so dove head long into Trumpism as it vindicated how he saw himself - as powerful and important as Trump.
That's a point I have to agree, and explains much of his success that he has 0 concern for logic, truth or constantly since none of that matters.
Yup, his school of thought is that so long as you he gets a reaction, he has "maniplauted" you and is in control.
