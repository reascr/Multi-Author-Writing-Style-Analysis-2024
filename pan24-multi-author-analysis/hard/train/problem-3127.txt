If the electricity company can supply 10 electricity and buyers demand 5, they can drop the price to encourage more buyers into the market or existing buyers to increase their demand. Either way, they want to sell their electricity.
If the electricity company can supply 10 electricity and buyers demand 15, they increase the price of the 10 until some buyers are priced out and they get the best price possible for their 10 electricity.
When UK were negotiating for the building of new nuclear power station projects, they guaranteed that they could sell their electricity at I think 3 or 4 times the then price of electricity. So all the other energy producers work to raise theirs to match yes?
Ideally we should be reducing the energy price so high cost dirty production is priced out. But no, we raise the price to accommodate.
The price is not cost plus, but is a market price. That 5 year old wind turbine is still generating energy, but its electricity is sold higher now. Garnering more profit for its owner. Simply putting in lots of wind turbines will not reduce the cost of energy. It'll just be more profitable than building a nuke power plant and selling energy at the same high price.
