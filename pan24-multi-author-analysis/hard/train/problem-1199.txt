“FoxNews.com” should not be pointing out anything to do with lies. I can already feel the ridiculous bias coming from this article without opening it.
And It does not have anything in it that is extremely biased or inaccurate. People seem to be just taking issue with the source being 'Fox News,' and the fact that it is critical of Biden.
I can not remember the last time I read a Fox News article, but I just read it because no where in the comments does any one mention what is actually in the article.
Because the infrastructure jobs are public private partnerships the jobs are going to be going over budget, hit with delays, lack of transparency, and the workers will likely not be from the local communities...the contractors will not be sub contracted out under the authority of a local state department of transportation but likely have ownership, or lease on the road, bridge, infrastructure. Private sector objective is profit. This will result in increased costs, being subjected on residents without the benefit of increased availability of jobs. As a result when the Federal money dries up the work stops, and national infrastructure is as it was before...Failing.
