Expanding the court is packing the court. It was extremely controversial the last time it was tried, to the point where it made FDR a lame duck domestically for the rest of his presidency. It hasn't been tried and actually done in over a century and would be an extreme violation of institutional norms. Democrats need to be trying to lower the temperature, not doing extreme brinkmanship like that.
At this point, "abortion rights being up to the states" is the new status quo, and I doubt voters will actually start voting hard enough to change it.
It's more referring to the fact that every ballot measure on abortion went in favor of women's rights to choose, even in deep red states. It's not talking about the Senate votes. People still voted for Republicans while voting against abortion bans and pro-life nonsense.
What the right failed to realize is that anti-abortion is a fringe position. It has been for decades. But this extreme minority view has been such a huge part of their platform that theyâ€™ve believed it was much more popular than it is.
