Added to this, for whatever godforsaken reason, my LGBT close friend was being unironically asked by people why some gay people were interested in monkeys.
"If you get monkeypox from having sex with monkeys and only gay people are spreading it, then what else could it mean?".
I wish I could say this was sarcasm or a joke, but it was an actual conversation. My friend is a bartender and it has happened four times. Four times. Evidently stupid still is as stupid does.
This is stupid logic. The fact of the matter is that they changed the name because it's already problematic. This wasn't a preemption, like you believe. Racists were already going "sounds like something only blacks get". The point isn't to satisfy racists, it's to take away the association that people are already making.
They’re not changing it because they think it might have racist connotations, they’re changing it because they’ve actually seen it happening.
People use the name to be racist, those being defamed due to the name rightfully asked to have it changed. Same thing when they changed the covid variant names because the names sounded too political. There's literally NO upside to saying "Well but we already named it that way and we don't care about what issues it causes".
