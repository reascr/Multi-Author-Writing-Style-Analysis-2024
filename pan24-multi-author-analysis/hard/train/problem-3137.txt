The internet initially started as military project called ARPANET, basically a way for military to talk to eachother. That then grew and morphed into what we know today.
We knew what it would become. We didn't know how capitalism would so quickly turn it into a handful of sites.
, in the earliest days of the web, talking about how it's already inevitable, and how the internet had been used for commercial purposes from very early days.
The internet in it's current form has existed since the 60s, the world wide web didn't exist until the 90s.
If you wanna move your goalposts to "dialing a BBS in the 80s wasn't the internet" you can go ahead and move those goalposts. That's a different argument.
It's an incredibly ignorant view to conflate the two. And I mean ignorant literally, I'm not trying to put you down. You're just unaware.
I may only be 3 years older than the WWW, but that's enough for me to know I'm right, and you name dropping ARPANET incorrectly and writing out hypertext transfer protocol instead of HTTP don't give you any more authority.
