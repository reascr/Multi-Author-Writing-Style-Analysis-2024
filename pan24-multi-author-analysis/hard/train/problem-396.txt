Hopefully the Strykers/LAV's (and similar) will help with that strategy. Russia doesn't really have anything comparable, as their BMP fleet has proven to be incapable of safely mobilizing their infantry.
If the ammo is in a useable state they still have to get it to the frontlines which seems to be a problem with all the incompetence in the Russian army.
Even if you go back to the very beginning when Russian equipment was at its best and Ukraine didn’t have the defense forces they do now; there were columns of burning vehicles.
The war we are seeing in Ukraine is between 2 relatively equal opponents. They’re relatively equal because neither side has definitive air superiority; if that wasn’t the case…this war would probably already be over (over with a lot of partisanship if Russia had won so not really a win).
The military world Patton lived in was closer to world war 1 than it is to modern conflicts (both in terms of time, strategy, and the scale of forces at play in the war being fought) he cannot/should not be used as first reference point when deciding military strategy in modern conflicts.
Tanks are sitting ducks whether they’re moving or not when air superiority isn’t clearly in your favor. Air superiority dictates the ability to do large scale artillery and when it is completely in one sides favor; allows for the rapid mobilization and pivoting of ground forces.
