Everyone is acting like it’s just stupid for North Korea to test these weapons, but what they are trying to do is normalize the tests, such that the world eventually accepts North Korea as a nuclear power. Everyone has seen what Russias nuclear weapons have done for it. NATO would probably be all up in their shit if it weren’t for their nuclear capabilities. Other countries want those assurances, like North Korea, so they will try to become accepted nuclear powers like Russia.
The Russians and the North Koreans just like to scare people with their nuclear weapons. Putin is doing it to basically say hey stop giving Ukraine weapons and let me destroy my neighbour and Rocket man is just doing it purely for attention going “hey everyone I’ve got missiles and nukes to Please be afraid of me”.
I think they’re actually just idiots wasting what Putin gave them in exchange for those artillery shells that literally every intelligence agency on Earth saw N.Korea give the Russians (via giant damn trains), but which they both deny ever happened.
Putin has probably been giving him the rockets to distract from Ukraine too, this is why he’s stoking a fire in Serbia-Kosovo too. He thinks he’s smart, but no one gives a toss about N.Korea, the annoying Chihuahua of the world.
