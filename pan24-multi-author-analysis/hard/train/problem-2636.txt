I am not feeling it. Every WC or Euro we make plans with friends, get together to watch games, bbqs outside. Now that it's in winter I am not even sure if we will get together for the final. I probably won't watch a game and I've watched most WC games for decades. Feels like it will be a complete skip.
That's the point, no one is hyped. No one cares really. We usually talk and discuss the upcoming world cup. Make bets about winners and teams that go out early. It's complete silence now. Like there is no event at all. Feels like everyone will just skip it.
I honestly doubt you would actually skip it. I mean if you even remotely follow football, you’ll eventually be overwhelmed and give in because everyone’s gonna be hyped and talking about it. You’re seriously gonna miss it because it’s winter? I understand trying to stand up against corruption but it’s futile in this case.
This World Cup is probably gonna be immortalized as it’s the last of the two goats and if Argentina actually wins this year, probably gonna be one of the most famous world cups ever. The World Cup is projected to be watched by 5 billion people. People are definitely excited.
At the end of the day, people don’t really care about this shit otherwise Fifa would’ve died years ago. No cares if it’s corrupt as long as they provide entertainment to fans.
