Barr straight up lied that trumps status as president had nothing to do with the decision not to refer for prosecution, the Mueller report explicitly states that it did in fact did.
And the fucks made it all go away by making Mueller testify and asking him whether or not Trump was guilty and he said repeatedly that it wasn’t his determination to make but that the evidence was right there in the report.
Seriously underestimating the group of people who still to this day insist that Mueller totally exonerated Trump of all wrongdoing and declared that “Russian collusion was a hoax.”.
Not sure, but does it matter? It’s not as if the alt-right trash will acknowledge it- it would mean they’d have to stop playing dumb. I promise, there’s literally nobody in that camp for whom evidence of anything matters.
We've already seen the evidence. We watched it happen live. He keeps admitting to committing crimes. Stop pussyfooting around it and arrest the fucker already.
No shit Sherlock, there's obviously a process. Nobody is expecting Adam Schiff to go over to Mar a Lago with handcuffs.
