Some geopolitical experts at the turn of the century had predicted that during the first half of this century Poland would supplant Germany in terms of strategic importance in the eyes of the US due to its closer proximity to NATOs eastern border.
The buying spree comes as Poland attempts to solidify a position as a leading pillar of European relations with the United States, with the war in Ukraine shifting the balance of political power in Europe further to the east. That was hammered home this week as Biden — who has yet to visit Paris or Berlin during his term —  since the war began.
Knowing my country arms history - we will probably come up with some sort of upgraded South Korean tank in future, like we did with PT91 Twardy or like we did it with assault rifle Beryl, where we took old soviet concept and made it different/better/up to NATO standards.
We are getting SEPv3 variant. No idea if it's the one you're talking about. Would need to look up the details. As far as I know - it's the most modern version of M1A2 but I am not an expert.
AFAIK - US is bringing heavy equipment and leaving it here, somewhere in Poland, to wait for bad times. Then, if shit hits the fan, it will be only about sending personel to operate all the hardware which is already here in "battle ready" state. Let's hope that it will never come down this path...
