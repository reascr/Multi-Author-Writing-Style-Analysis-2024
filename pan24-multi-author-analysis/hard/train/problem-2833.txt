There's no reason for the dems to stop laughing at the ineptitude. If reasonable moderate republicans exist and are tired of looking like a joke, they can come crawling to the democrats. No reason for the democrats to come in and save republicans for themselves.
The Democrats would be fools to trust the Republicans on meeting in the middle. If the aftermath of January 6 hasn't shown them that the Republicans will lie about this every time, then we are doomed. They need to insist Republicans take irrevocable action first, then they can compromise.
What guarantee would Democrats have that McCarthy or another Republican would actually follow through on the agreement?
The trouble is that McCarthy doesn't have the cache among his peers that a Pelosi, Boehner, McConnell, Schumer, or Frist had, so there's no reason for Democrats to trust anything he'd agree to would hold up.
It would also require McCarthy to care about doing good for the people of the United States, which is unfortunately not a requisite for the position.
