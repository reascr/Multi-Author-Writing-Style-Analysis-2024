The National Archive formally notified Trump of the Documents and multiple requests were made for their return. There is zero plausible deniability in Trump's case. Trump knew he had the documents and willfully refused to cooperate with the law.
Having documents isn't the crime Trump is accused of. Refusing to return documents and obstructing efforts to retrieve documents is the crime Trump is accused of.
Correct, it is the willful retention of the documents that makes Trump's actions criminal. The National Archive formally requested the documents back and Trump refused.
Biden's lawyers notified DOJ and the National Archive about his documents and preemptively returned them without any official request ever needing to be made.
In Biden's case (from the reports that we currently have), they found the documents, notified the proper agencies, and transferred them ASAP. In Trump's case, he lied about having them, refused to turn them over, and has repeatedly fought to have the government turn the classified documents back over to him calling them his property. That shows much more intent than "someone made a mistake, here are these documents back.".
