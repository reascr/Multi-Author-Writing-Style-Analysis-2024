Imagine having to support a billion different versions of the architecture made by a billion different people/organizations. Good luck getting unified OS's like Android and iOS to work on a billion different instruction set architectures.
Without IP protection, any person would be able to copy and modify the ARM architecture as they wanted to.
IP protection should not be awarded for public research grants, but if someone privately funded a new innovation, they deserve to make money off of it.
Most of the major technological breakthroughs of the past half century were from public funding. This includes most medical research (yet pharma companies keep the profits), GPS, the internet, telecommunications, space travel (SpaceX didn’t invent anything), etc. hell, the Covid vaccine was developed with mostly public and donated money. It’s a life saving treatment, it shouldn’t have been patented but the plans should have been given for free to all countries who could produce it. The IP can be copied for free anyways, why withhold free medical info from countries just because they’re poor?
Lastly, removing IP laws would actually improve innovation. All ideas are copied, inspired, and built off of other peoples ideas. IP laws give temporary monopolies to individual companies, which leads to parallel development of the same thing (waste of time), and slower innovation.
