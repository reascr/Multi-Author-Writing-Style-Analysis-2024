Not separate - They just voted 221-207 (3 R joining all D) to pass . It orders the clerk to amend the leave-less resolution to instead have 7 days paid leave. That is what will go to the Senate. .
Right. Railway workers are basically slaves if this comes to pass. They literally cannot NOT work. "Oh sure, we treat them well, of course." says the railway corporations. Except the quality of life stuff is exactly why the workers want to strike!

Why would the railroads ever bargain in good faith again? Now they know that Congress will always step in to protect their profits.
