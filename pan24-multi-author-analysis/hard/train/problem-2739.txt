Agree. This was a significant unforced error on Biden's part, one that he knew better than to commit, but I can't see myself ever voting for a candidate from the insurrection-embracing Trump party in the future.
It's not a difficult decision for us, but we have to recognize that non political, undecided, or ignorant voters might be inclined to think it's the same thing or that Bidens case is even worse for whatever stupid reason. This is going to hurt Bidens reelection chances if only because the GOP is better at weaponizing things like this and their voters and many undecideds will eat it up.
If that were true then Dems would have done a lot worse at midterms and independents would believe the big lie-- but that's not the case, so you need to accept that some GOP narratives go further than others.
But when theres a very clear kernal of truth to allegations like these we're seeing with Biden, those people will listen to conservative narratives and equate this with Trump-- or they'll just do so because it's the simplistic conclusion to draw. Believe it or not, there are candidates that the GOP smear machine actually struggle with getting something to stick with so-called independents. I don't think it's necessarily related to progressiveness, although I think moderate Dems tend to struggle here more-- it has to be someone charismatic and not establishment with decades of mistakes to bring up, and someone who really inspires the base, which are all factors that tend to benefit progressives. Obama in 2008 (not remarkably progressive) is a great example-- the opposition to him among racists and Republicans was vitriolic, but he captured the interest of the non political while inspiring his base. Biden, for whatever strenhs he has, does not have the ability to control a public narrative.
