Cuban missile Crisis notably. Under Trudeau Sr. Canada was one of if not THE first western country to form relations with Communist China. Canada despite the US embargo on Cuba, was personal friends with Castro and made many visits to Cuba as well as friendly relations between the two country. In 2003, PM Jean Chretien did not participate in the Iraq War despite pressure from Washinon. Need I go on?
Fucking America. Canada honours the extraditions, tanks Sino-Canadian relations and we get two of our own citizens kidnapped by the CCP and the Huawei bitch gets off? Tf man. “USA is best ally of Canada” my ass. Time to add that to the list of reasons I hate Biden and the USA. It was literally for nothing except the whims of a deranged Cheeto.
Sure, but this is no way to treat you allies. The US lost very little here. Canada took the brunt of it. Those two Michaels that got kidnapped? Were CANADIAN. China kidnapped our citizens in response for a decision made at the whim of some deranged Cheeto in the White House.
Good Lord, this is one of the worst fucking abuses of an ally. Apologies Americans, but Trump really fucked us over here.
Nah, there's no need to apologize to Americans all the time. They don't have the excuse of living under an authoritarian regime like Russia or China. The fuckers willingly elected a moron that used Canada like a whore.
