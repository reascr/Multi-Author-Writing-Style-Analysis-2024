Just to give actual reasonable timelines instead of the typical empty cynicism in all of these threads:
Fani Willis (Fulton DA) hinted at a , but I could see it being pushed back another a month or two. But, there aren't a lot of stones left to uncover in that one - The grand jury has basically exhausted their depositional phase, having received testimony from , including the governor, AG, secretary of state, senators, reps, and more.
These are moving fast, all things considered in our glacial legal system. Trump will 100% get indicted. Unfortunately, that's only the beginning. A trial could extend for years to come, and it's still possible he would never be incarcerated or even convicted. There's a long ways to go in any scenario.
You're not thinking far enough in to the future. Legal precedent needs to be set so that someone who comes long after the stench of 45 has faded from public memory (like the first ) has no potential avenue to try and become a dictator.
Now with that in mind, think about how long it would take to get to the point of charging an ex president for the most high profile criminal case the United States has ever seen.
At the end of the day, assuming Trump is found guilty, this is one of the single most, if not the most important cases in American history.
It helps to think about it as not prosecuting Donald Trump, but prosecuting the United States itself.
