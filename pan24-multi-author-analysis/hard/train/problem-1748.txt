Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić is concerned about tensions rising in Kosovo between the authorities there and ethnic Serbs. Apparently, ethnic Serbs set up road blocks after Kosovan police were deployed in a dispute over car number plates and things got even more heated when a stun grenade was thrown at EU police. Serbia refuses to recognize Kosovo as an independent state, so it's no surprise that tensions are high.
If territorial integrity of a country matters then Kosovo should have remained part of Serbia. If it doesn't then the people of Donbass have just as much right as the Kosovans to self determination.
I'm not trying to troll or start a fight. I simply don't see a distinction other than that the West supports Kosovo over Serbia and Ukraine over Donbass.
How so? Kosovo was a part of Serbia inhabited by an ethnic minority. Just like Donbass is to Ukraine. The people of Kosovo wanted independence so a larger power began bombing Serbia.
The people of Kosovo wanted independence, but their desires weren't taken seriously by anyone until Serbia started killing and displacing them. That is the justification of their independence, not their ethnic background. And even then, Kosovo had to wait over a decade after said killings to see if relations would normalize before getting the international backing to do it.
If there is ample evidence that Ukraine was performing similar levels of mass killing and displacement to Russians in the Donbas, then we can have a discussion about how justified it is. But right everything points to the only aggressive party being the same one that's been stirring shit there since 2014: Russia.
