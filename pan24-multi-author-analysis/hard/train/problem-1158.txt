Modern day Germany is different than its predecessor, and they’ve made it clear internationally and themselves.
Because its true? Japan was incredibly brutal, to the point where some Nazi's said that they went to far, look up any Japanese warcrime and you would be shocked and appauled.
That’s not the case for the Japanese GOVERNMENT, who refuses to teach their students of their past and is extremely lenient on the topic of their involvement in World War Two and prior, to the point where they celebrate it. the Japanese government is full of descendants of the same officials who plotted the attacks of Pearl Harbor and the terror against Asian civilians.
The arrogant culture of the Japanese elites led to its aggressive attacks on the United States bringing the US into WWII. There is no reason to believe that Japan would not fall into the same trap a second time if it were to re-arm. The victims will be the citizens of Japan. It is up the US to defend the aggressor nations of WWII because allowing them to develop offensive capabilities is a recipe for disaster. Japan is still a fiercely proud culture and that is the heart of the problem.
