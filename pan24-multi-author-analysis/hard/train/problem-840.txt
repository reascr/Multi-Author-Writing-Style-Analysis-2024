That’s actually something slightly different, that’s the “returning soldier syndrome” and that pertains to total number of children born after the time of war, ie increased numbers all around, compared to just an increase in boys being born.
Returning soldier syndrome is actually slightly different if I’m mistaken, what I saw it was talking about taller soldiers more likely to return from war, more likely to have a taller partner, and therefore have better chances to pump out 8-12 children.
I listened to an article about this that brought up some interesting correlations between the height of the returning soldiers, " more tall soldiers survived than short ones." And that tall men have a statistically higher percentage of male children versus shorter males.
I've heard a little about it and it seems like a lot of small factors adding up like taller men have an edge in physical combat and are slightly more likely to survive and taller men have more boys.
I was actually referencing a generalization of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis that taller parents have a higher ratio of sons than daughters because it is a highly heritable trait that increases male reproductive success and not female. When you include that taller parents have more children in general, you can hypothesize that you will increase the rate of tall sons.
