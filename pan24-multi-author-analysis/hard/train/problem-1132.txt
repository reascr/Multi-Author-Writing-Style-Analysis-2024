It would have helped if they vaccinated their population with some actual relevant vaccines during that time they were holding infections back, but they're so distrustful they'd rather use their outdated crappy sinovac vaccines that stopped being effective enough a long time ago.
I'm not going to tempt fate by suggesting that it's a different story now with the virus still in circulation in the rest of the world, and most people having been vaccinated and boosted.
Instead, I'll go way out on a limb and confidently predict that the State Department doesn't even update any of its travel restrictions for arrivals by air from China by the 8th. In hopes of spurring some action to prove me wrong. It definitely won't happen this week. Definitely not.
TP shortages, working from home, staycations. And on the other side of it all, bidets are still not a thing in most households.
Clearly hoping for a repeat of last time the higher-ups in Beijing decided, "it shouldn't be just us dealing with this.".
Yeah. It would take an uncomfortable amount of draconian policy to be set. But honestly it’s not only cutting off travel to and from China, but also any travelers who’s final destination, and originating location is China. And then not to mention all the other countries following suit.
