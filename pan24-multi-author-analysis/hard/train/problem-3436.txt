Kadyrov won't do it because Russian backing is the thing keeping him in power. Plenty of Chechens who'd love to rip their country out of the Kadyrovite's hands.
Kadyrov is putin's puppet in chechnya and he used the ukraine war as a showroom of military power against any chechens who wish to declear independence from russia.
I think the article refers to instability in Chechnya, not Kadyrov somehow obtaining control over whole of Russia. Whatever Kadyrov is, he doesn't simply have the resources to be as evil as Putin.
Kadyrov has been "loyal" to Russia but I have no doubt that it is almost entirely self preservation, and he'd turn on them in a second if it could somehow work for him.
I guess the question is, as Russia loses power, could Kadyrov decide at some point that he's better off turning on Russia and trying to spin that into support from Ukraine and/or it's allies. Seems like a huge long shot, both that he would turn and that he would be trusted at this point by anyone if he did. But if he were to present the right opportunity to NATO I suppose it's not entirely out of the question.
But that said, I don't see that as a very likely outcome. Mostly I doubt Kadyrov could provide Intel of the quality that would actually allow a deal to occur.
