It completely ignores the population of people who WOULD want this. Yea it's a smaller minority than people who fall into the binary. That's just a given. It's their decision that those peoples identities aren't represented enough to matter that's the issue.
Because the government doesnâ€™t care what you identify as because the only person who cares what you identify as is you.
Seems pretty neutral to me to stick with biological gender assignments and not caving to identity politics.
Look at it this way: cisgender people have the ability to have their legal gender reflect their gender identity. Nonbinary people currently do not. This outcome isn't the end of the world, but it does reflect disappointing yet unsurprising attitudes towards trans people.
Having a legal third gender won't erase bigotry, but an unacceptable social climate leads to leaving nonbinary people out.
NO, America is the only country that has ever had racism or sexism or homophobia. America is the WORST.
But I always felt that the "we're REALLY queer, get used to it" message, including the inclusion of fetishes/kinks (leather/bondage/S&M/drag) into the public image was actively counterproductive to the acceptance movement (and I think we're seeing that today). Too many people have the impression that being gay involves publicly flaunting fetishes, and that's both incorrect AND destructive to the cause.
But absolutely, systemic and overt racism is real and DOES need to be discussed. It's just... problematic to try to start to shape society around race. The noble argument of "we need to go FAR beyond 'color-blind' to fix historic injustice" has justifiably wholesome roots, but I believe it is going to shoot us in the face and make racism way worse, ending up causing more problems than it fixes.
