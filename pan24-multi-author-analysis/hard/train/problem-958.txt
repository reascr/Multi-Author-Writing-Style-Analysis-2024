Correct but a lot of that goes into its own domestic consumption. But there will always be buyers for ore and pig iron. America for example runs at 80% capacity in its steel production. And you will find similar numbers around the world. Building a new steelmill and foundries can at best, assuming no red tape and environmental as well as local concerns are disregarded, take between 3 to 6 years to construct.
What really poses a problem is the scale ie. workers that China possesses in it’s manufacturing base and the systems and supply chains that are build around it, which no other country can compete with.
That is without taking into account the time and cost of moving factories away from China (which is easily a multi year process) and the fact that find still produces many of the raw materials needs in the factories to make products.
It’s much worse to lose your customers than it is to lose your supplier since it’s much easier to replace the supplier - as we are now seeing with Western companies moving production to Vietnam, India, Mexico, etc.
