“Crackpot ideas sometimes turn out to be true.The earth does revolve around the sun, and it was Hunter Biden, not Russian disinformation agents, who dropped off a laptop full of incriminating evidence at a repair shop in Delaware. Galileo spent his remaining days under house arrest for spreading heretical ideas, and thousands of dissidents today are arrested or killed by despotic governments eager to suppress ideas they disapprove of. But this is not the American way.” - November 14, 2022.
The message was simply "The Democrats are really the bad guys. Everything a Republican does is terrific and good or acceptable or, at least, excusable.".
Gov. Abbott says he will "fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.".
Yup. Dark Brandon can go shake Abbots hands on TV and proclaim that effective immediately, the fed will bring the hammer down on anyone in TX facilitating or supporting illegal immigration. Then with extreme prejudice they should go after every single employer Of illegal immigrants. Maximum fines, jail where it fits. And every time there is a big sting that cripples a business or industry, the feds ahold applaud abbot on his stalwart stand against illegal immigration. When construction companies and hospitality and landscaping and any others that are habitual abusers of illegal labor are shutting down in lieu of paying actual wages to Texans, they can turn against Abbot, especially with a dem candidate announcing reforms to help bring more labor force into the state.
I imagine the foreign power thing will be arms purchases for his border security force from Russia. They need a buyer, and these days the Repubicans can’t scramble fast enough to declare their loyalty to Putin.
