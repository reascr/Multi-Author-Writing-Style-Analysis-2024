That’s what they say in news… the reality is far worse inside Iran. The truth never comes out. Talk to someone who lives in Iran. Talk to the people in the streets and see what they say.
The truth never comes out of Iran. The reality is far worse. Talk to someone in Iran and you’ll see Talk to the people who survived the protests and see what they say. Most are dead and missing. And THATS NOT EVEN A WAR God damn people just protesting their government and getting shot in the face. Taxi driver honked his horn in the street, guard came up beside him and shot him in the head… woman took of her scarf and was shotgun in the chest… Women and children…. Iranian government maybe Russia’s Ally but the people aren’t !
These motherfuckers lie as easy as drinking water. Don’t believe a thing they say.. how many have they killed so far ??? More than all the casualties in the Ukraine war.
No actual calculations of how many civilians are dead in Ukraine. But the estimates are somewhere around 100k conservatively. Just in Mariupol alone, the conservative estimate is about 25k. We'll probably never know though, because Russians are burying the dead with the rubble from the buildings. People will be searching for their dead loved ones for decades.
