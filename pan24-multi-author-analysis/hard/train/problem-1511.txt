Good lord i've been hearing this crap for a decade now. BRICS will never make its own currency and its absurd to even suggest that that will. The Saudis won't do shit they need the US to deal with Iran. Would you care to guess who is allied with Iran? That's right, most BRICS countries.
BRICS isn't new. And I think the only reason why there was a lull in the media about it was due to Bolsonaro trying to distance Brazil from it altogether.
If countries stop trading oil in USD then they will no longer need to keep the amounts of USD that lead them to use it for other international trade. If countries start using their own currencies, instead of USD, for international trade, that is when I think the USD will have issues. I am no fortune teller and can't predict the future, but the US today benefits for the this oil-trade-in-USD arrangement.
The main factor I am following is whether or not Saudi Arabia starts selling oil in non-USD currencies. That arrangement has held since the 70s. I am not sure what the world would look like if that changes.
