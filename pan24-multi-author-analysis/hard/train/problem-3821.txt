ITT: People across the world woefully unaware of the Dutch nitrogen crisis, it's relation to the Dutch housing crisis, the relative amount of nitrogen emitted by farms, and the percentage of food that we're not even producing for ourselves.
That's right, you also need an environment that can sustain the nitrogen emissions that farms like that bring, without the nitrogen emissions being a danger to nature and jeopardizing housing developments (which also emit nitrogen).
“Excess nitrogen in the atmosphere can produce pollutants such as ammonia and ozone, which can impair our ability to breathe, limit visibility and alter plant growth. When excess nitrogen comes back to earth from the atmosphere, it can harm the health of forests, soils and waterways.” Aug 11, 2022.
“The air in Earth's atmosphere is made up of approximately 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen. Air also has small amounts of other gases, too, such as carbon dioxide, neon, and hydrogen”.
I read they article. The atmosphere is already 78% nitrogen. What is excess nitrogen? 79%? 80/81/85 more? The amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere is already causing the problems that are noted. It’s a part of our environment. It’s natural. It’s preposterous to think that we need to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere to offset the “problems” that it causes.
You've already got your opinion formed about why the policies are dumb without even knowing the effects of too much nitrogen on the _local, not atmospheric_ problem.
