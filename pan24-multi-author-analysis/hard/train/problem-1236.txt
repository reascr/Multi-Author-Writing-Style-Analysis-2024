They said between 3000 and 6000 left. The difference in votes in 1122 so far. Some of these are ballots needing to be cured, some are mail ballots from overseas.
Yet people still say 'look at the polls' in the runup to the election. That is the actual problem. Our electorate is broken and polls are only a small part of that problem. Yes, Nate's in depth analysis might be spot on and utterly impeccable on methodology, but we live in a headline society. Even here, in one of the more 'aware' communities on reddit, people rarely get past the headline.
I really hope people start ignoring 538. When was their last election prediction actually correct? 2012?
538 is an opinion site. People forget that and treat anything they say as gospel. I have been anti-538 this whole cycle and telling folks to not trust ANY polls, people got pissy about it.
This is why I think polling is absolute bullshit. The only people who should see it is campaigns. Otherwise you create a feedback loop and collapse Schroedinger's votes.
