Even worse. Exxon Mobil in like the 70s did their own scientific studies into fossil fuels and climate change. Iirc they predicted earths atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the effects it would have as a result of fossil fuel use. The data showed their industry would be devastating to our climate and humanity itself writhing 100 years so they hid the data and lied for decades before it was unearthed. Then they started lying about being climate conscious and as of fossil fuel industry communications between execs released a few weeks ago we now know they have 0 interest in climate conscious solutions and will milk every dollar out of the air we breathe while building bunkers because they’re afraid of what they’re bringing upon us.
50 years ago we had modern accurate data telling us that if we don’t change our entire economic system and the way we produce energy then millions if not billions of people would die, be displaced, and entire areas of land on earth would become newly uninhabitable to humans. But because it was rich and powerful people in a destructive industry making them billions of dollars a year nothing was and nothing will be done.
They were called alarmist nutters by the politicians and corporations who really love raking in money from doing exactly what caused the problem, and they are still raking it in today.
Even if it was halted right now today, it is way too late. The coastal populations around the world are going to be fucked, and poor people everywhere, of course.
