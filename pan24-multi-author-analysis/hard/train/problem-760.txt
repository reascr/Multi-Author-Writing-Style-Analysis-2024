It looks like Putin has decided trump is no longer such a useful asset. He's now pushing DeSantis on the Republicans.
Desantis is coming with the full weight of the right wing media behind him. I want to watch Trump just as any more sentient being. But I really want him to do that thing where he makes up a stupid nickname for a person and then somehow everyone is talking about the nickname and agreeing that it is a lethal zinger that has destroyed the recipientâ€™s electability. I dont really understand how it works. But I really need him to do it to Desantis, I feel like Anthony Michael Hall in the strangely good DeadZone Series from the early 2000s. Desantis is a more competent Trump.
Anyone who tries to act like Trump's nature is a recent revelation should not be trusted. If they can't acknowledge their own complicity and error, they are still ready to jump right back in to insanity. They are just hedging their bets.
She criticizes Trump for supporting vaccination. That's her big beef with him. She says he's old and ignorant because he doesn't know how to do his own "research" by watching TV and trolling the internet for the latest antivax conspiracy nonsense.
These people were told all of the problems with him. They were warned. We begged them to be reasonable. We warned them that this wouldn't wash off.
Candace Owens is a grifter. She's a Machiavellian in the Dark Triad. She doesn't give a fuck about anything other than her own wealth and power. She just wants a horde of fans who will pay her to feed them poison. She gets off on it.
Gotta give it to her. She's really good at her job. Now her job is being The human embodiment of a piece of s. But she really gives it her all every day . She makes the best kapo I've ever seen.
