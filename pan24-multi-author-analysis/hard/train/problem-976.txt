Yeah but the current government also does not let opposition stand much high. The current scenario is they have a golden face (Modi) which they can't let be tarnished even one bit so that they could do all the things they want in its shadow. If this article had any other name from top dogs it wouldn't have mattered. But tarnishing the Modi name is tarnishing their most crucial selling point.
I vote for BJP in elections but this is more and more like our Red Neighbours across Himalayas. This ban on things government don't subscribe to.
Articles or videos sensistive to the government are not banned. A lot of Indian media itself has articles or videos dedicated to political commentary in which they rightly criticize Modi for many of his faults, which are often the first thing you will see.
As a person with brains, you should ask yourself why a documentary regarding the Indian PM was not made available by BBC in India and what was the objective of it.
And also keep in mind that UK's current PM (Rishi Sunak) does not agree with the documentary regarding Modi, according to reporting from BBC itself (.
But anyway...the UK leadership (Rishi Sunak) has also disagreed with Modi's characterization in the documentary, which is thankful. I would be quite worried if the west was full of gullible people that believe everything they see or hear without questioning whether a particular piece is propaganda or not.
