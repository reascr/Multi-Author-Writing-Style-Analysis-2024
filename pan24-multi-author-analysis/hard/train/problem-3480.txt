Remember those stupid poll results that come up from time to time that " Congress is less popular than syphilis"?
Do you really think syphilis has even 8% support? There's obviously a floor on each question for people to just pick something at random.
His best chance at winning the nomination is probably him pressuring state parties to cancel the primaries and hand it to him. Many state level party apparatus is are dominated by the trimpiest of trimpy. So could very well get some - he doesn't need all of them, just enough to block competition from wining.
This is kind of what the GQP is trying to do in the SCOTUSb right now. End run around democracy. But hey, it's not like they care for it.
That's the whole point. They want him gone, but they don't want to do the dirty work themselves otherwise they might offend his cult.
They always wanted him gone, but didnâ€™t want to pay the consequences of doing the right thing. They have always hoped to play the clock just right and let the democrats do all of the dirty work and take all the blame. Republicans are spineless, cynical cowards. But they are patient and clever cowards.
