You just explained why years of "Build the Wall" was so stupid. Dems never wanted open boarders, they wanted the money spent for modern tech like scanners at points of entry, drones, more security personnel etc. Oh and more detainment facilities and lawyers to deal with the influx of asylum seekers. But nooooo let's build a fuckin wall cause stupid people like stupid solutions.
That ignores the difficulty of building the wall in the first place. In order to get construction equipment and materials to the spots where the wall is being constructed, roads (even if temporary) need to be built. These roads, and even some of the property that the wall will be built on will need to have land seized from private owners by the Government. Much of the terrain is also very rough with mountains, canyons, etc., in the patch of construction.
There are plenty of reasons to oppose a massive border wall even if you are in favor of stricter border and immigration enforcement.
Serious question from a non-America… why is it so bad to just build a continuous wall to help enforce the border? Would it not help at all? How much would it really cost? Politically, couldn’t agreeing to build a wall help reach a political consensus that includes an improved immigration policy?
Ironically, that was exactly the year President Bush and Democrats in Congress reached a grand bargain for comprehensive immigration reform, including amnesty, temp worker program, and expanding the border wall.
