Now, enough countries have voiced objections for Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in 2024 Olympic.
Yeah but I think that there are few countries especially from eastern Europe which are very serious with this idea so if Russian and Belarusian would still participate they would indeed boycott Olimpics. That would make olimpic committee looks like clowns and I really doubt that they would withstand this criticism from western media. It will be probably the same like it was with Mundial. In case of Poland I'm assure that public would be 100% for boycott. Especially that one of the most important moments in our sport history is when Kozakiewicz showed bras d'honneur to audience during Moscow Olimpics.
Boycott of 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics had huge impact because 3 countries from top 5 of previous Olimpics (U.S.A., West Germany, Japan) didn't participate.
One article I read stated 40 countries may boycott 2024 Olympic. If IOC refuse to budge then Olympic as we know it may end in 2024.
They're gonna ban 40 countries from the Olympics? Cool. Either start a new one, or when (not if) you find some dirt on the existing committee, lock 'em up and put some one else in.
