From what sources? This is the issue my friend. A few billionaires able to pave the way or (hundreds of) thousands of citizens wanting a better life. Which sounds like a proper source of funds for electioneering. Yes there are billionaires that donate to Democrats and spend for Democrats; not even close to the amount involved with the Republicans.
What does Sanders have to say about billionaires giving money to Democrats? What does Sanders have to say about Democrats who willingly take money from these billionaires?
Are there are no large donations to Democrats? And why are you still so hung up on the size of individual donations? If I give $100 to Republican PACs while the Democrats raise $1 from each of 1 million people, you would probably still be going on rants about huge donations to the GOP. The size of any individual donation is 100% irrelevant.
Limiting how much a politician can accept from any individual is not the same as telling everyone in the country what they can and can not spend their money on.
This could work similarly with politicians where they could only receive up to a certain amount. I would also limit it to campaign support only and not allow politicians to be bought for bill/law support!
