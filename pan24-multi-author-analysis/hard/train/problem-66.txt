North Carolina is holding on by a thread. We only just managed to escape a state supermajority, so our next election will be super important to keep fighting back the supermajority.
But really we need federal help to overturn the gerrymandering because the state is not as conservative as the legislature makes it seem.
But since the civil war, we really said "hey you fuckwad backwater states can't be trusted" and pulled towards a more centralized system where federal law reigns more powerful.
If federalism is the correct model - then we should abolish a lot of the rules that make the coasts subsidize the south and Midwest. We should be free to legalize what we want, ban what we don't. And the federal government should be forced to recognize our will. Obviously this will impede a lot of commerce and travel since people won't want to cross the line into places like Idaho.
If it's a centralized government- then they need to STFU with all this backwards stuff. No more electoral college, no more abortion bans because a few states wanted it.
The abortion bans are just an extension of the shit policies of these states. If you compare a map of poor healthcare, maternity death, child hunger, poor performing schools, and poverty, youâ€™ll find the map looks similar. These states are designed to keep people down.
