Tolkien then went on to create a world with obviously evil antagonists, who utilized crude weaponry in large volumes and cared little for life (both others and their own).... wait, was he writing about russia?
As for your second comment... More than 50% of the deaths in Iraq over the last 2 decades occured during the rise of ISIS, who perpetrated those deaths as well. A large number of civilians also died due to IEDs. In total the US AND COALITION, were responsible for 37% of the estimated 120k deaths over the last 2 decades due to misidentification, deliberate acts of war crime, or collateral effects.
While it's sad, it needs to be done. Russia will only accept the theft and enslavement of cities who don't want to join them. To be culminated as they are you've gotta grind those forces down. The real sad number is the total number of civilians killed by russia, or the collective total of hospitals destroyed, or the millions of people russia just shut the electricity off on.
There is an unusual and not very publicized consequence of Russia's extreme losses in tiny areas: human decay. You'll only hear about it from Ukrainian military vloggers from time to time, but the density of the corpses releases toxic fumes that make it utterly unsafe to maintain positions. And neither side is capable of recovering and burying that many bodies from no-man's land. The entire position has to shift upwind every so often, as nobody without a certain grade gas mask on can remain in the area.
