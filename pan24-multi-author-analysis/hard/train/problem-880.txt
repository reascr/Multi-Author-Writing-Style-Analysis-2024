"Equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism" is weak. The threat of violence to achieve a political end is by definition terrorism. If the Republicans are going to get upset about it either way, why not just call it what it is?
Also, to be fair, a perhaps even better question that should be asked is, "why did the Republicans do it in the first place?".
Yep. Conservatives break rules and act violently, then get the slightest and most gentle reprimands and then scream that they are being targeted for "being conservative.".
It's like with Trump claiming Witch Hunt. He's actually been given every benefit of the doubt possible. His lawyer went to prison for doing stuff he ordered him to do, and "Unidicted Co-conspirator" got off Scot free. Mueller laid out a number of probable crimes and he was let off the hook again. A strong majority of the Senate even voted to convict him but due to the rules he was acquitted. He's gotten away with more illegal shit than any other American could possibly expect while staying out of jail. He's ripped off millions of people and paid almost nothing for it. He got fewer votes than Hillary but became president anyway. He inherited half a billion dollars. He's taken over $1B in government subsidies in his life. He takes out loans and doesn't repay them. He doesn't pay the people who work for him despite promising he will. He took massive bribes from the Saudis and others through his business while he was president, and there were no repercussions at all. He tried to overthrow a fair election and so far has not seen any kind of punishment for it. Yet he claims he is the world's biggest victim, that it is actually poor homeless black people who are getting all the special treatment while he is just constantly getting the shit end of the stick.
