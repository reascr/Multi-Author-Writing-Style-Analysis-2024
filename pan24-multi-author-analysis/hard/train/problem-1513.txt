Eh, I don't know. They talk about critical thinking in public school, but they don't do a great job of teaching students how to internalize it. Now private liberal arts schools, those are all about that shit.
Edit: Critical thinking just kicked in. Yes. They teach the "theory" of critical thinking in public school.
They do nothing to educate the public. They only incite, tease, mislead but never inform. The public can wait a little bit to have this information. What are we going to do with it? It is not going to change anyone's mind about anything. Even if there is someone who doesn't have a hard and fast opinion on trump who will review this information and changes their mind, it won't do anything for the millions of other people who either want the guy convicted or exonerated in court.
The media banding together to push for a reveal irks me. They do such a poor job at everything except trying to generate ratings that I hate that they get to call their activities as supporting "public interest.".
That is true, look it up. Trump made fools of all you Georgia voters. Yes there is still plenty that has to come out, and more indictments will be coming down.
Makes sense if there is to be an indictment coming. You can't let trump baby make the case of a prejudiced jury against him because the information is out there. I want to see everything too, but damn, I'll wait if someone will actually hold him to accountability. I can see the findings after or during the trial. I just want that pos to pay for his crimes; for trying to destroy and continuing to have a hand in the ongoing destruction attempts of this country.
