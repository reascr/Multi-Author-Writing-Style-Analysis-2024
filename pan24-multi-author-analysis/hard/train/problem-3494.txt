What's the point of a voting system that gives you absolute majority power on 43% of the vote if you can't use that power to force others to make you money???!
And? That will never happen. Who is going to organize it? How are they going to convince all or even most police to sign on? And how are you going to keep it secret before it's ready to go off? How is that cop going to avoid being fired before the strike ever happens?
People act like planning strikes when striking is forbidden in the digital world is just a matter of everyone striking together.
This is essentially a general strike now, not a bunch of individuals. The government can't cow the teachers, nurse, ambulance drivers, firefighters and rail workers. They will lose.
I'm not surprised you get down voted. It's hyperbole. The UK is on a downward trajectory but it won't amount to what you're saying. In the 70s the UK economy dipped below Italy for a bit. That's kind of a worst case scenario. Nobody's claiming Italy isn't a wealthy country.
