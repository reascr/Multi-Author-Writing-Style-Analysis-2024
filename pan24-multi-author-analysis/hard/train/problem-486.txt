She refused to move into the WH until Trump agreed to reopen their prenup and give her more money. Can you fucking imagine the shitstorm if a Democrat president was married to an immigrant who clearly hated him, hated the idea of being First Lady, and saw his presidency only as an opportunity to gain financial leverage for herself? There's also the fact that even when she did sack up and move into the WH, she almost certainly didn't actually live there full time. Feels like Fox News would have had plenty to say about that.
Exactly. Trump literally spent multiple hours a day - at least 3, probably closer to 5 - watching TV and tweeting about everything he saw that hurt his feelings. We know this not only because the people who worked with him told reporters about it, but also because we could all see his twitter account. He would tweet immediate responses to segments on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, or whatever other channel he watched. I remember a bunch of people would use the time stamps on his tweets to show what was playing on TV at those exact times. He would also record a ton of cable news shows to watch later on, and we always knew when he did, because he couldn't stop himself from tweeting about it. It's just so wild to me that Trump literally didn't do any actual work while he was president, he barely even bothered to hide that fact, and Republicans were just cool with it.
He did such a piss poor job of actually using his presidential power, I don't think that was really what interested him.
People thinking he'd be a great president because he was a good (but actually terrible) business man was so obnoxious. The country shouldn't be run like someone's business, that's ridiculous. They based their reasoning for liking him as president on pure lies, like this and also that he "tells it like it is" which also couldn't have been further from the truth. He tells it like a bigoted moron who has no idea what he's talking about, much like his voters.
