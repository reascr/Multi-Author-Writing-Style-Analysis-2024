In NZ there has been a very concerted effort to re-honour the te reo version of the Treaty of Waitangi. There has been a number of court cases and land handover to Iwi in NZ for decades now.
Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei was granted land taken from them in the heart of Auckland in 1988 as part of the Settlement process for the Treaty. They also were given possession of their Mārae back, which is incredibly important to Māori culture.
In Māori culture, great value is placed on many historically and culturally significant objects. Māori honour and preserve those artifacts.
What? Westerners are not the only people who preserve culture. The reason that many artifacts are in western museums and collections is because they were stolen from indigenous people.
2) Looted artefacts are not cultural appropriation. It is... looted/stolen artefacts. Now if the collectors of the meres were running around chanting gibberish while swinging them around then you _might_ have a point, but you don't because they aren't.
They do it with written agreements. And hint as to why your point does not matter here: ONE OF THE SIGNEES ON THE AGREEMENT IS THE MUSEUM, AND MUSEUMS DO NIT DIE LIKE PEOPLE DO, THEY ARE CONTINUOUS ENTITIES. There is a world of difference between limitations agreed to in a written contract between a family and a museum, and a verbal agreement between two private people.
If it turns out my great great grandfather had loaned your great great grandfather a car, under the condition that if the car ever left your family then you would owe my family a new car, and your dad decided to sell it, how would you feel about me coming after you for the money? After all, that was the verbal agreement a hundred years ago? Or would you say "sorry no, that is ridiculous, I did not make the agreement"?
