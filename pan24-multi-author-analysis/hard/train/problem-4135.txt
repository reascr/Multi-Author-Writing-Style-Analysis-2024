Well, there is always an opportunity to learn. So here you go in terms of the US army, the easy version. A squad is normally lead by a corporal or specialist depending on what military and branch of service they are with. That is an enlisted rank, which is the lowest of ranks. It is the highest enlisted rank before you become a non-commissioned officer. They are above privates which are the lowest ranks. Non-commissioned officers are sergeants. There are many different types of sergeants ranging for a regular old sergeant which is the lowest non-commission all the way up to the rank of sergeant major which is the highest rank of enlisted ranks. Above enlisted ranks you have officers. Officers are 2nd lieutenant, 1st lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and different grades of generals.
So the issue here is that they are calling him a commander when he is a fairly low ranking individual. In US army terms, he could have less than a few years of service and no formal leadership training. He would have no authority to make big picture decisions. NCOs and officers have special schools they go to in order to learn how to lead. Even then, lieutenants don't really lead. They assist a captain who leads a company, which is 4-5 platoons and each platoon has 3-4 squads. Captain is the lowest rank that would actually constitute a "commander" as they are the first rank who actually holds the title of Commanding Officer. Most laypeople would be looking for someone with the rank of lieutenant colonel, which lead a battalion of 1,000+ troops, before they really start considering them a commander.
The first level officer that could be a commander is usually a lieutenant who would command a platoon or a company. This guy was a squad leader which is usually a corporal or buck sergeant.
He was a platoon-leader. That's the junior-most command position you can have, both in Russia and western militaries. The average age of lieutenants in the US army is 25 for example.
