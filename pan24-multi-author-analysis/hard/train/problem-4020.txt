Try digging trenches against the US Air Force and see what happens. I’ll give you a hint; it’s not a “the style of fighting that’s prevailing,” result as you say.
A large scale “near peer” modern war, and the style of fighting that’s prevailing is what we know now as basically an ancient style of fighting. Absolutely absurd.
Everybody on both sides has a will to live first and foremost, and a will to win that follows. “Here we are” is true, because again, I’m watching it right now, “here this is because of several very specific variables” is also true, because again, an obvious will to live. They aren’t trench fighting just to be retro. They are doing it (currently) because it’s the way their war fighting doctrine has developed, all entirely in the name of keeping themselves alive to win another day.
100 years of war later, to include and second and even bigger world war, between all of the movies and video games depicting modern wars, MASSIVE leaps in technological and tactical advancements, here we are;.
If it were the US fighting Russia, it wouldn’t even look like war, it would look like the nations trading stars and millions of souls vaporizing in an instant.
