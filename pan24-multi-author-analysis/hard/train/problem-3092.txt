"He killed millions, because he tried to prepare his people to the most deadliest War in history. "There is no other way in the War. We won, so all the victims were justified. (30 million dead citizens, thousands of destroyed settlements)".
Evil will eat millions of russians firstly, as usual, but then may cause another problems to the Humanity again.
But if global community will leave more than hundred millions of russian people alone in this lands of chaos, pain and misery, The Evil can come back once.
You are of course right in every regard but the trouble is that it's becoming more and more difficult to see Russian's as victims as the attrocities mount.
Recreate relationships would be extremely hard, but it is work that need to be done, especially from side of Russia.
How do we get from here to a place where we can see Russians as anything close to friends again? It seems to me that it is inevitable that evil will return. I honestly don't see the current lot suffering all that much for their crimes either.
