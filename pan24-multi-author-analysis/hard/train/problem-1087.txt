Someone needs to take these folk by the shoulders, shake them up a bit and look into their eyes then say "They want to fucking kill you. That's not a joke. It's not a metaphor. It's probably not gonna happen today, or tomorrow (though it might if you end up walking with the wrong group in the parking lot of a rally), but they literally want people like you to cease to exist. It's happened before. It can happen again. And, again, and I can't stress his enough: they want to fucking kill you. Not at first. First, you won't be able to get married, or adopt children, or you'll even have your children taken away from you. Then your businesses will be exploited by the government, no matter what happens to the businesses of cis straight white guys. Then you won't be able to use public transportation, and certain jobs will be closed to you. Then they'll make you wear a pink triangle when you're out in public. But eventually, maybe in a decade, maybe in two, if they get everything they want, they will fucking kill you. And nobody will stop them.".
It is. Boehner was a jackass, but at least he knew how to think, even if I disagreed with him. People around here don't even see him as much of a Republican anymore, which is bullshit.
