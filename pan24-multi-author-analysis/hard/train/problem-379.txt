For those wondering, IBAMA is the EPA of Brazil. They are very strict and powerful when allowed to exert their authority with the full support of leadership. This is a great first step for the pushback against the mass deforestation happening on the perimeters of the Amazon rainforest.
“Reforestation includes planting trees or allowing trees to regrow on land that had recently been covered with forest.”.
We can help to restore forests on barren ground by planting trees and protecting them as seedlings, such as by putting artificial moisture retaining materials around the roots, to help them become established and survive dry spells. It may also need fencing to protect it from grazing animals that would strip a sampling of all of its leaves.
Also it depends on the soil and moisture conditions. Plants create their own climate around them because they slowly release moisture into the air as they breathe and photosynthesize. Meanwhile their roots stabilize loose soil to prevent erosion and retain moisture.
