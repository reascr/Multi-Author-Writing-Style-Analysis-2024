She's been critical of Israel & AIPAC, was in favor of boycotting products from the colonized areas and a Muslim. Therefor she's a great target for them to pretend antisemitism is a leftist thing.
The worst thing she did is word some of her criticism a bit unfortunate or clunky. But for Republicans criticism of Israel is antisemitic, while maligning Jews in your own country isn't.
Omar has criticized Israel in the past so the new Republican leadership said "We won't stand for anti-semites! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤" And kicked her off her committees. Meanwhile the actual anti-semite Republicans are given their choice of positions.
Smart Republicans care about electability, but they're in the minority. Most Republicans want racism, little dances, and insulting nicknames. If you promise to hurt the people they hate, they'll love you forever.
I think you're right. Trump will crush him, to the dismay of party leaders. He has a power over stupid people that is not of this world. It's the racism, the little dances, the exaggerated facial expressions, something.
