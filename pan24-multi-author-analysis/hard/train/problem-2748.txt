The cliques were TERRIBLE. I was 12, too. And we had just moved to that area the year before. Everyone felt so fake. I just couldn’t figure out how to get an in. I did not make friends, and I started coming up with every excuse in the book to not go to church after the experience.
By the time I was in college, most of my friends were at least agnostic. I was beginning to question many things.
I was a strong believer, not a strong Christian per se. Attended youth group, went to Christian camps, etc., but didn’t really practice what was preached. I didn’t believe in the magical BS, but figured Jesus was the son of God and died for our sins (never understood how that worked though).
I think offering secular world religion classes are for the greater good. The ones I took so not teach WHAT to believe but teach what those who practice said religion believe. Knowing what others believe, why they believe it, and the percentage of population that believe the same is extremely eye-opening.
The more intelligent the population, the less likely they are to fall for the indoctrination and believe things without evidence.
