wait, isn't that like an example of efficiency and a good thing? I mean, it's a bad thing when they're squeezing the housing supply in a particular area to try and gouge prices, but building new houses in the right places sounds like a good thing, isn't it?
Depending on how steep those are, and if the proceeds are actually used to build more affordable housing, that could improve both rent and housing affordability.
I'd encourage you to actually watch and read through the links I posted more carefully rather than assuming you already know or understand what they say. Well-educated voters in a well-educated population are a big part of what's needed.
Voting is important, but so are education, unionization, anti-corruption reforms, and building other forms of collective power and leverage with respect to the ruling capitalist/kleptocrat class.
Under capitalism/kleptocracy, the ruling class makes most of the major economic decisions in society without any input from the workers.
Those capitalists/kleptocrats who benefit from the lack of economic democracy will also make political democracy a bit of a farce in order to preserve their power and privilege.
