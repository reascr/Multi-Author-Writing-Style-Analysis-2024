Well I understand the US defensiveness considering when China was fighting the Korean war (when China insisted on postponing elections after a promised date, insisted on the illegitimate sygnman Rhee government who Sabre-rattled and probed the north), Chinese generals went to the papers asking for permission to nuke the US, and knowingly instigated a counterattack along the US border... oh wait that wasn't china????
Every single reddit take on US-china relations is entirely divorced from any historical context and its incredibly embarrassing.
Your take of the US-china relations is entirely divorced from any historical context and its incredibly embarrassing.
The US had a very minor part in the century of humiliation . And it's not like China has not bullied or invaded it's neighbors when it perceived itself to be the middle kingdom.
Because it is currently bullying it's neighbors and trying to impose ridiculous claims on the south China sea matter-of-fact it's not only the US but it's neighbors that consider China a threat.
And, given China's increasingly belligerent attitude to international norms, I think that's a useful comment to make.
Well I understand the US antagonism because China's invasion of the US + forced trade, the American "century of humiliation" by every other Asian power in the 19th century... oh wait.
