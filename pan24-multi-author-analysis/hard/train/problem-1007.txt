So if sounds like if they're nearby they may just have to bring their laptop over once a month or soemthing lol. I guess the issue is you don't know when that's gonna be and will be annoying. Prob the only thing th ex and I could actually agree on. No reason to sub twice for kids streaming.. just annoying for the one parent that wants to use it occasionally as well. Been kinda looking for an excuse to cancel Netflix so we will see how it plays out.
"For viewers who frequently travel or own a second home, Netflix says the account holder will have to sign in on their Netflix mobile app at least once a month while connected to the Wi-Fi at their primary location.".
Yep. I can see why the suits want this feature, but there's no way to implement it that doesn't inconvenience families with kids in college - one of the main legitimate use cases - or which doesn't introduce hilarious loopholes, like how you should theoretically be able to share an account with other people in your dorm.
You mean like college students? They're probably one of the main demographics of legitimate sharing, but Netflix only lets that happen if they can go home at least once a month.
But even if you could come up with a reasonable technological definition of a household, I still feel like watching on multiple screens is less likely than you'd think. To me, at least, that always felt like a feature to allow for college students and similar, so you don't have to coordinate watching times at multiple locations. (Think "Get off the phone, I need to use the internet") There are still some use cases for multiple screens, like if someone wants to watch on their commute, but they're a lot less common.
Honestly, though. If they just made it something like one location per screen, I feel like there'd be a lot less of a pushback. Because currently, they're making weird assumptions like 4 people all watching it at the same time in the same house.
