Since most Dems are Christian, I'd say that they are speaking up, at least a little. We can do our part by donating to Dems and voting.
It’s possibly to show ‘bipartisanship’ with all democrats and a good amount of repubs voting against it. Then they can parade that they are working with the dems, but the dems won’t work with them on other bills, and they can blame them for not wanting bipartisanship.
Eh we have Lisa Murkowski here in Alaska, I don’t agree with all of her politics but she seems to want to work with Democrats to pass things that benefit her constituents instead of just refusing to negotiate. There aren’t many but there are some.
I can agree with that, because at some point they are going to just get tired of losing elections (and now they don’t even lose according to them, they think it is obvious that it’s all a conspiracy and cheating, they can never concede that their ideas just aren’t popular with the voter base) and they will just openly declare war on people who don’t believe what they do. That, I believe, is a reality that will come within my lifetime.
