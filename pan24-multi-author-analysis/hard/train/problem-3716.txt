Yeah, I also hate the "no one is talking about this" on something that went viral gaslighting. Also, figures like MTG all followed it up with "but look at this UFO instead" gaslighting as well. She took a balloon around congress before the state of the union as a PR stunt, she doesn't get to also claim the UFO/balloon news is meant to distract us? The brazenness of their gaslighting blows my mind.
As for lack of public awareness opening the door to right-wing conspiracy theories, I don't know, I wish good public awareness stopped them. However, things like the Paul Polosi attack got plenty of public awareness and right-wing conspiracy theories still flourished.
This opened the door for right-wing conspiracy theories to flourish, because of such a tremendous lack of attention.
This isnt "gaslighting". The gaslighting is claiming that between the dates of 03Feb to 13Feb, that this story had gained sufficient traction to fully make the public aware of what was happening.
Deadass this was not reported anywhere close to the level that it demanded. From the dates of 03Feb-13Feb, very few stories were being published outside local media sources with informative updates. 08Feb had a spike of stories as they reported officials were allowing people to return to their homes.
