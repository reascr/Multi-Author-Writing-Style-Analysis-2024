After wading thru about 75 morons blaming the injury on the covid vaccine I gave up and went elsewhere.
Well I have an account on this website and can curate what I see. On Twitter even when I had an account they changed things and people who would be stupid enough to say that were mostly blocked or filtered. Now they are all you see.
You think you can curate what you see. That might be true until there’s a policy change that impacts Reddit’s ranking algorithms. That happens here but the difference is Reddit doesn’t package it in a huge press release saying “we’re going to break a bunch of stuff so we can make more money!”.
Here to say this. Political ads are NOT a meaningful source of revenue for any major social media platform. I’m guessing this announcement is just a signal for bad actors to start sending dirty money to Twitter.
That will depend on the platform, their policies and how much they self-police. The biggest social media companies have either banned or heavily restricted targeting in political ads. If Twitter allows relatively unrestricted political ads or just fails to police their own platform, they could capture a sizable chunk of the $1.5B digital political ad spend this year assuming they have a presence in the right markets. I suspect Elon also believes any shenanigans will be covered up by Republican political cronies.
