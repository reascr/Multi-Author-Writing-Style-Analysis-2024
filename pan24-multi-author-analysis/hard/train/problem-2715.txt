I think Republicans are well aware that they will not be able to retain political majorities in the future unless they disenfranchise urban voters. So here we are with a completely ridiculous reading of the Constitution, and it is not a coincidence that this comes on the tail of Republicans raising unsubstantiated voter fraud claims and an activist conservative supermajority at the Supreme Court.
Because Citizens United allows “public advocacy groups” to make expenditures and not have to include the names of their donors in their filings. As long as these organizations don’t have a “primary purpose” of electoral advocacy, but there’s an invisible wink wink by primary purpose from what I’ve gathered. Also the proposition that money is first amendment protected speech is honestly ridiculous and completely out of line with “originalism” or “textualism”.
No. It removes state court judicial oversight and allows state legislatures to do whatever they want as far as federal elections go only subject to federal law (which could ultimately include deciding an election is fraudulent and sending in fake electors, and that couldn’t even be stopped by federal law in theory if ISL is embraced).
If the Supreme Court rules that state legislatures no longer need abide by state courts or state constitutions, so that, indeed, state electors no longer need vote in line with the results of state elections, and can do whatever it is that the state legislature decides, completely on its own, to do, then it is time for every citizen to own a gun.
> They are pushing for a ruling that would take ultimate decisions about voting rights and congressional gerrymandering away from state courts and hand those powers to state legislatures, of which Republicans now control the majority.
