True. At least, in her case she would have stayed more of an inigma. Unfortunately she choose a path that allowed her true nature to show and that is why she failed I think.
The bad news is yes, he will probably be the Republican nomination. The good news is there's a difference between any election with him in it and the past election. During the past election, many people went 3rd party because they didn't like Hillary. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. Hillary sunk her own nomination with many people because of what she did to Bernie and how she took Debbie Schultz into her campaign after DWS resigned due to the scandle during that primary l. I am sorry, but Hillary is not liked at all in the republican party and many do not like her on the Democrat side. She should never have run, in my opinion. Now, though, everyone is aware of the nightmare known as trump, and they are most likely going to vote for the democrat candidate.
magas will only vote for trump, non-magas will vote for any republican that they think can win. republicans only care about power so they’ll all fall in line. they know where the base is and it ain’t with Soft Hands Ron.
