Killing other soldiers is one thing and trapping places enemy soldiers will likely come is just a part of war.
I'm replying specifically to a comment about leaving traps for the military and you keep talking about leaving traps for civilians.
There's a huge difference between traps meant for enemy combatants killing civilians and traps meant for civilians killing civilians. They could set traps on solely military objects like weapons, APCs, tanks, munitions, military helicopters, etc or locations like military bases. Instead, they are setting traps in civilian houses, in civilian home appliances, on civilian corpses and on injured civilians.
If you are against traps that are found by civilians, you're against traps and ambushes, period. No such thing as understanding if it's for soldiers.
The line is razor thin when in urban combat. So thin you should always assume any trap you left for a soldier will harm a civilian.
Planting bombs to kill civilians is what you'd expect them to do, given their stated goal. In general, this is why appeasement won't work, and why Russia must be demilitarized for a lasting peace.
