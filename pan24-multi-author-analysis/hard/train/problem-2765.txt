Obligation to serve herself. If democrats actually elected some progressives and not these same old geriatric fucks they might actually win some god damn elections on policy instead of getting votes because “this one’s better than those guys”.
I wish that I could argue that having an older political voice in office helps to keep the older demographic relevant because they would fight to keep them afloat through Social Security and welfare programs, but these old assholes In office have shown that they couldn't give a single iota of a fuck for their generation, so I say fuck it, and convince the older generation to embrace the new blood that may actually care about them.
Feinstein is a barely cognitive dinosaur, and those are the facts. This is not a bi partisan issue, it is a term limitations issue that needed to happen decades ago.
Decades ago is an entire era in political terms. States sometimes move from red to purple in the course of 8 years (see Georgia and Arizona) let alone decades. And California in specific has gone from swing in the 90s to blue in the early 2000s to very blue now.
2) It's much easier to win as the minority party for a local/state office than a federal office. For the former, the races are less nationalized: you can downplay the national party's platform and play to regional issues. Much harder to do that when it's a Senate race.
There are going to be at least two true progressives in this Senate primary race. Both Porter and Barbara Lee are definitely left of center.
