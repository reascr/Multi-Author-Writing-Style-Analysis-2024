It's the opposite of the Iron Dome. Iron Dome is for intercepting short-range low-value improvised rockets and artillery shells. Patriot is mainly for ballistic missiles and high-value targets.
Patriot is primarily designed to shoot down ballistic missiles and high-end threats. The missiles are 2,000 pounds with a 200-pound warhead. They will crush airplanes and missiles out to about 100 miles, intercepting at Mach 4+. The cost per intercept is millions of dollars, so the system is designed to protect high-value assets from high-end threats. The system is huge and not rapidly mobile.
They use shoot-and-scoot tactics to evade counter-battery fire. It's still an elaborate and complex job to keep those valuable HIMARS safe. Russia has drones and satellites hunting for the launchers and ammunition all the time. They constantly move things around and probably have far more decoys than actual launchers. Russia is outmatched by American weapons and support, but they aren't as incompetent as they have been made to look.
And in a serious note, no, it just makes it rather clear of the importance of US providing with "advanced" systems to Ukraine, in spite of all warnings against it from Russia.
