To which part of Peru is she going? If she's just gonna stay in Lima, she'll be mostly okay as long as she stays away from the Downtown (Cercado de Lima) unless necessary. But if she plans to move to the provinces, better to just cancel the trip (even more if her destination is the South). It's not worth the chance of getting stranded somewhere on the road.
Something most people leave unsaid is that Castillo also demanded elections for a Constitutional Assembly (no constitutional president can't call for that), the surrendering of all weapons in hands of civilians, that he would govern through Law-Decrees (a legal figure to describe the Executive is concentrating all lawmaking powers, hallmark of Peruvian dictatorships).
Granting the head of state of Peru the constitutional powers of the last democratic 1978 constitution is undemocratic apparently.
Nor will the Peruvians respect the 1993 constitution put in place by dictator Alberto Fujimori, when the 1978 democratic constitution would have granted Castillo the power to do so even if it is irregular for a democracy is still a more democratic documents rules to follow when determining the legitimate powers of an elected leader. After all its merely a discussion of what his powers are as head of state, not whether he should be able to outlive his elected term etc.
What you seem to desire is a super-presidential system, where the head of state has both extensive executive powers as well as extensive power over the legislature. This always leads to dictatorship.
