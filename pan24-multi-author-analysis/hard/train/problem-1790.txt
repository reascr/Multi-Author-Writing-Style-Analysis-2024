Depends if are counting to absolute zero (ie literally none left) or a relative zero (ie we only have shells we need for adequate strategic reserve). Majority of militaries count to a relative zero because they aren't in an end-of-the-world fight where you aren't concerned about strategic reserve.
Either is bad news because the war with Ukraine is an artillery war and, if they run out, things are going to get bleaker for the Russian lines.
Yeah, then Ukraine blew up a bunch of warehouses, and Russia shot a truly insane amount of artillery trying to force a win through Sievierodonetsk.
There’s also no shortage of claims of Russian artillery barrages being much less frequent and intense than they used to be. If Russian commanders expect 1000 shells in a certain time frame and they’re only capable of firing 200, that’s a pretty critical shortage even if 200 is a lot more than 0.
It's most likely that Russia's vast reserve of ammo is getting down to the point they are either nearing no excess beyond strategic reserve or they are already lowering the limit of their strategic reserve to free up more shells for the front.
