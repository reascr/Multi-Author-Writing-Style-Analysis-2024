Old soviet gear is simply not sufficient as it doesn't confer a technological advantage over Russian gear. It's a stopgap measure, nothing more.
Enabling Ukraine to, at scale, strike targets deep inside Russia will help to level the playing field, and this should be the absolute highest priority in terms of equipment delivery.
It's just all over once Ukraine gets F-16's too, because they'll have something Russia never had in enough numbers: Precision munitions.
The US is clearly running out of old equipment to send to Ukraine, they're now sending BFVs and M1 Abrams. I would also take that as a sign that things aren't going well for Ukraine right now, running out of able body soldiers.
I mean, there currently aren’t many Western tanks on the ground in Ukraine at all, so that bet seems extremely safe. However, I would be very interested in seeing the exact percentages, because my understanding is that the vast majority of Russian tanks in Ukraine are variants of the T-72, with no indication of that really changing.
Those are a risk, but I do think the original commenter’s point has some merit if you consider the value of modern optics systems vs the old ones used on most Russian tanks. In that scenario, it really is a 10 to 1 increase in value.
From what I’ve heard, target acquisition and optics are by far the single most important difference between truly modern tanks and everything else, when it comes to battlefield performance.
