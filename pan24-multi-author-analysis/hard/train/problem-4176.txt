Yeah sure fuck over Florida’s high school students trying to avoid debt and get a college degree without rich parents.
Parents are gonna love giving their kids a disadvantage heading into college! Oh wait, these idiot Republicans are willing to sacrifice their kid’s future to win the political game and stick it to the other side.
It is so painfully obvious that DeStantis is doing this shit because it is the favor/outrage of the day for Republicans. What is worse, often that outrage of the day solution has no real benefit for the average person. It is just theatre that hurts people. DeStantis is thinking about menstrual cycle, taking away AP classes, and attacking Disney when he and Tallassee should be figuring out insurance and rising rent.
I really wish Floridians would see this. This will be leopards ate my face territory when/if/is Florida becomes a bottom tier shithole state like the Mississippi, Alabama, etc. (Though, I get the argue that Florida is ALREADY a bottom tier shithole state).
