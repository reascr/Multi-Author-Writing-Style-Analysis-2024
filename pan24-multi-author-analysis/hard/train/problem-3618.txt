Yeah, I lived in Charleston for a few years. It's only progressive due to the large number of transplants living and moving there. Columbia and Greenville are a little bit progressive, too. I'm hoping that enough people continue moving to the state from other areas of the country to make the races more competitive, even though the natives hate it!
Yeah, I often heard locals disparaging people who moved there. Guess I blended in enough to hear this. I wanted to tell them that my husband and I were both recruited for jobs that required graduate degrees because there weren't enough educated local people to fill them, but I kept my mouth shut. Bless their hearts.
I don't know how Lindsey Graham survives. South Carolinians tend to be no-nonsense, and Lindsey Graham has more flip-flops than Myrtle Beach.
Then he gave a very cringey interview where he sat next to Herschel Walker and touted GOP diversity but didn't let Walker say a word.
Graham was on some sanctimonious horseshit earlier about how Democrats destroying Herschel Walker is about sending a message to black people that they can’t be Republicans. He’s such a fucking gross puke.
