What carrot do they even have anymore? Do poor conservatives think more tax cuts are coming? If they do, is this the most motivating factor? Is it even a factor at all anymore?
Remember, the most serious criticism of Trump came from a voter when she revealed: "he's not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.".
This is it. The carrot is limiting the rights of groups they don't like and hurting those groups. The carrot is for all the bigots that support the Republican party to encourage that support.
The stick is committing violent acts of terrorism against groups they don't like. The stick is for all the people they want to hurt to discourage any pushback.
Whether or not you think it's okay to shoot someone in that situation, we shouldn't forget that Rittenhouse deliberately put himself in that situation. He decided to arm himself and go into the middle of those protests to "protect businesses". He went in willing and ready to kill people for the sake of someone else's property and he followed through on that.
In their mind, being the person who commits these mass killing is the reward. All the motivation and discussion from the right is about culture wars. So when right-wing terrorists commit these acts they think they're saving the world from sin and evil.
Because, here's the thing: No one here is afraid of being killed by a right wing extremist. However, that they are the ones perpetrating all the mass killing is important to note because it shows a trend and belies the narrative coming out of the Right.
