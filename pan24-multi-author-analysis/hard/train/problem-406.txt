People like to complain about inaction with the clean water thing, but there actually is work being done for that if you do some research. A lot of it is behind the scenes and not so publicized, but it is getting better for those communities.
To be fair though, Canada has the third most Ukrainians in the world behind Ukraine (obviously), Russia, and then there's Canada. Ukrainians are also one of the biggest ethnic groups in Canada. And some have family in Ukraine, so it makes perfect sense why Canada would provide so much for a country that has so many connections with Canada.
While the Ukrainian diaspora may be the largest in Canada globally, in Canada itself Ukrainians are the 10th largest ethnic group. A quick search on Wikipedia shows:
"The country's ten largest self-reported specific ethnic or cultural origins in 2021 were Canadian[b] (accounting for 15.6 percent of the population), followed by English (14.7 percent), Irish (12.1 percent), Scottish (12.1 percent), French (11.0 percent), German (8.1 percent), Chinese (4.7 percent), Italian (4.3 percent), Indian (3.7 percent), and Ukrainian (3.5 percent).".
