Look I ain’t going to argue with you but I guess the counterpoint is a guy like desantis. Smarter, more together, has the charisma of a block of wood.
I’m sorry ye, Hitler was a charismatic racist asshole like your buddy trump, but an invented he was not.
I don’t like him, I’m sure you don’t like him, but the fact that he managed to appeal to millions of people means yeah, someone finds that turd charismatic. So yes.
I would agree with that. I think most of these politicians don’t really believe in what they say, just what in will get them votes. Both sides do it, and we deserve better. When Dems controlled the house and senate, they knew SCOTUS was gonna overturn Roe V Wade because of the leak, and they had the votes to send nationally legal abortion to Biden’s desk, and they didn’t. Likewise, when Republicans controlled the senate and house, they could have rammed through some national laws that loosened gun laws, or anything else they campaigned on, but again they didn’t. These people suck, and will only lift their fingers enough to get votes and line their own pockets.
