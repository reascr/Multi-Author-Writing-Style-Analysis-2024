No, he was portrayed as what he was, a rich old white guy, completely out of touch with the reality of average Americans, who rose to power running the type of business that had ruined much of the American economy, barely a year out of the recession.
They were well known and influencing, but look at the 2012 Primary. Santorum, Gingrich and Ron Paul. Main stream republicans hasn't quite gotten to where they are now in the 2012 cycle.
The Tea Party Republicans were the ones who started the radical republican trope, and they were getting elected to their first terms in 2010/2012, and didn't start trying for president until the 2016 cycle.
He didn’t deserve the radical conservative label back in 2012, just like Obama didn’t deserve the communist label being thrown at him during his election years either. I certainly preferred Obama, but a Romney presidency would’ve been okay, and I’d definitely prefer it to the shit show we’ve witnessed from 2016-present.
(I'll probably hold my nose and vote D, anyway, but the two major parties really need better candidates).
If he doesn’t run for re-election I’d like to see him in the Cabinet. He wanted to be Secretary of State but Biden probably has binders full of candidates that he has deep connections with, so that wouldn’t work.
