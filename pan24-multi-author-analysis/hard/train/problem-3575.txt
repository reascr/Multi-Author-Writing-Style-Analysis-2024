The formation of central banking and the formation of joint stock companies go hand in hand. “Central banking” did not exist in its current or any representative matter prior to the expansion of global imperialism and trade, especially after the turn of the center to help facilitate monetary policy. itself has an online article about this. This is capitalism for sure.
Can capitalism be bad? Yes, absolutely with no constraints. But government assistance can be just as selfish in nature. Why are you acting like there were zero strings attached to the Marshall plan? The US government totally passed this plan without thinking about how it would effectively create a new market for mature American companies. They totally also didn’t want to maintain presence in Europe to slow down the Soviet’s either. Even today, the American government sees a chance to knock down Russia another notch and they don’t have to lose any American life’s to do it. America isn’t there because they care about Ukraine. It’s pure geopolitics. Nothing is selfless in business or government.
That’s how the real world works. If post invasion they intend to rebuild, black rock is one of the few players who can pump Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of capital.
I'd much rather governments lend the money to Ukraine to rebuild in stead of some crusty old billionaire taking all the spoils once again.
Yes, I'd rather Ukraine get money from governments than private equity. That is my main point. Ukraine will never get money for free, but getting money from a sovereign country with its own currency (ex. US) has a higher chance for better terms and the possibility of debt forgiveness/cancellation in the future. It also (in theory) means you can avoid some of the issues I mentioned with private bailouts: a foreign government can't necessarily impose terms forcing you to privatize public goods, nor can it create local monopolies for itself.
