>	The missile buy would boost Japan’s long-range strike capability and mark a stunning break with a long tradition of eschewing offensive weapons. And it would enhance Japan’s conventional deterrent as China undertakes a sweeping military modernization and North Korea barrels ahead with its nuclear program.
sounds like China needs to increase their nuclear arsenal to counter this threat, and update their nuclear policy. Possibly getting rid of the no first use policy.
well, that's the 2nd clause to the no-first-use policy. The first part is that China won't be the first to launch first. So I would assume that if there is even talk of nuking Japan, nuclear war has broken out between the US and China.
China can try taking Taiwan if they would like, but they'd just lose a bunch of boats to missile strikes, there's really no way that escalates into WW3 because China doesn't have enough nukes to win a nuclear war. They have enough nukes to make it too painful for the USA to start a nuclear war, but at the end of a nuclear exchange America would still exist as a country and China wouldn't. So a war over Taiwan would be almost certain to stay conventional. Also, Japan having more missiles makes it less likely that China is willing to invade the island, not more likely.
Once japan gets these missiles, china wouldnt stand a chance if japan decides it wants china. China would be forced into a defensive war and would slowly lose all of their territory.
