> Hours later, at around 9:00 p.m. on the same day, a second package addressed to the Instalaza de Zaragoza arms company was detected. The company sent grenade launchers to Ukraine under the Russian invasion. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist Technician (TEDAX) carried out a controlled detonation.
Spain has always had them, we had a fascist dictatorship until the mid 70s and it just finished with Franco dying of old age, the fascists were and are still around.
I was surprised to see how many fascist sympathizing groups are active in Spain and Italy, organized fascist groups. People need to remember Spain was under a dictatorship for many years, they were neutral in WWII, democracy is rather modern and relatively a “new” concept.
I was wondering why this wasn’t a bigger headline in international news. It’s been like an afterthought, I think this is quite significant.
If it is Russia out of all the HV targets. Why in Spain? Spain has had limited participation. Why not attack the US or German Embassy in Madrid instead of the Ukraine office? Spain isn’t even taking in as many refugees. Also, the opposition parties really dislike Pedro Sanchez, the last envelope was directed to his office.
Neo-fascists in Spain are pretty aggressive.They are very vocal, they take advantage of their freedom of speech. They have had political leaders going on TV literally saying they are proud fascist, ultra right philosophy.
Like the rest of Europe, our far-right is directly connected to Russia, so there're probably enough fascists morons that would love to do this.
The only people that I have seen to be remotely close to that are the literal fascists who loved Putin's strongman stance but immediately jumped the boat as soon as Russia found no support from any other country.
