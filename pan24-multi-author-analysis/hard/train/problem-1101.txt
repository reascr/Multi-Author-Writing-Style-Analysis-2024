This is the exact reason why the death penalty should always be reserved for the most heinous crimes, and perhaps not even for them. You never want to encourage a criminal to kill witnesses of minor crimes to reduce their chances of arrest and execution.
Agreed. Where I'm from people care more about saving money than getting their hate boners on. IIRC a life sentence is cheaper than the insane process of review and appeal and waiting that comes with a reliable system to rule out killing innocent people.
There is no possible system made by humans who are fallible that could have a 100% accuracy rate with respect to death penalty convictions. It’s not nearly as simple as you are making it sound or as you want it to be.
Except they are human, they are some of humanity’s worst but describing them as inhuman is just a subconscious means to justify killing them. And even when the death penalty has been extremely hard to grant, there have still been innocent people mistakenly put to death. It’s better to not risk killing even one innocent person.
The only thing that stops me from killing people every day is the risk of getting punished for it. And i'm just talking about, like, when someone neglects to use their blinker when changing lanes in front of me.
