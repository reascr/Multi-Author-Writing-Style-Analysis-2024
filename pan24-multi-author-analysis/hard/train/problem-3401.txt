I actually think that given the actual events that happened that night, if it were a black 17 year old at a proud boys riot, and the exact same thing happened, one of two things would have happened. First, I think it would be far more likely that the police would have fired on a black kid approaching them with a rifle.
If he wasn't shot by the police however, I can't see a black kid in the exact same situation even being charged with a crime. The optics of a black kid shooting a violent felon charging at him, and the of that felon's buddy and buddy's wife whipping up a crowd of white people to chase a fleeing black teenager would be too much.
It was Veteran's Day, I assume the old ass judge does that every year. He was surprised there were no Veteran's in the courtroom and remembered that John Black was a veteran. He probably gives a round of applause to Veterans' in court every year. Sure it's sloppy, but I don't think that pushed the needle towards acquittal at all.
I could maybe see an argument where this piece of shit doesn’t deserve to spend some time in prison. But the fact that he’s propped up as a hero proves one crucial thing: conservatives never cared if he was innocent or not. They like that he killed civil rights protesters. Conservatives have always liked killing civil rights protestors.
