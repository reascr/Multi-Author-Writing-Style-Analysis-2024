Israel rejects proposals where they withdraw behind the international accepted 1967 border, but rather does the war crime of settlers and cleansing of Palestinians in chosen parts. I'd say Israel rejects the reasonable two state solution.
Again, Mr. Necro post, Israel doesn't want a Palestine state. Why? Because then they can't get away with stealing Palestinian land.
You mean the bogus offers where Israel still retains control over land that is Palestinian land? You mean the bogus offers where Palestine is just a country in name only, with Israel controlling it's land, sea and air borders? Or how Israel would have literal veto power over any Palestine legislature?
Even if you're right about why Palestinians rejected the two state solution in 1947, why have they rejected it all 8 times it's been offered to them since then?
And you do realize that "all 8 times" the agreement was always one sided in favor of Israel and extremely limiting for a state of Palestine, right? It doesn't return any of the land that Israel has stolen; it heavily limits their military; Israel has full control over their land, sea and air... essentially not actually an independent state, but a vassal.
Israel exists officially as a country & is recognized by the UN (just like the US is, which stole all of its land from the natives). Much of Israel already had Jews living in the region before its official formation, unlike America.
