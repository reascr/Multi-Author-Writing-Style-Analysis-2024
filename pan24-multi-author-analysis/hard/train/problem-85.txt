Your last sentence and first leave out some important context and may give the wrong impression imo, even though what you're saying is all correct. The reason the Soviet Invasion was the last straw was because a negotiated surrender to the West backed by the Soviets was Japan's last hope to avoid unconditional surrender. It wasn't that they were afraid of the Soviets or that this was what tipped the scales on the battlefield, it was as much a diplomatic blow as anything else.
But in reality the Russians weren't in a strong position to invade Japan after getting the Germans out of Russia. And the impact of those bombs was truly enormous psychologically.
Unfortunately, the destructive power of bombs has also come a long way since WW2. Normal explosive nukes aren't enough to end the world, but salted warheads definitely could. No one has really been crazy enough to build salted warheads, but theoretically, a barrage of a few hundred of those would make Ukraine glow blue for the next hundred years. Even resistance fighters in underground redoubts would be stuck and left to starve because they can't leave for fear of the radiation.
Of course, anyone using salted warheads would be promptly wiped off the face of earth by everyone else. Normal nukes are bad enough, no one wants someone actually using a potential world-ender to continue existing.
The issue is that either you use strategic nuclear barrages (not just piddly 'tactical' nukes), salted warheads, the other spokes of the NBC triad...
Arguably, the last time a determined extermination campaign was conducted by bombing was against Japan in WW2, even Vietnam wasn't at the same level. Russia's bombing campaign is an asthmatic wheeze compared to raids like Dresden.
