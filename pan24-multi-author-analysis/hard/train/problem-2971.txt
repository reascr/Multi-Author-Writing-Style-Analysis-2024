Mindful of the failures of the League of Nations in the 1920s, where powerful member states would walk away from the coalition whenever it limited their ability to act on the world stage, the UN Security Council with it 5 permanent members was created not to promote peace but to solidify the power structure of the world to align with the Victors of WWII; who provide the lion's share of support to maintain the institution.
Without the Permanent Members of the Security Council, there would never have been a United Nations.
It should still be possible for a qualified minority to block things in the Security Council, just not by individual states. From my perspective, it's time the UK lost its permanent seat. India has nukes, more than 15 times the UK's population, and now has a higher GDP than the UK. Maybe not time quite yet to consign the UK to the dung heap of history, but past time to treat it as the minor power which it has become, in no small part due to its own unwavering incompetence.
Change the rules so that it takes 2 permanent members and at least 3 other members of the Security Council to reject proposals put before the Security Council.
At most I'd exchange India for the UK. Too many permanent members would make the Security Council unwieldy. OTOH, giving the General Assembly the power to override a single nation's veto with, maybe, a 75% supermajority.
There are 2 other NATO members which are permanent members of the Security Council: US and France. UK is unnecessary. UK is also the world's most rapidly declining former great power thanks to Brexit and the inanity of the recent 5 Conservative governments.
