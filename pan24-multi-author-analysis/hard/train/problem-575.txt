It's not sacrilege, it's just dumb and politically illiterate. What is the process of confirming a supreme court judge friend? When did the Democrats have more than 60 votes in the last 20 years? Should the Democrats have extended the "nuclear option" to supreme court picks themselves and forced someone through in 2010?
How many democratic votes did that Senate have? Should the Democrats have extended the "nuclear option" to supreme court picks themselves in 2012? The idiocy in this thread is absolutely overwhelming.
When should she have retired? If she had retired during Obama's presidency for example, what would have likely happened? When did Obama have a 60 vote majority? And keep in mind that before Kavanaugh no supreme court justice had been confirmed without 60 votes for at least 40 years. You can look back in hindsight and say the Democrats should have extended the "nuclear option" to supreme court picks, but I think they lose pretty much all the moral high ground at that point.
Lol, the political illiteracy is real. When did the standard change for supreme court nominees, and which party affected the change? Was the change good or bad overall for democracy do you think?
Well yeah that’s the point of democracy. If you don’t vote then you don’t get a say in what happens. Jesus Christ, do you not understand how your system works? You can’t fucking complain about republicans and shit laws and then not even bother voting and pretend like you aren’t the problem.
