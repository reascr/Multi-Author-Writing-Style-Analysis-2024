What I can't grasp and understand is why they believe the western world is against them? Ever since the fall of the soviet Union the Western world and in particular Europe has tried to basically become friends with Russia...
But not one single European country have been even remotely close to have aspirations to invade Russia?
The very existence of Western leaning, democratic Ukraine on Russia's border is an existential threat to Putin's regime.
The biggest miscommunication is the West giving mixed signals about how they feel about Russia invading Ukraine pre-war allowing Putin to think he could get away with it.
Not stating the obvious truth (as you correctly stated above) is basically part of the same strategy as not giving Ukraine weapons to attack Moscow. If Moscow could see the future theyâ€™d probably use their nukes now. So the strategy is to keep them focused on Ukraine and keep support at a level at where, if Russia escalates, Russia is seen as dragging other countries into the war, not other countries jumping on Russia. This makes the political messaging and support at home much much easier to manage. And in the mean time, help Ukraine help Russia destroy itself.
