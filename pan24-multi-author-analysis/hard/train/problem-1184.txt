As a result, Republicans were no longer able to draw egregiously gerrymandered maps that guaranteed their victories. The commission instead drew a map that was fair to both parties. As a result, Democrats were able to win control of the legislature for the first time in four decades!
This will be the first time since 1984 that Democrats will control the state legislature in Michigan! And it’s important to note that this only happened because in 2018, voters in Michigan approved a citizen-initiated ballot referendum that transferred the power to draw voting maps from the state legislature to an independent redistricting commission.
The problem is that the amendment that passed in Ohio still gave the state’s legislature power over redistricting where as Michigan took away that power and gave it to an independent commission.
Other states could use Michigan as a road map, but not every state constitution allows for constitutional amendments via direct democracy. If we had to rely on the state legislature to get this done, none of it would have been possible.
Now we know that it's necessary to do so rather than write rules that they want the legislature to follow.
The districts as drawn by the commission have a slight republican favor just due to the natural sort of geographic sorting of people, right?
