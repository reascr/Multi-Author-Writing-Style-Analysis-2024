My understanding is that it’s a little pellet that gets injected that’s super similar to subs, but lasts way longer. usually done once a month, but I’ve known guys who still feel fine 45 days after a shot.
I think what they’re talking about here is people who are intending to do coke or mdma and end up having stuff cut with fentanyl and OD as a result.
I know people are worried their other drugs are laced with fentanyl, they even test the drugs for fentanyl before consuming. I could see someone wanting the vaccine so they don't die from a OD from consuming drugs laced with it without their knowledge.
I'm for a fentanyl vaccine but I don't think it's gonna help addicts as much as ppl think. Addicts are the demand and trust me the current conglomerate of narco states have plenty of supply and ways to make it even deadlier for the average user. We need safe injecting sites, needle exchanges and a ton more methadone/Suboxone clinics if we want to make a dent in the current opioid crisis.
There are plenty of less commonly used ultra potent Opioids that can be used for pain relief/sedation.
Opioids users tolerances are so high at this point, Heroin alone would likely not even work for them. Plus the false confidence that they are immune to ultra potent Opioids when that isn’t the case with Nitazenes becoming widely available.
I should have been clear that I was speaking in the context that replacements are already available and don’t have to be discovered, not that Opioids in the Benzimidazole class can be an immediate replacement. You are correct that they obviously need FDA approval.
