They are like the CIA/NSA but very very serious. Israel is surrounded by countries that want it dead. So it has resources and Intent, the will do to what peacetime countries might be reluctant to do. so maybe like WW2 MI5 in the UK.
They spent a lot of time hunting nazi's around the world, and assassinated a load of people after the munich olympics.
Just gonna hijack how high up this is to mention Mossad used to employ Nazi Hunters. I still think the idea that there was an entire, albeit small, group of dedicated folks hunting former Nazis across the globe is so fucking interesting. That said the demand for the job has declined in the last 35 years for obvious reasons.
Actually some prominent Nazis were brought back to Israel and convicted. It’s not a huge number to brag about but they got a few high ranking officials. Other times they just killed them as far as i aware but i could definitely be wrong.
For me it’s the analytic nature. It really is just a meeting for an hr and a half but i still can never get over the fact that it happened. These men really decided the direct fate of millions and indirectly countless more. Even more appalling is how they were just numbers and it was approached in such a business like manner. The extermination of a people was debated over wine and cigarettes.
Edit: since im getting a lot of comments about movies and what not I figured id link an interesting HBO movie from 2001 that is about the German Final Solution and how it was deliberated. It has a fantastic cast and was informative to say the least. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject.
I said it in other comments but i will repeat it as much as needed. I am no fan of Israel. I just find the Nazi Hunters and the idea of it as a profession very fascinating. I understand Mossad and Israel have a nuanced history. I want to avoid that discussion here because frankly it’s unrelated and I am woefully ignorant of the illegal antics the Israelís find themselves in.
