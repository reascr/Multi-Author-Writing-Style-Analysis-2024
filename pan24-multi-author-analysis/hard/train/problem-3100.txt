The thing you have to realize is, the consequences of telling the truth may, and likely reach far beyond the possibility of criminal charges of this investigation.
Iâ€™m awareâ€¦weâ€™re discussing potential consequences of lying to the grand jury and how someone would get charged as a result. Itâ€™s hilarious that youâ€™re all trying to explain this to me when itâ€™s my literal job ðŸ˜‚.
By they I meant the Georgia prosecutor. They convened the grand jury and would issue a perjury charge for lying in front of it. Nothing to do with federal court as the person I replied to said it was.
Edit for clarity. They = the prosecutor. They convened the grand jury and would charge someone for lying in front of it. And as Iâ€™ve said local prosecutors donâ€™t need anything beyond probable cause to issue a charge. Pretty basic criminal procedure stuff here.
This isnâ€™t federal courtâ€¦itâ€™s a county in Georgia and their local prosecutor who convened a grand jury. Theyâ€™d be the same one issuing any perjury charge.
No, it more likely means that Willis is not planning to pursue indictments for these perjury allegations. The reason she argued against releasing the report is because having it made public before she indicts people could screw up her cases in annoying and technical ways (prejudice juries, open avenues for appeal, etc.) However, the grand jury voted to make the report public, so the judge wanted to publicize as much of it as possible as soon as possible, to honor the letter of the law that says that the grand jury has the power to publicize their report. So the compromise is to release the parts of the report that don't directly discuss the charges Willis is going to bring. Which in turn means that anything that is discussed in the portions that are about to be released is likely to be stuff that no one's planning to use in an indictment.
