It's time for NATO to carry out offensive cyberattacks against Russia. Russia has been cyber-attacking NATO countries for years and NATO does nothing. It's time to deter those assholes. Shut down Russia's power grid or something.
Look at what attacks on the Ukrainian power grid do for the resolve of their citizens. The reverse is also possible.
It's also very unclear where any countries red lines are on cyber attacks that cause physical damage. If Russia shut down the US power grid would this be considered an act of war? What if the US did the same to Russia?
The US has some very good intelligence sources on Russia. It's safe to assume shutting off the power to Moscow would also hurt the ability of the US to collect intelligence. This could be very vital intelligence in terms of something like Russia's willingness to use nukes. On the subject of nukes we don't know what cyber or other electronic warfare capabilities exist to prevent them from being launched in the first place, or reaching their intended target after launching.
