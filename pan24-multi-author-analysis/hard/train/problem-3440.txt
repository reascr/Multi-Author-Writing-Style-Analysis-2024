Right, this and other public messages are targeted towards the foreign public, not Russians or Ukrainians or foreign leaders.
At least this should give second thoughts to the Russian-aligned members of Russian-speaking enclaves in other Eastern European and Baltic countries.
Not arguing with you, just clarifying the “former Soviet states” wanted nothing to do with Russia then or now and Russia has no claim over them in any way.
Of course, some will say "Russia doesn't see them as sovereign, despite the official breakup of the USSR", but as a matter of international law, that's not a valid view.
I got a kick out of that. I have no idea how a country that is invading a sovereign neighbor, who made no aggressive moves toward them, is in any way justified in complaining about the aggression of the defending armed forces.
Others will point to Ukraine's constitutionally mandated aspiration to join NATO as a provocation, but that's still BS, because all they have to do is... not do anything to provoke NATO.
