Well the two capitals are about 1,700 miles distant. They might have to go around Iran or what ever country KSA has a problem with. Pakistan would need several transports. Have the crew rested and briefed, with the planes working. Remove the bombs from the arsenal and into the transports. Probably at night, to reduce the likliehood of being caught on spy satellites. Probably with a fighter escort........Moving nukes isn't quite as easy as moving luggage.
Does Israel officially have nukes? Did South Africa ever officially have nukes, whilst they still had them?
Saudi lives subcontracting for thing. They didn't send Saudi troops to Bosnia to protect the Bosnian Muslims. They just sent a few mercenaries. This way KSA has nukes but doesnt have the political and environmental costs of having them.
Maybe they would have enough money if they didnt waste it on nuclear weapons that will never be used.
What does a nuclear weapon have to do with disastrous economic decisions? If anything itâ€™s an expensive saber that you rattle too much. We need a better economic policy than war.
