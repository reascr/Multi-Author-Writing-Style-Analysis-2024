Similarly, if a bakery doesn't want to bake a wedding cake for a LGTBQ+ couple then they shouldn't be sued into doing so. I wouldn't want them spitting in the cake batter personally... Just move on to the next bakery that will do it and leave a negative Yelp review or whatever for the other business.
I consider myself to be a LGTBQ+ ally. This is something that I agree with and believe is a great compromise. A church shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want to - a priest shouldn't be forced to perform a homosexual marriage ceremony if they don't want to because it infringes upon their personal beliefs. But the very next priest or church who has no problem marrying a gay couple should be the one to do so.
This means that the church can’t force priest who don’t want to marry gay couples, but you can still ask another priest and they will gladly do it.
So the church is fine with the gay marriage and didn't want to oppose its priest's beliefs? I don't see anything wrong with that. Just find another priest that actually wants to do the wedding.
Why would you want to get married, officiated by the church. For hundreds of years, they have persecuted LGBTQ.
