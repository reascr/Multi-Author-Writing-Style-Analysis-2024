I'm an Israeli and I thinkt the title is a bit misleading. Recognizing the Palestinian Nakba doesn't necessarily mean calling the founding of Israel a catastrophe. The Nakba refers to the mass displacement of Palestinians following the war between the Jewish and Arab communities of Palestine/Israel. When many people become refugees, it's a catastrophe for them. No matter which side you believe had a more righteous cause, or bore more responsibility for the end result, it is a catastrophe nevertheless for Palestinians. Therefore, it would be more accurate to say that the UN passed a resolution recognizing the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem as a catastrophe.
This is about the day after Israel's founding, that Palestinians marks as a day of catastrophe to commemorate the displacement of 700.000 Palestinians.
The Nakba refers more to the fact that the Palestinian homeland was destroyed in 1948, about 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, and over 500 Palestinian villages were destroyed. I'd call that a national catastrophe too, if I were Palestinian. Wouldn't you?
