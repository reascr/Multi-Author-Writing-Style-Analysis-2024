Trembling Putin goes to the Kremlin barbershop to get a haircut. While cutting his hair, the barber keeps on and on asking and talking about the 'special operation' in Ukraine.
A stressed out and trembling Putin goes to the Kremlin barbershop to get a haircut. While cutting his hair, the barber keeps asking on and on and talking about the 'special operation' in Ukraine.
The barber responds, "Nyet. I'm not interested at all about the war crimes. I don't care about the massacres, the rape, the bombing of civilians. Couldn't care less.".
Putin gets angry, grabs the chair handles and starts to shake even more and says "You seem to be overly interested about the fate of Ukraine... Don't you understand what happens to people who are too nosy here in Russia? Do you want to fall from a fifth floor window? Do you want to be poisoned with a nerve agent like Alexei Navalny? Or shot dead in front of the Kremlin like Boris Nemtsov???
What? Are we talking about the same guy? He ALWAYS has some more bullshit to say. Whether its empty threats or fabricated excuses, like late night adds, “But wait, there’s more!”.
