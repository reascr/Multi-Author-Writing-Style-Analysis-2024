Yeah. While the young demographic is one of the most Democratic leaning bases, it's also one of the most apathetic groups with typically low turnout. Biden really needs to energize the youth vote any way he can if he or any other Dem wants to win in 2024.
Its a loss for Biden, Democrats need working class rural Democrats to vote in the 2024 elections and every election after. These are primarily people who couldnt afford to go to college even with loans. The left brutally attacked rural communities said they were coming after their jobs and their guns and their bla bla bla. A good way to suppress the Democratic vote in rural regions is to make people who are living hand to mouth pay for your bloated college expenses so you can buy a house while they struggle to pay rent.
Biden as a candidate lost before he even ran, The only reason hes in the Whitehouse is because people were sick and tired of Trump. Biden is not being reelected to a second term, and history is not going to look back on his presidency.
Biden has doubled down on his commitment to ban guns which lost Democrats the House and stacked state legislatures with Republicans. Hes double down on his student loan forgiveness plan which benefits primarily the children of wealthy families, Biden being the one who helped create the problem in the first place by voting against student loan bankruptcy protection in 2005...and hes right now taking action against rail workers who only want a weeks worth of sick days.
