EDIT - I guess there is real evidence that he has been good at golf and yet still cheats and falsifies records. I admit it has not crossed my particular leftist news feed. I am still amazed he doesn't use more visuals of him golfing, but I guess I am not in the right demographic to see them.
These type of golf outing are not uncommon for him and I do not believe any of them are coincidental.
I am of the firm opinion that DJT plays golf because it's a very expected activity that raises zero red flags. On the golf courses he owns/controls, law enforcement can't easily sneak close by. Wide open space, no prying eyes or ears close by. No listening devices. It's almost perfect to have sensitive conversations you want remaining secret.
DJT learned a lot of his tactics early in his career from mafia lawyers. Two mafia people travel out to the pine forest, an abandoned warehouse district or other secluded area for privacy... It raises all sorts of red flags. DJT goes out for a round of golf on his course with Lindsay Graham, he can say whatever he wants without repercussions or fear of it getting out. Suddenly the next day Lindsay Graham flips to full support of DJT. Or when he met with about 10 people for a round of golf earlier this year, but they just walked around talking and no one had golf clubs.
