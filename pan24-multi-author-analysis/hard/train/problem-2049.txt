Depends on the candidates. She’d likely take anywhere from 5-10% of the vote. If Gallego runs, maybe closer to 5 or below, if a less popular D runs, maybe closer to 10 or above.
If Blake Masters, or somebody similar runs, he stands a great chance. He wins the 7th district with 75% of the vote already, which is downtown Phoenix, a population center. He’d likely win Maricopa, which is a good start. Depends on who the GOP would run against him though.
She’ll get some Dems, but not many. Same with GOP. She’ll probably get most of the votes from center-right independents/disaffected Republicans. If it’s a less popular candidate for D, she’ll probably pull more D than if Gallego runs for Senate. I think I saw that a poll had them 84/16 leaning Gallego in an article I read? Some Dems still support her. Possibly enough to run the margins against Gallego and allow a GOP seat gain, but we’ll have to see.
If the Republicans run another Finchem/Blake/Lake and the Dems run Gallego then honestly Sinema probably wins….
There’s a real chance that she can win a three way race between a regular Democrat and whatever batshit crank the GOP nominates. It’s also possible that she takes more votes from the Dem and elects a MAGA clown shoe.
In a three way race she’s only need 34%of the vote. Trump had negative net approval for his entire term and got the second highest vote total ever and lost the electoral college by razor thin margins in AZ, GA and WI.
