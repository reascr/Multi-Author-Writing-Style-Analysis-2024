I hate how obvious this is but most people don’t want to admit it, also the reason why you see Christian nationalism blamed more than white supremacy when we all know what’s more common amongst right wing extremists. Also you don’t have to be religious to be homophobic.
So why are there a ton of articles out exclusively highlighting religion as their motivation by the major news outlets but minimal focusing on pure white supremacy? All I ever see at most is “White Christian Nationalism.” That is purposefully disingenuous. Something stinks.
Which is why we just need to lead with white supremacy because that is absolutely being lost to a ton of people when described as “Christian Nationalism”.
Christian Nationalists, at this point, are white supremacists. Religion is, and always has been, a tool of oppression by way of getting followers to obey at the threat of "the other".
They'll have fuckin talks about when it should have been used in the past and what Democrat presidents were actually terrorists while in office... They'll try to find a way to label Biden's son a Terrorist. They'll call Hillary a Terrorist.
