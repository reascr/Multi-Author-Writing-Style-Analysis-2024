How unscientific of you. You know that half of all humans are women right? That simplifies this quite a bit. So if a bunch of highly paid male neurosurgeons force otherwise qualified women to work in fast food instead of making up half the surgeon workforce, then clearly thatâ€™s a wage gap and sexist as hell, kind of like your comment.
Of course a full time neurosurgeon is going to outearn a part time fast food worker, no matter the gender.
If a qualified neurosurgeon is unable to find a job BECAUSE of her gender, that is a problem. If there are just no positions and both men and women are facing the same problem, then it isn't sexism or wage gap, it is a different problem altogether.
However if an in depth analysis is performed and a gendered wage gap is found within equal work scenarios, then that should be eliminated. Gender should never be a factor for employment or wages.
Another thing to consider on hourly wage. Even if you adjust for hours worked, you may still get discrepancies owing to scheduling. Men may be able to fit their schedule to the company's needs, while women may not be able to, which would reflect in the hourly wage.
