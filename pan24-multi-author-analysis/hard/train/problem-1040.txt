I hate how much Iâ€™ve seen the 4x10 get talked about. No amount of extra day off is going to make me any more productive when working a 10-hour day.
In the UK a full time work week is a minimum of 35 hours, and if you worked 9-5 Monday to Friday it would be 7 hours a day plus an hour unpaid break.
The impression I got from my limited time in Sweden is people worked hard during the office hours and more generally arrived and left on time rather than putting unofficial hours in.
So 4 x 7 is exactly what was trialled here. It was four seven hour days with an hour unpaid lunch. So it's 32 hours if you count "time spent at physically work" but 28 hours if you count "time paid to be working".
What's more common is for people to take a week off at a time, maybe 2 weeks if they are going abroad. And then the rest of the time is just days here and there when they need it, plus public holidays.
"These studies show that hunter-gatherers need only work about fifteen to twenty hours a week in order to survive and may devote the rest of their time to leisure. Lee did not include food preparation time in his study, arguing that "work" should be defined as the time spent gathering enough food for sustenance.".
Yup. When I only have to go to my job 4 days a week (say Monday or Friday are holidays), I'm so much more motivated and interested in my job that week. Having only two days off per week to live your life can be a soul crusher.
