So somehow you're now following right-wingers or is it that right-winger posts are being presented in your feed without having been retweeted by someone you follow?
I'm hoping he sells Twitter before Summer comes. Twitter is a fantastic platform for communities. I'd hate to see it get shut down. A lot of acquaintances, friendships, careers, and even marriages happened because of Twitter. A lot of BS has happened via Twitter as well.
It's all publicity and everyone is talking about Twitter. It might be rough but individual user usage is up, interactions are up, the news and many media outlets are posting and talking about Twitter. It's a gambit that may pay off in the long run. Because we humans like people that change. The villain that sees his evil ways and comes to the side of good.
It seems like that is the route Twitter is taking and I might be wrong but right now Twitter is on everyone's mind so the marketing is working.
Things like that should keep twitter alive but as long as it's hemorrhaging money and showing the world what an asshole musk is that's not too bad eh?
