I think people greatly underestimate the effort ahead. Liberating the territory stolen since February is going to be hard. Liberating Luhansk and Donbass are going to be brutal but likely if things continue as they are. Not sure how they liberate Crimea, it should be extremely defensible, with only a very narrow approaches to attack... Hope they do liberate all of Ukraine, but I think it is very early to talk about counter attacking into actual Russian territory.
However it remains a possibility and unless Ukraine has the resolve and capacity to push Russian forces back from all the annexed land, or think they can somehow force Putin to conceded...they might just have to take it.
Once the land connecting Crimea to mainland is under Ukrainian control, it's game over in Crimea because Russia can't supply the army there, while Ukraine has a direct supply route.
And as far as I understand it, Crimea is really hard to defend as soon as the land bridge to Russia is cut off. It's essentially impossible to resupply. And considering the piss poor state of the Russian armed forces...
You mean occupied territory right? Not actual Russian territory? Crimea, Luhansk, and Donbass are Ukrainian territory.
This is a good source of information, regarding Crimea. This guys name is William Spaniel, and he's got a lot of really solid informational videos about the war in Ukraine.
