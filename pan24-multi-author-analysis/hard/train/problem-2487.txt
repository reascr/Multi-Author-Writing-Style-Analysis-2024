The generic party vote is likely to end up around Rep +2%, but them only taking +1% of the House seats. There were more uncontested Republicans than Democrats and where Republicans did solidly better than expected was in areas where they either still didn't win or they were already expected to win.
Their A- rating comes from having pretty good precision, even if they have a strong bias. Being exactly X points to the right on every poll can still be useful as long as you adjust for that bias, which 538 does.
And 538 also made it clear that a lot of possible outcomes around the balance if power were all within one normal polling error.
Polls donâ€™t predict winners since a margin of error of 3% with one candidate leading by 3% just means the have a really excellent chance of being in the range of losing by by 3% or winning by 9%.
I answered two poll calls before my primary since my caller ID indicated they were polling organizations. Unfortunately one was a push poll intended to find out how to make people hate the Democrat. I answered a few questions on that one before the intent became obvious and I hung up.
