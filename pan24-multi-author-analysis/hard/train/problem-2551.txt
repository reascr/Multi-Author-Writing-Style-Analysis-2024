I can easily see a situation where an employee accumulates a ton of overtime to the point where they can take several weeks off in a row. That could lead to some serious issues down the line if a critical employee suddenly takes the next two months off.
I think it's a trait about Democrats at this point that about 80% of what they accomplish is boring keep the country running stuff, and most of their meaningful outcomes can't be fully recognized for years to come.
It comes to the point that politics in how its structured doesn't even benefit the american people, so it's only logical politicians focuses on their own benefit instead. Wanna know why corruption exists? Too easy to erase progress, a lot of would be non crooks don't see the point. Not justified, but I do think it's human nature for a noticeable majority of people when the opportunity arises.
The economy is shit, people on Reddit are just young and don't remember the world before 2008. It comes to a point people form their standards on averages, not what should actually be the case.
Yeah, Biden did a good job doing something, but I don't know if it honestly made a difference in my life. I still have high rent that wont go down and I have more expensive groceries. They haven't fixed that, they basically did their job preventing it from getting significantly worse and we act like they're hard working heroes for it.
I just spent $5 on a taco. It was only four years ago my friends and I were shocked when they sell for $3.50. It had to be a really fucking good taco to justify $3.50. Now $5 is sorta expected. Meanwhile I still can only get a job that pays around $12 and my rent went up by a hundred dollars a month. Nah, my pay hasn't changed by my expenses sure have, I feel like this isn't an unsual thing to say either, I don't think my case is uncommon. I feel like this data generously padded itself with taking into account the social elite that was able to buy shares at a discount.
