That phrasing he used is something folks are doing to focus on for the wrong reason. All conventional firearm training I'm aware of is to treat all firearms as deadly, as loaded unless opened and likely with one of those "chamber is clear" flags. To never point at anything you don't intend to kill. That shooting is to be deadly.
If a gun is drawn, then it's become a deadly force scenario. I really don't see the point in shooting to injure, there is already less lethal devices for that purpose. Besides, shooting a torso is easier than an arm or leg. So I don't see the point. You either use less lethal means or shoot to kill, because once guns are drawn there usually is no going back. That's why officers should be trained to properly be able to assess the need for deadly force use.
If an officer is drawing a gun, then it's deadly force. I would expect that prior to drawing a weapon, de escalation was at least attempted, but the scenario dictates.
Anyone who requires the use of lethal force should be fired on until they are no longer an active threat.
That's the point of shooting. You don't stop until the target is incapacitated/dead. That is what I expect. Has zero to do with "trigger happy.".
Bingo! That's exactly what I'm saying. We can't effectively change what happens once the decision to pull the trigger is made. It's everything leading up to that we should focus on.
