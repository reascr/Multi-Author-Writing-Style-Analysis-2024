Fuck me sideways and call me Frank. How the fuck is this a thing in Queensland?! Only positive thing is that we will do a review and if there are changes to the laws to help avoid this in the future, then they will be considered. We're not America. We tend to take cop killing pretty seriously.
But I’m their twisted logic would have thought the cops were coming to kill them or imprison them. I dunno. There’s threads showing how insane and batshit crazy Gareth Train (property owner) was about QAnon, NWO, and China stuff.
We are definitely not perfect and need to continue on improving our mental health services, education systems, and reduce the impacts of social issues.
The missing person (also a shooter) was a primary school principal a couple of years ago. Allegedly he has a heart issue and was asked to stop working sometime in 2020, his mental health spiralled. Then his brother, one of the other shooters, was deep into conspiracies. The Missing person/principal became very engaged in QAnon and other nutter conspiracies which lead to him disengaging with his family (hence the missing persons report). So they likely had some idea the cops were looking for him.
