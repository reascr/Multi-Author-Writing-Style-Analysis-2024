As it appears to me the GOP is part of strategic influence campaign to create the image of new gained omnipotence. It is more about image and an attempt to change the wave to their favor. I say just vote.
Fuck the polls, go and vote! Bonus fucking points if you can get someone else to vote, who may not vote otherwise.
I wouldn’t trust any poll right now because D or R money could be pushing numbers meant to discourage particular voters.
If anyone is wondering why Billionare Republicans would out money in biased polling, heres my theories.
Lol I never claimed it’s a conspiracy, I’m just questioning the accuracy of the polling trend. Maybe it’s real, maybe it’s not, we’ll see. I know things tend to tighten closer to the election, but there have been massive, abrupt shifts in almost close race across very different states, all towards the GOP. And it’s a fact, not conspiracy, that a lot of the recent polls come from partisan pollsters. No need to tell me to “wake up” haha, I’m not making any wild accusations.
