The "Pakistani Taliban" (aka TTP) and "The Taliban" are two different organisations (it's confusing I know). The Taliban have criticised TTP in the past such as over the infamous 2014 Peshawar school massacre.
TTP even tried to pledge allegiance to Afghanistan earlier this year only for The Taliban to publically reject them.
Generally The Taliban was/is willing to accept TTPs aid in Afghanistan, while denouncing TTPs actions and attacks in Pakistan.
The Afghani Taliban had to soften its stance on some things to be considered a viable national government to Afghanistan that would actually be recognized and traded with. A version that can never hope to aspire to anything but terrorism does not need to do that.
Not really accurate. The US did supply arms to anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan but those rebels' values reflected what a lot of the population already felt. A large supply of high-tech weapons can only go so far without soldiers willing to carry them. Also, a lot of those soldiers came from Islamic nations outside of Afghanistan. Also, China also helped the Afghan rebels as by that time they had fallen out with Soviets. In sum, to say the US is uniquely responsible for the Taliban is fallacy.
