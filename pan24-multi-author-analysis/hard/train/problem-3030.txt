I’m on record being against settlements though I withhold that objection for East Jerusalem. We can discuss that specifically if you like but it’s somewhat irrelevant to this topic. Jews did not show up and start stealing Arab land. This is well documented, and it’s a cornerstone of the pro Palestinian argument even though it’s demonstrably false.
So you know nothing about the start of this conflict? Pity. I’ve already stated that that I’m against settlements excepting East Jerusalem, and at that only to a point. Beyond that I’ll stand next to you and criticize Israel and often have, but the claim that Jews showed up and stole land is false.
So you cannot legitimately state that Israel didn't steal land. They did, and still do to an extent.
Yeah, and there isn't exactly any clamor from most people about the land of Israeli proper. Israel was bound by no agreements at the time so what made up Isfael i 1948 is Israel. People do have a problem with the land occupied/annexed in 1967. Israel had signed and ratified the UN charter and Geneva convention, the former which forbids annexation of land through war and the latter which forbids civilian placement on occupied land. Both of which Israel is currently violating and from which stem most of the international condemnation of Israels actions.
