Also a lot of the blocking troops are said to be Kadyrovites - Chechens - who probably don't mind as much shooting Russian deserters as some kid from Moscow might.
Specifically: it seems like Ukraine has the ability to continue defending their territory against a Russian people who probably don't really want to be fighting this war for Putin. But that doesn't mean they have the ability to march on Moscow and take down Russia. Russians would probably be a lot more willing to defend their own country against a theoretical offensive Ukraine.
Looking at how the war is going, and the way the geography affects strategy, they will probably retake Crimea before they retake all of the seized eastern oblasts.
May I remind you of when Ukraine, a country without a Navy, sank Russia’s flagship, the москва? And that was before we gave them any decent weapons. And that Turkey is not allowing Russia’s Northern Fleet into the Black Sea to augment its Black Sea Fleet?
Russia is like a dead man walking, here, who hasn’t yet realized he’s dead. The war is already lost, it’s just a matter of time.
