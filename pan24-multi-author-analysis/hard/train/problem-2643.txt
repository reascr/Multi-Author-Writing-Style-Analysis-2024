Some board meeting in the recent past: "Either way, there's a cost to be paid, but this way, it's born by the poors and the biosphere, not us. Even if we get a slap- on- the- wrist fine, we still come out ahead compared to the cost of, you know, doing things safely. See? Brilliant".
That said, Trump fckd a lot of shit up to the nth degree, from the postal service to national security, had twice as much time to do his worst, and fixing shit takes longer than destroying it. Biden can't undo all Trump's sabotage in half the time.
Specifically, company leadership should be able to more easily be held personally liable, both civilly and criminally, for their profit- maximizing decisions that result in disasters like this.
If the consequences for creating an ecological disaster were prison, instead of a 3% loss in this quarter's profits, corporate executives would not damn the consequences.
Prison for executives who order their companies to commit crime needs to be the consequences for corporate crimes.
Too often, corporate executives and other leaders face no punishment for their selfish or stupid decisions that cause so many problems. When bankers ruined the economy and had to bailed out in 2009, no one was held responsible; no one went to jail, but lots of average citizens were severely damaged. I propose the "Direct Accountability and Responsibility Act - DARA". For every decision a corporation, organization, or other entity (governmental boards, inspectors, police departments) SOMEONE has to sign off and be held responsible, and if there is a later problem, accountable. Yes, I know about scapegoats, loopholes, plausible deniability, and that this proposal needs to be refined. Contact your local elected leaders and media personnel.
