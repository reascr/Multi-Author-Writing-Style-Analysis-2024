I fail to see how a treaty made in the 1730s would allow an indigenous tribe a specific exemption to continue owning firearms some of which come into existence over two centuries after.
A new generation of high performance rimfire cartridges would probably be good for the UK as well given their ban on all semi auto guns save for rimfire long guns and shotguns (barring NI’s exemptions).
It's banning any semi-automatic rifle or shotgun, capable of using a detachable magazine of 5+ rounds, plus a list of explicitly named firearms, available at:
In canada we have had magazine limit laws since the 90s, with a few loophole exceptions centerfire semi automatic rifles and shotguns are limited to 5 rounds and pistols are limited to 10.
So… rifles are rarely if ever used in crimes in Canada, and legally purchased guns are rarely used in crimes in Canada… but those two categories are the subject of this new round of regulation?
It sat at the lower end of Canadian firearms regulation as a non-restricted firearm and fires an intermediate round. Soft enough to not sore one’s shoulder but still powerful enough to take something down like deer reliably. Simple to use and the semi auto function allows for very rapid follow up shots if needed.
