Pro russia are their own kind of despicable persons but I equally hate the idiots who try to "both sides" the issue, even if sometimes they are just oblivious pacifists with good intentions.
What's funny is Russia is recruiting neo-Nazis from Europe (who ideologically agree with Russia) at the same time as they claim they're "denazifying" Ukraine.
I have a group of friends and they all think that Ukraine is kicking Russia's arse, the Russians are deserting and there are anti war riots in Russia. All form their opinions from exposure to local news sources and none from independent commentators.
I have the time to follow the situation and l try to form a balanced view. I think Zelenski is being manipulated by others and that Russia is being underestimated.
What l don't want to see is an escalation manipulated by others with ulterior motives. And if this happens l still don't underestimate the Russians nor who may choose to support them in a serious conflict.
The second Russia uses nukes it's no longer "Russia VS Ukraine, which is supported by the West" to "Russia VS the World".
"muh nukes" is really all Russia has by that point anymore... the thing is internationally speaking NO country would OK with Russia using nukes even if Ukraine would counter-invade because Russia started the goddamn war to begin with!
