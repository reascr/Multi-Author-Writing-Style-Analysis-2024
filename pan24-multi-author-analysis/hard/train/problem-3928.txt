So voting "present" is just a vote to continue the vote-whipping, deal-making, pizza-delivery process.
I think that voting "present" allows you to fulfill your obligation to participate in the vote, but doesn't add a vote to the Speaker candidate's tally. Because you were present, the number of votes necessary for a candidate to win the Speakership does not change.
They are trying to elect a speaker. None of them have sworn in. There are currently no US federal representatives, only senators (117th Congress ended yesterday). It's this weird artifact from colonial days where colonies held their elections, all representatives traveled to the capitol, elected a speaker, the speaker swore them in, then started Congress. The speaker is the one who selects committee members, chooses votes, and decides on the rules for the next two years. Literally the only two things the representative-elects can do is vote for speaker, and vote to adjourn for the day.
Over half of the members must select a speaker. The GOP has like 51% of the seats, and 2% refuse to vote for McCarthy, the obvious frontrunner and person the old GOP and most of the HFC (MAGA folks) voted for.
I’ve been hearing that the votes are because the far left wing has some super extreme concessions they’d like McCarthy to make, and that’s the reason they’re not voting him in. I heard there are 25 of them in total who will be changing their vote in subsequent votes to embarrass him - one each vote.
(Like, for a minute. One of the rule changes that McCarthy already allowed was for a simple majority to unseat a speaker, so any outcome from any vote, no matter what is more or less non binding - which seems oddly fitting, coming from republicans.).
Huh. That could be an out for some of the GOP rebels...except that McCarthy would need (checks numbers) like 12 of them to defect TO HIM to beat Jeffries even by one vote.
