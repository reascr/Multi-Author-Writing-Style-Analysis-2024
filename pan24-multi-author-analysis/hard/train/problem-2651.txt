They won’t have a chance to fact check with more sources because 1. they’ll believe that and 2. the majority of sources available to them back what they teach.
I 110% agree with you, but there is a difference between official textbooks with the facts transformed to fit what the “cultural system” expects from their general population and what truly happened.
Unfortunately yes, basically take the approach being done by Putin at schools, where they are teaching them history and values according to their ideology.
Education is highly, and unavoidably, bound up in the educator's values and ideology in many ways. There is no such thing as a non-political and objective education anywhere in the world.
Using your example, the fact that people think history, of any kind at all, is worth teaching is the result of a value judgement. It's a result of the influence most educators' cultures had on them.
Anything educators teach kids is a result of their upbringing, society, ideology, etc. (or that of bureaucrats above them).
