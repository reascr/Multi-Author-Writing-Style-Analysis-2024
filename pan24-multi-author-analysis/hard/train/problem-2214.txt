i've been asking this all over here. i haven't seen much support and absolutely zero support from people in real life.
when i heard the news i thought, "well i guess that's gonna be one of the right-wing talking points for the next two years, along with hunter biden's dick.".
What you say is correct. The part you're missing however is, just how potentially dangerous all these experts believe Bout still is, how he will be immediately utilized by Putin, what political hay Putin gained, what precedent was set for any future negotiations for Americans still held, and that this was a terrible "swap" even tho an American came home.
And in the end, Putin made it work, it is now pitting Americans against Americans, whether it's people that support the right (whom Trump released 5000 Taliban prisoners) or just people who don't see the equivalent value of said prisoners, which is a legitimate concern, to people who say it's only because she is famous and Whelan wasn't given that treatment.
She did a week prior to the invasion for the Russian Premier League. Hard to assume you'd be taken when not many others are currently in custody as political pawns. We'll see later in interviews if she actually possessed weed carts, but it easily could have been 100% fabricated. Again, if it wasn't, that's 100% on her and the Russian judicial system acted as harshly as they could, for the exact reason as stated above, to make her a political pawn.
Russia demanded a 1 for 1 prisoner exchange, despite the value of the prisoner America had. They knew the chaos that would presume after.
