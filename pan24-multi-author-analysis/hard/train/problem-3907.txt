There's no moral difference. The differences you brought up are geopolitical and if you're gonna take geopolitics into account then you can and should understand why it's a bad idea for Brazil to have their incoming president start shit talking Russia before they even take office.
Nobody likes what's happening, but his promise in the elections was to reestablish our foreign relations and telling Russia to go fuck themselves wouldn't help that much, especially now that Bolsonaro shut down our fertilizer factories (made by Lula and Dilma over 10 years ago) and we became heavily reliant of Russia once again.
Brazil was inserted into the new world order with the BRICs, but he has his place in the old one. Not saying it's righteous, but it's how the country aligns its Foreign Affairs - by not telling others how to do things but understanding and trying to counsel within its interests like any other country as well as the US and Europe which are the current holders of the status quo and have all the interest in Ukraine.
I guess it's too much of a hassle for the "world's fifth most populous country" to actually act in their best interest and strenhen relationships, stabilize the world and save on trade agreements later rather than make pennies and lose credibility with multiple countries. I mean fuck half the world's population. Am i right?
