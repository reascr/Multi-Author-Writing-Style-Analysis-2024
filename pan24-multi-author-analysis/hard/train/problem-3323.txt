It’s a well established Republican Fact (TM) that communists and nazis were best friends. The eastern front of WWII was the most friendly war in human history.
Hitler based lots of Germany’s race laws on southern segregation laws, but he also thought America was a bit too racist with the “one drop” rule, so their definition of Judaism was less extreme than the American “one drop” rule for what constitutes a non-white.
What part of Hitler's core belief that blue-eyed blond Christian men are superior to everyone else and you will be rounded up, jailed, exterminated for any deviance such as being non-christian, homosexual, of a differing race etc. can even remotely be attributed to Biden?
Sounds more like GOP white conservative Christians unless you support doublespeak (1984) deliberately obscuring, disguising, distorting, or reversing the meaning of words as Trump and DeSantis are prone to do.
Furthermore these Blue eyed Christian men want women to stay home, Tulsi, and bear children, not go out and speak their mind.
