I'm currently thinking Jeffries might actually end up as speaker. Given how idiotic the anti-McCarthy fascists are, I can legit see a vote where enough of them agree to vote 'present' simply to spite McCarthy but they miscalculate/miscommunicate in a way that Jeffries gets it.
I'm currently dreaming of a vote where the Freedumbers all vote 'present' to spite McCarthy and don't realize they are putting Jeffries in as Speaker by doing so.
according to AOC he was asking if the dems would vacate the house to lower the threshold and make McCarthy speaker, presumably without his vote.
In order for McCarthy to become Speaker, he needs every R to vote for him except 5, so the caucus of 20 is enough to completely halt the process by simply voting for someone else.
But more telling than the actual vote this morning is what didn't happen - McCarthy wanted to adjourn but didn't have the votes to do so, forcing him to proceed with votes everyone knew would fail.
But that isn't all. The Speaker sets the agenda for the entire house. He could, as an example, refuse to allow a house vote on any legislation with his name on it. His sponsorship would effectively be a death knell.
And this says nothing about the House Leadership Fund or McCarthy's status among the Republican Party leadership. At some point Gaetz is going to want money and McCarthy is going to laugh in his face or have his friends do it for him. These outlaws may be able to get reelected, but there is every chance they'll end up the GOP's poor relatives after this stunt.
