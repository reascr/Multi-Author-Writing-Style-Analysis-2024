I can sort of give a pass on not moving in on the Bundy ranch since the traitors had family members as human shields, but the soft glove treatmemt at the Wildlife refuge is inexcusable. It started us down this road of getting bigger & bigger padded gloves for white domestic terrorists. That it would only encouragement the terrorists feeling of not being accountable should have been obvious.
So the decision to bully coddle white supremacists started with Oklahoma City? I suppose that fits.
Uh, yeah. He's right. There would have been a lot of people shot in that crowd, by either the police or National Guard. But a bunch of white folks? Nah they're not terrorists; that's just "legitimate political discourse.".
Yeah. No fucking shit. Watching it unfold on live TV being met with the most impotent law enforcement response of all time was about as clear a display of white privilege as there has ever been in history. If the the 1/6 insurrectionists were black, they'd have been killed before they got to the doors.
If they would.have been black they would all be charged with murder for the people that were killed during the insurrection. I don't know why more people aren't talking about this. The sentences would be much harsher if they were sentencing black people.
