Regardless whatever they decided they better decide quickly or else DeSantis and Trump might take white house and I'm not looking forward for either of them ESPECIALLY DeSantis.
Out of 46 election in U.S history, only 10 president that was not reelected. If anything it better for democrats to put their hope on biden than undermine him.
Is this because trump is likely the nominee and Biden has a chance to beat trump again and not other democrat candidates? Did Biden say just couple weeks ago that he would not run again?
I think that's why he's being pushed to run again. Old and senile or not, he's probably still got a better chance of beating Trump again (assuming that's who the Republicans run) than anyone else the Democrats have. I'm not thrilled with it. I'd like to see someone younger and more progressive, but I don't know if politically that would be the best strategy for a win.
Really I wish we just had ranked choice voting. This voting for the lesser of two evils thing is getting old.
It's happened before. Reagan was likely senile for most of his second term and he won by a landslide. I mean, I'm not going to say that he was a good president but it wasn't really the senility that was the issue. It was more the fact that he was a puppet for advocates of the right wing economic policies that continue to fuel the growing income inequality we are still dealing with today.
