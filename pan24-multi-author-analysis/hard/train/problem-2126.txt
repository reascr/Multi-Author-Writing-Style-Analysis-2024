Kind of a mixed bag. Pope Francis supports civil marriage for gay couples, or at least he did in 2010. Being gay is not a sin, but homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered”.
So the Catholic Church currently accepts same-sex civil unions, but does not accept same sex marriages as the Sacrament of Marriage is between a man and a women, as per God’s design.
The Church already allows Anglican priests and bishops to be in same-sex civil unions, and clergy have blessed same-sex marriage already.
The Episcopal Church in the US not only allows gay marriage but has equal rights for clergy & church positions for all people regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.
