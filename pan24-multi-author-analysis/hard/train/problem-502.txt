If the House is within 2-3 seats, there might be a little wiggle room for bipartisanship. Some of the seats Dems lost were to fairly moderate Republicans, and this election as a rejection of MAGA might empower them a bit.
Only if moderate Republicans pull off a coup and build a coalition for the speakership with the Dems. Otherwise, the speakership will be decided by the Republican Party plurality of crazy. And without the speakership, Dems have no control over the house agenda regardless of how many Republicans would join them in moderate legislation.
Republicans, for whatever reason, ASSUME that if Democrats take control of the legislature, that they (the Democrats) will treat Republicans like Republicans treat Democrats when Republicans are in power.
Democrats don't eviscerate oversight committees in order to make hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars disappear.
Democrats don't file frivolous lawsuits to keep relief funds from reaching their intended recipients.
Democrats don't send out police to assault conservative protesters and drag them into the backs of unmarked vans.
Democrats don't reorganize the governments of blue states to ensure that Republicans never win again no matter how many votes they get.
One thing to know about Georgia is the republicans donâ€™t advertise to vote - they KNOW when & where to vote.
So knowing they actively suppress putting out remember to vote signs around, tells you everything you need to know.
