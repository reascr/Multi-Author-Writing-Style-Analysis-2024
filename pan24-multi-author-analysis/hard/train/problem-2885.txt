That being said the federal government seems like they've really left the door open to this kind of thing by only funding such a small portion of states education budgets. 10% is really not that much.
This seems bad and honestly I suspect that there are some serious ulterior motives at play. This would let the state underfund say big cities schools and would probably let them get around certain antidiscrimination directives say over racial minorities or trans kids or what have you.
They're probably trying to a) deny minorities the public school money needed for them to get a proper education in a public school (this would disproportionately affect Tennessee's minorities), and b) force people to switch to private schools, probably with the intent to get people to stick with private schools if they're forced to send their kids there for long enough.
And considering that the state government is dominated by Republicans, they'll use that power to defund more public schools, thus worsening education opportunities for minorities in particular, and everyone overall. Besides, are you really gonna take what they say at face value?
