Itâ€™s potentially more than watching themselves, it could include methods and paths that were employed to move the second and third in line of succession to secure locations, where those secure locations are located, where blind spots in coverage might be, capabilities of cameras such as resolution, zoom, pan/tilt, among other national and congressional security practices and procedures.
Publishing government facility security footage is not only a national security risk but also an example of the legislative branch meddling in the Affairs of the judicial branch.
Given that the footage is likely to be used in the court of law, I guess I'm curious as to what sort of benefit you think could be gained by releasing this footage publicly, especially since such a release could be used by defendants to argue that the publicization of this information makes it impossible for them to receive a fair trial?
I truly hope that this appearance of impropriety and partisanship ends up leading to investigations and charges against those involved but I am not hopeful given how enamored the right wing seems to be with treating our political and governmental systems like a business crafted with the intent of benefiting shareholders and the bottom line rather than a constitutional system of checks and balances.
Very welcome. I would have said the same thing if non-public footage was being delivered by the legislature to any media outlets over the last few years.
