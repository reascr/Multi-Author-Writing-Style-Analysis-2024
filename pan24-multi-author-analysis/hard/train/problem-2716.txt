One of Ukraine's strategies this whole conflict has been to make Russia pay for every bit of ground taken. Attacking traditionally spends many more resources than defending. Last I saw, Bakhmut was pretty much leveled, so I doubt Ukraine is holding it just to hold it. This is what the north looked like right before Ukraine's main counter-offensive took back a huge chunk of land.
I called it a strategy because it doesn't happen this way in all conflicts by a long shot. It was a simple statement, but there is more behind it. It isn't just that they are making them pay, they are slowly conceding ground while Russia pushes forward into their defensive lines.
For Ukraine, ultimately if Russia is trying to push through this point, they can either go for a tactical retreat, or hold their ground. I assume they have concluded they can gain more by holding their ground (possibly inflict more damage on an attacking army while being well entrenched?).
The fact that both sides are locking horns about an empty town in the middle of nowhere is puzzling to me too, but the above is the only logical explanation I found.
One of the opinions (among many) out there is that, on the Russian side, this is just Wagner trying to prove to Putin they are the elite crack team, and can push Ukrainians back here and there if needed. I.e. Wagner is trying to win a battle through brute force, just for internal Russian politic purposes. From there they might secure more funding, influence or who knows what. It is understood that Wagner has both very top quality mercenaries, together with low quality conscripts and even prisoners released out of jail. They have enough bodies to throw at it for now.
