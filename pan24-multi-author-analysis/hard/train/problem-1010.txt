Thanks for summarizing this so well. The question is what should be done about it? This works, it excites their rabid base, it distracts the opposition who points at the clown in a strange entrancing spectacula,, all the while billionaires and corporations destroy the country.

You have to persuade people who don't always automatically agree with you 100% of the time to win elections.
I don't think I agree with that based on the fact that the independent vote swings wildly from one election to another. Here's an article on the subject with some research:
