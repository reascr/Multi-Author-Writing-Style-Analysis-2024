If he had achieved actual military successes, his political position would have likely skyrocketed. But Wagner’s Bakhmut campaign does’t seem to be much more advanced than it was 4 months ago and losses are mounting.
Now he’s left with massive costs, a lot of dead mercenaries, no real successes to show and he has just recently publicly criticized Russian army.
Now instead of running a shock troop of assholes he now has nothing tangible left that is of any worth to Putin, and he will likely watch Wagner get butchered as the army tries to capitalize on the failures.
However, since his use of massing troops did work and it did embarrass the military in some ways, they are likely not his best friends now. And with less and less bodies to be able to recruit and throw the issue, he is going to be stuck with less and less results.
I imagine the logic was for Prigozhin to show that he could make gains where the army could not, and he kind of achieved something in some way by maybe getting a few more meters than the army, at the cost of basically the reserves of troops he could get his hands on. As the prisoners realize a lifetime in jail is still better than a headless corpse in a week, that supply of cannon fodder is dwindling fast.
A lot of the current news has major offensives and "gains" being attributed to Wagner. Whether is this just propaganda to an extent, or actual real information, it means that Wagner is actually being used as the cannon fodder to try and get somewhere.
