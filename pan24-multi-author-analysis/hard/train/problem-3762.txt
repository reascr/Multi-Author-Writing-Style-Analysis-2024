Right but we trade on a global market and that’s why what Russia is doing is screwing us , because European countries decide to trust a country that should have never been trusted , not we all have to pay the price because they liked their cheap energy and makes them look good because they have no greenhouse gasses that their producing but their outsourcing , so now European countries can say “look we lower our co2 output” , just how the world uses China as a factory. Lol sorry went on a rant hahaha. At least we learning.
Saudis doesn’t respect Americans and I can’t wait until oil shit is over with so we can go tell Saudi Arabia to fuck around and find out. We should have went to war with them and blew them up after 9/11.
