Yeah, that's also Russia holding the 3rd largest defense budget for over a decade as well as the massive stockpiles of Soviet arms. Granted, we have no idea how much went to corruption, but a single 120 billion injection doesn't quite even the field as much as it would seem just looking at 2022 numbers alone.
1). they are completely different than any jets the Ukrainians have used. So training would be a long-term process as well as F-16s requiring a substantial amount more specialized and frequent maintenance than current Ukrainian jets.
In other words, if we give them F-16s, we need to be ready to do a whole lot more than that as well. If we stick to weapons that can't easily be used outside of Ukraine, then it's unlikely Russia will escalate on their own.
The nuclear threats happen on regular basis so I doubt that's the thing - they won't toss another "world should let us have Ukraine otherwise we'll nuke nearby countries". It gotta be something else - they might decide they have reached the goal on Ukraine (while not getting it at all), and now they'll conduct another "special military operation" in Moldova which has issues with Transnistria.
They're giving themselves 22 days to turn this shitshow around and if not, they'll announce theyre moving on from Ukraine and invading Belarus, who should be an easier target.
