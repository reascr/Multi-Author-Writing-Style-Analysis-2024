"A republic is a state in which power rests with the people or their representatives; specifically a state without a monarchy.".
Yes, and? They don't care about laws, or even the Constitution, despite what they'd have you believe. Sure, they'll use them, when it's to their advantage, but as soon as it becomes inconvenient, they'll dispense with any pretext of caring. They care about power, and that's it. "Law and order" is a slogan to allow them to use or abuse the law as they see fit, to impose the type of order they want. It's practically doublespeak.
Look at long lines to vote. When it happens in, say, Atlanta, they'll say there's no problem, and it shouldn't be easy to vote, because only motivated people should be able to vote. Then look at Arizona, and suddenly it's such an egregious violation that either the election should be voided and redone, or the loser should just be declared the winner.
The election in Arizona was probably the most historically scrutinized election in any state in the history of this country. If there were even the possibility of fraud by democrats, the GOP operatives absolutely would have witnessed it.
Everyone knew she would shout “rigged” with no evidence if she lost even before the election. Sure enough that’s what she did.
