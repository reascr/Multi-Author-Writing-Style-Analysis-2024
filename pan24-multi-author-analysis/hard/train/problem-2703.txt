any how back to trump: he is directly responsible-through both action (advocating quack science,) and inaction (ignoring proper science, and not taking approx measures,)- for over a million deaths. each death was some one's son or daughter, maybe father or mother. husband or wife or lover.
honestly... christian doctrine makes it clear that murder is the only in the ten commandments that can be committed with inaction- that's what made the parable of the good samaritan so offensive to certain legalistic parties- in the story, the priest and the rich merchant person ("upstanding members of the community") were murders for not helping the victim where the scummy samaritan wasn't. (to put it into a more modern perspective, the samaritan would be a trans woman, as far as the stereotypes the audience holds.).
Yep. We know that in February 2020 trump knew that COVID was deadly and airborne. How do we know that trump knew that? Because trump secretly called Bob Woodward and told Woodward that, and Woodward recorded it and released the recording to the public half a year later.
He lied to the American public and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the suffering of millions. Zero penalties for that mass murder. Because the magic (R).
