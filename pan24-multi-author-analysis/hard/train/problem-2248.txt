Not confirmed, but almost certainly the case. The Ukrainians are also doing good things with their drones, and calling in arty strikes with incredible precision. The footage is insane. The Russians are also not doing themselves any favors by being complete slobs in their encampments. They just throw their neon green MRE bags everywhere and stick out like a sore thumb. They look like hobo camps. That’s a big no no, and sign of poor leadership from top down.
Not just that. They are getting the stripped down export versions of Russian shit. So not even as good as the actual Russian shit. And they plan on fighting China with this stuff?
You keep bringing up non-sequiturs like China, which is not part of the argument. China does bad shit, up to and including genocide. That has very little to do with India buying Russian energy.
India didn’t just keep the status quo; it took advantage of low Russian oil prices and increased imports thereby funding Russia’s war in Ukraine.
It's a backhanded comment to point out how India isn't doing shit and funding Russia's side of the war through increased oil purchases...
Like I said, Modi started refusing it because he cares more about telling his voters that India is "an emerging superpower" than children starving.
What's really fucked up is Modi started rejecting it out of principle despite almost half the children in India not having food security.
