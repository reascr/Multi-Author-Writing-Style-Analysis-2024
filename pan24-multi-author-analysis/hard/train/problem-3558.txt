I gotta say dude, for someone who claims to be indifferent about abortion, you sure seem to be insistent about pushing anti abortion talking points.
Think about this logic: if our "leaders" are "pro-life" and if they know what they are doing, it would make sense to have prenatal care in place before eliminating abortion. It's either kakistocracy or a predatory scam by the republican party to get votes. The mortality rates are going up, already.
She should take note that a professional, educated system would have phased abortion out in an orderly and systemic way to lower the risk of collateral damage. That was not the case. Things are dangerous now.
Yes, but I'm afraid rights to credit and fair housing are going to be the next to go. With the religious extremism, blatant ignorance, and the disinformation campaigns - I'm concerned American women risk the same treatment as the women of Iran after the overthrow of the Shah in the Iranian Revolution of 2/11/1979.
When women start dying by the thousands because doctors refuse to touch them for fear of legal repercussions, then the Texas GOP will hang a banner of “Mission Accomplished” over the state capitol, because ideology has trumped all common sense and compassion.
