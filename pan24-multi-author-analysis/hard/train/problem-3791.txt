Israel deploys ABM systems. Yes Iron Dome is not one of them but they have a fully integrated defense architecture with midcourse and terminal intercept capability for IRBM and probably ICBM warheads.
Arrow 3 is their primary midcourse/extreme altitude weapon while Arrow 2 and David’s Sling are meant for terminal phase warheads.
Arrow 3 looks freakin awesome and AFAIK is one of the only ABM systems to be tested against multiple (3) inbound targets. It boils down to Israel having comprehensive protection they can feel very confident in against Iran and just about everyone else. It is greatly enhanced by the relatively small area to defend. Even Arrow 3.
Also, it's just like the US system at scale. Can promise limited protection. Full protection from the world's best ballistic missles? I hope we never find out. Sure Israel has no problem with Russia or the US, but the threat is implied and there is a next gen of missle being born.
It's not a knock on Israel, it just speaks to the difficulty of intercepting ballistic missles period. Israel relies on extremely credible threats of gratuitous violence to anyone who decides to use such a missle to deter such attacks.
If Israel didn't fear Iran's missile stockpile, or Iran's capacity to retaliate, they would have destroyed every nuclear facility in Iran a dozen times over.
Exactly, Israel don’t mess around, they took the new at the time F16 modded it and took out Iraq nuclear power plant in the 80s and they were first to use F35 in combat over Syria. They also are penetrating Iran airspace with the F35 so could see repeat of Iraq but with F35s.
