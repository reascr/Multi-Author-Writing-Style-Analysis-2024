Because that's too much effort. The zoomers that do shit like this have a vision, but they realize the only way they can enact it is to do the lowest effort shit like vandalism towards completely unrelated people. Bonus points when they make a goddamn fool of themselves like the kids who glued theirselves to the floor of a museum only for the museum to lock them in overnight. All because it's too much effort to actually take action that would piss off the right people.
They’ve got me talking about how useless, and counter productive their efforts are. 900 vehicles by 4 tires, that potentially 3600 tires will head into landfill, well before their life is up. So now we need to truck 3600 tires to get them replaced. Tow 900 cars to a garage to get the tires changed. Its almost $720,000 of property damage (at $200 a tire, which is close to a budget price tire) so thats the “minimum” please tell me that the greenhouse gas emissions from trucking, manufacturing, and taking the tires to their final resting place is less than the emissions by just leaving those tires inflated. Also - tire ranges from 15-25 pounds each, so 3600 tires at call it 20 pounds is 76,000 POUNDS of garbage. Super good for the environment right?
But yea. We’re still talking about the climate issue right? I mean we’re certainly talking about the increase in climate damage these tire extinguishers are committing. So yea. We’e talking about the climate issue still.
It's more like they have been politely asking for 50 years for climate change to be taken seriously. They are no longer asking.
Because they have gone after the rich and powerful repeatedly and most people treat them the same as they are now.
Your outrage would be the same regardless of target. At least this way it gets people like you and me talking.
