Fascism comes first in this sense. To be in power, a fascist will take over businesses with their government or remove the rights of groups within a business. Nationalizing an industry, as an example, is a fascist move, but it looks like communistic behavior out of context. Taking away a private business' right to be a business is a fascist behavior, especially if you are only doing it because it disagrees with your worldview.
Facism is the dictatorial rule of a central figure, using the forcible suppression of opposition and individual interests for the perceived good of the ruling group.
No, this would be fascism as the conservative government is utilizing the power of the state to punish a company for not following the dictates of the conservative party. That is fascism not communism.
I ALSO said that there were cases of fascism masquerading as communism. Which is what you are describing. They lied about their beliefs and goals to gain the support of the people. Else wise, they'd have actually done the things they claimed to support rather than amassing power and subjugating the proletariat.
One of the biggest lies ever told is that Russia or China were ever Communist countries, it was always fascism masquerading as communism, or just outright fascism called communism by the west.
