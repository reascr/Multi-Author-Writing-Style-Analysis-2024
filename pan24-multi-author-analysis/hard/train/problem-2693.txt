And don't get started on the land and water usage of beef. Just from the soja, that gets added to animal feed, 1 pound of beef takes more than 1 pound of soja to preduce, and that without all the other parts of the feed, the drinking water, land usage, etc.
Interesting, that you mention dairy farmers. Dairy is also one of the most water intensive. Depending on where you look, dairy milk gets often put at more water intensive compared to almond milk.
I wish oat milk had the caloric numbers that almond does, because it’s the closest to actual milk so far. But it’s also like 6x as much as almond milk so I just can’t justify it. And as someone else pointed out here - dairy farms take up something like 5x as much water as almond farms.
That graphic that went around showed soy and oat as the least intensive but even almond was well well behind cow milk in that regard….
