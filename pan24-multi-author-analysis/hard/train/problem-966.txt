Living in upstate NY. It's the middle of February and it's raining. We've had some really cold days, but any snow we have gotten has melted withing a couple of days thanks to 40 degree temps... In freaking January and February. I've used our snow blower once all season.
When I was a kid we had snow every year at the beginning of December. It's February and there is no snow.
It's the middle of February. This summer and all summers to come are going to be unbearable. We are past the point of "when" and into the "now". Global warming and the effects its going to have on the planet are being seen every year with increasing intensity and its only going to get worse.
There's been very light snow in NYC this year. And only a couple times at that. We used to get feets of snow to where I'd wake up in the morning to watch the news to see if schools were closed.
And as pessimistic as it sounds to say, it's already too late to change. We can only hope to mitigate the impact but I somehow doubt we'll come to our senses as a collective and make that happen.
