A pretty significant number of military analysts don't think China could win that war even if the US did nothing at all. Taiwan is a tough nut to crack. And amphibious invasions are a crapshoot.
True, an amphibious invasion would kill so many Chinese. It would be like D-Day, but not a suprise and against an enemy with modern weapons systems that can target Chinese ships during their slow journey across the Taiwanese Strait. Oh, and there are only a few beaches suited for an amphibious invasion, so wherever they land will be heavily defended.
Hopefully, the sanctions put on Russia will scare the CCP from invading Taiwan, especially since China is much more vulnerable to sanctions than Russia is.
By the way, all these Chinese activities while Russia is also starting a new offensive in Ukraine, clearly shows that China doesn't want the war to end and we should give up the illusion that China could help to make a deal with Russia for peace.
China loves the war, not only does it distract and weaken its rivals, they also can buy an absurd amount of discounted resources from Russia, while they became their one and only trading partner that sends millions worth of goods every day to keep Russia and the war running.
