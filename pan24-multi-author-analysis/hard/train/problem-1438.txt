Universal conscription is the one issue where the most liberal people, particularly women, will maintain a very conservative view. People want equal rights but they don't want equal responsibilities.
Conscription is necessary when the nation is threatened though. In Ukraine many brave women joined their male counterparts in the armed forces to push back the invaders, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that women have their place on the battlefield. I think it's true that women tend to dislike armed conflict more than men but when the necessity arises, all should answer the call of their nation.
However you’re correct that women in general tend to oppose equality in conscription more than men. Which is stupid. However I think women oppose conscription in general more than men too.
It could still be 50% of the age group just based on things other than gender only. 100% would be too much anyways, we’d be spending half our defence budget on handling that increase in people doing military service. But the current system is discriminatory and unfair to men.
The Greens and Left Alliance (so the “liberal feminist lefties”) are the only parties that at least have equality in conscription in the party agenda. Not that they’re actively doing anything about it, but it’s a start I guess. (Unless some parties have added it this year, I don’t remember that happening.).
2. You dont forget 6 months to a year of training completely in one or two years. If this was true, society could not function since people would be really bad at retaining information.
Also, Russia uses conscription as well. How could Finland we defend against a large Russian conscript army without using conscripts of their own?
If you're referring to military conscription as slavery, bear in mind that Finland relies on (military and civilian) conscription of men for the nation's defence against Russia. Women may volunteer.
