If a malfunction, accident, hundreds of miles off course.. How does it still hit a building in the middle of nowhere?
NATO & Poland must determine if there was any military asset in that towns grain-building. Radar, Communications, intelligence forward bases, etc.. If there is anything of military value at that location, then it was an intentional strike on NATO.
I know people will say this will lead to end of the world if NATO retaliates. But the must, if Rusdia realizes they can land bombs in a NATO country without a response, Putin will know he can get away with even more and escalate on his end.
The side effect may be that towns like Zabolottya in Ukraine may gain anti-missile coverage, just because of their proximity to Poland, but I guess Russia wants to play that game.
Also I suspect prior to now they were refraining from firing anti-missile systems into Ukraine, even if they were projected to land very near the border. I wouldn't be surprised if the stance will change to "take the shot even if it's projected to hit near the Ukrainian side of the border, just in case".
