Better yet, make a new deal with Iran too, have them submit to international inspections if nuclear facilities to not develop a bomb and they can again sell their oil to the global market.
China isn't rising though, it's peaked. The one child policy is about to bite them in the ass hard as their birth rate has dwindled and millions are retiring every year and the outnumbered younger generations will be busy taking care of their elderly instead of trying to spread china's influence further abroad.
You seem to forget, all America would need to do is offer Venezuela a deal and bam, they've got plenty of cheap oil again and none of the theocratic fuckery of the Saudis.
Now if we to talk seriously, I wonder what additional currency the Saudis will be willing to accept besides usd. There are not a lot reliable and stable currencies out there in the world, the Euros can be an acceptable currency I guess.
A lot of dumb comments here about a possible future American invasion. razzian trolls probably. USA never invaded another country because of oil, and never seized foreign oil by force, unlike the razzian nazis.
At any point during the occupation of Iraq the US never took oil. IIRC, the French actually had the most oil contracts with Iraq.
