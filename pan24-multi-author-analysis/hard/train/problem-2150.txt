The problem is this should be a federal level tax, not a state level. Driving every rich person out of California and to Texas would not help Californians overall. This type of tax needs to come from the federal level so that all states are on a level playing field.
I mean to some extent, yeah if your definition of "fair share" is far enough out of line with what other states would tax them. CA is already pushing the limits there it seems.
Yes, they can try to find ways to keep revenue coming in even as the state loses population. How does that example apply to a wealth tax? You think the state is going to be able to accurately track wealth acquired while residing in CA and successfully tax non-residents for it?
Given the two options above, which is going to bring in more tax revenue from wealthy yacht owners and which is more prone to evasion by people claiming a residence out of state?
Wealth tax on yacht: It wouldn't be based on the yacht, but your entire wealth, and only that which can be seen in the state... assuming you're a resident of the state. If you're not a resident of the state, then a wealth tax that includes your yacht wouldn't apply at all. Use one of your houses elsewhere for your place of residence and you're good to go with avoiding California's wealth tax even though your yachts are all over the place in the state. It would be cheaper to buy/rent a residence out of state specifically to avoid the wealth tax.
