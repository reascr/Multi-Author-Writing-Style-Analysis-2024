230 bills of anti trans legislation have been introduced this year alone. That fact by itself shows that it should've been talked about for several minutes but no trans people are some political prop that don't deserve help.
Considering that attacking trans people seems to be the number one issue hands down in so many red states, that's a small amount of time no matter what the excuse is. I think they're afraid of losing transphobic diet dems.
I want people to give a damn things are getting bad for the trans community. So really at least some semblance that Democrats will try to do something about the enormous amount of anti trans legislation would honestly be enough. But what we get is effectively a nothing burger.
No doubt he is but at the same time paying lip service isn't good enough. We need swift action considering the fact there's a constant media campaign on right wing platforms demonizing us. Which is used as justification for electing more fascists. I'm not going to discount what has been done I'm just saying that we need more help and fast.
