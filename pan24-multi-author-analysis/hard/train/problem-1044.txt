She became an incomplete quadriplegic. She can’t stand too long. She can’t sit too long. She has a host of related issues. She can’t work.
you can't. my mom dealt with SS disability for 5 years before hers was approved, and they came up with 3 jobs she could do, 3 times over, just like this guy, and she had to appeal it 4 times thru her lawyer because those jobs didn't physically exist anymore. She finally asked for a different judge, and the judge finally granted it after the same bullshit. It cost her 5 years, and 12000 in lawyers fees to get her disability benefits. when the lawyer started filing paperwork to get challenge the constitutionality of the list of jobs, she was approved. this took 5 years. 5 years too long. the system was broken by republicans in the 1970's, and was done that way on purpose to make it impossible to get benefits you pay for and earned.
can't have the poor putting in too much money, need to encourage them to have a "private" retirement plan. the maximum was implemented in the 1980's when 401ks and other IRAs were becoming a thing, to encourage people to use the private sector, so the private sector could profit. its a scam.
its supposed to be, its supposed to make you quit trying. the suffering is the goal. its criminal, and likely unconstitutional, but you need a lawyer to work the system. its bullshit. it should not happen.
