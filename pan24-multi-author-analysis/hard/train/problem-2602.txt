Iowa wants to allow kids to work in meatpacking plants and construction jobs, with expanded hours, AND is going to eliminate liability for companies so that if a minor dies on the job, the employer canâ€™t be held liable.
Most Wisconsin employers hiring or permitting minors between the ages of 12 and 15 to work must possess a valid work permit for each minor before work may be performed. The work permit establishes a minor's proof of age and ensures that the employer, parent/guardian, and minor are aware of the employment of minors laws and regulations.
Work under direct supervision of minor's parent or guardian in connection with parent's or guardian's business, trade, or profession if minor would otherwise be permitted to work in the same job at age 14.
Minors must be at least 14 years of age to be employed or permitted to work in most gainful occupations. Younger minors may be employed or permitted to work as follows:
Michigan allows employment as young as 14, this kid had to have been right at 14. My only hope is he wasn't taken advantage of and getting a reasonable wage, but more than likely getting some wage cut due to being a minor.
