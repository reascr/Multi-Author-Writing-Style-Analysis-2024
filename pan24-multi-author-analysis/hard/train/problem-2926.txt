If he declares, he can no longer spend all the money he's raising on himself, it now becomes campaign money. Which leads me to think he'll declare without really declaring.
Oh course he's going to announce it. Last ditch effort to not have to testify and an attempt to stave off indictment. Hopefully no one falls for this bullshit and they nail him to the wall.
My point is, it looks like we do in fact have time to do this right, to line up the nails that will pin him to the goddamn wall.
The republican party is realizing that he is as cancerous to their cause as we realize he is to the nation. After the runoff, we have 2 years to the next election (1.5ish until primaries). Before, I wondered why he wasn't charged before these midterms. Now, I think it worked out well. So, while the gears turn towards his indictments, let him damage those who enabled him, until they are begging for the justified indictments to come.
In no way do I think he should not face criminal consequences, in fact I said "yet" from the very start.
While I am frustrated that he has not faced criminal consequences yet, am I the only one who feels less of a sense of urgency now that the midterms made so clear that he is a political loser, a has-been, a dead-weight that will encumber the Republican party for the foreseeable future?
