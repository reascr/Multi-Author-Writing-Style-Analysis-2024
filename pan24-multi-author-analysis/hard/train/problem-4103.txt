I know that this war is ghastly but keep in mind we are seeing the worst side of the Russian people right now. They are literally sending convicts to fight. They have been fed propaganda for years and anyone who speaks out has an â€˜accidentâ€™. This war has devastated their economy and will likely affect the children in the future who currently have no control over whatâ€™s going on. There are some horrible Russians and their are some noble Russians, but mostly there are just Russians who are normal people like us. They are victims of this war as well, even if they donâ€™t believe it. I say this not to be preachy, but because I know that it can be hard to see the good in the world sometimes, but at the end of the day there still are good people. Never give up hope my friend. ðŸ™‚.
Well here it is folks. When a dictator and a bunch of kleptos used to sucking each others' dicks get together and decide on continuity plans, here's what they come up with. Another reason democracy will always beat autocracy. They just can't think contingencies - they'll always do the stupidest shit. I bet nobody in the room even floated the idea of ending the war.
