Israel doesn't want to alienate Russia because Russia allows them to bomb Iranian weapons caches in Syria that are destined for Hamas. Russia also helps ensure that Iranian troops in Syria stay away from the Israeli border.
From Israel's perspective, preventing a a terrorist group that is actively attacking them from acquiring more weapons and preventing their main enemy from staging an invasion force on their border under the cover of fighting Syrian rebel groups are immediate national security concerns. Israel is worried about the development of the Iranian arms industry, especially Iran's nuclear program. However, their current strategy, is to engage in targeted bombing of infrastructure and the assassination of scientists and engineers critical to the Iranian arms industry and weapons development programs. I will grant you that this strategy is proving to be an obstacle, but not an existential threat, to the growth of Iranian arms industry.
And such geopolitical minutiae is worth thrusting the Iranian Defense Industry into such prominence and wealth unopposed?
Every sensible reason would point towards Israel embracing using their formidable Military Industrial Complex for such valiant a cause as this geopolitical David vs. Goliath.
Israel is a military powerhouse, and yet is refusing to raise their hand to defend a Nation they have deep ties to.
America wouldn't just be giving money to Israel for the fun of it and it would be much more cost. For example it would damage their information gathering capabilities in the middle east.
