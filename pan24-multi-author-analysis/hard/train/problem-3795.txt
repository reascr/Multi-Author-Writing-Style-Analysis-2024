You are correct in principle. However, there are many unanswered questions about his taxes because they haven't not been audited in detail. Obama and Biden have been audited (and released their returns) but for some reason the IRS didn't have the staff to even start on DJT until 2019 (coincidentally the same day the House committee asked about it) and even then didn't assign enough staff to check any of the 500 entities (mostly companies) that flow into his personal income taxes. So that right there is cause for concern: either the IRS was improperly giving one president a pass, or else they are chronically understaffed and can't really check to see if complicated tax returns are honest (maybe both could be true).
It's possible everything is 100% honest and above board. But it's also quite possible that the tax returns follow the letter of the law in how the paperwork is put together and how deductions are claimed, but those numbers don't accurately reflect reality. Given the high profile of this particular taxpayer, his claims of complete honesty and perfection, balanced by his public track record of arguing, litigating, and delaying to avoid actually being held to account on his claim of honesty and perfection, one would think the IRS would at least check that there is even any paperwork at all to support the claimed losses, deductions and donations, but right now it's not even clear they've gotten that far for any tax year within the current release. Which suggests again, either a politically-manipulated, or chronically weakened tax office (or both).
It's the lifelong pattern that I would guess prompted concern when Trump wouldn't voluntarily release his taxes like every other recent candidate. He's been implicated in all kinds of financial mis-dealings over the years, why would you assume his taxes would be different?
He's had too much time to figure something out to mitigate the bullshit and lets face it - he's done way worse than scam on his taxes and ain't shit been done about that.
We can all look at the top line numbers and say he's a tax cheat, because we know those numbers are unacceptable and wrong for society. But I what I want to hear is whether our corrupt tax code really does permit the wealthy to do this, or whether there's been impropriety.
What sane non-billionaire would decide that billionaires should pay less taxes than someone making 50k a year?
Do you not think the super rich are the ones who paid to have those rules in place? There's less than 1000 billionaires and every one of them is complicit.
