"The government" in British and Commonwealth contexts usually means the current political administration (the prime minister and other ministers in Parliament), so this implies that it's at the direction of politicians not the civil service or other apolitical administrators.
I'm an American, but I follow British politics for fun so I've picked up a lot of the lingo, but I think the first time I figured this out was a headline something like "Belgium hasn't had a government for two years" that totally didn't compute with the US understanding of "government.".
Good. What has he done for Australia to be given the honor of being featured in Australian money? (Or any currency for that matter). Feature something Australian in it instead.
Not actually Australian, actually, but I've heard about that. The Monarch didn't do anything, really. A constitutional monarchy means Governor Generals are "appointed" by the Monarch, although they're actually proposed representatives by the country's own government. The Monarch only approves of who the countries themselves recommend be the GG.
Because like Canada, Australia is a constitutional monarchy. We didn't fight a multi-year bloody war of independence like America did.
We just asked for independence nicely, and one of the stipulations for gaining freedom is the instituting of a constitutional monarchy. Which means while we run our nations completely independently, the British Monarch is still the head of state, even if they have no actual power inside the countries.
Well, it's not exactly independence if a representative of a foreign head of state can dissolve your government, or even have a say in dissolving your government, regardless of their relation to the monarch. I wouldn't call that independent, anyway.
