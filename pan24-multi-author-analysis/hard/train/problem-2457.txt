Walk around the outside pillars of St. Peter’s Square late at night. Between each pillar you’ll see a tents or boxes occupied by the homeless. Even on rainy days, on the doorstep of the largest Cathedral on earth and with the money stashed in those walls. How dare we not let those people inside for a warm, dry place to sleep. I’ve visited the Vatican numerous times, and each time I’ve left furious at the hypocrisy of the Catholic church.
How the Catholic Church is still allowed to remain is one of the great travesties of our time and history. Can you imagine if some other entity (profit or non-profit) be it Starbucks or your local Rotary Club having been found guilty of systematically sexually abusing thousands upon thousands of children for hundreds of years AND then participating in the largest cover up of said crimes by its entire leadership over those hundreds of years?? Would it have been dismantled? Assets sold off to fund victim treatments and relief.. Leaders tried, convicted and jailed??
Well you have to do this... Unless you have "offices" in another state in which case you can do this, or this. Unless you also have "offices" in another country in which case you have to do this but you can also do these other things too if you want.
You would have to be insane to try and structure an organization the size of the catholic church as a true monolithic entity. Ignoring the liability aspects, there are thousands of different sets of laws they have to comply with. Some of which get even messier when an organization crosses jurisdictions.
Think of it like if a McDonald's franchise gets sued. It may affect the reputation of the corporation but it isn't the corporation's cost to pay.
