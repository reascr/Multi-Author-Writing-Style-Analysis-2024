100% agree - I’m just pointing out that limiting competition on price shows the prospective quality improvements of single payor systems in the US.
Just to be clear on the Maryland model, there’s still competition on the insurance side but the state set caps on pricing meaning there’s no cost side competition leading only to quality side differentiation which improved outcomes in the state. A single payor system would have the same effect.
Nationalized payors lead to competition on quality without the issues of fully nationalized healthcare.
Edit - btw I’m advocating for nationalized payors (insurance) but not providers (hospitals and others who deliver care).
What we have right now is objectively the most expensive and least effective health care system in any western democracy.
A universal healthcare bill would have a significant economic consequence on the economy. Just as nationalizing the railroad would be or any other nationalization effort.
We have already nationalized the railroads with Amtrak, it is time to nationalize freight and all tracks so Amtrak can actually be a effective means of travel.
