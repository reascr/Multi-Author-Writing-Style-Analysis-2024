The growing list of people that have testified in Fulton have made this one of the highest profile state criminal investigations in American history. It includes:
The DA is supposedly weighing election fraud, conspiracy, oath of office violations, racketeering and other offenses, and indicated a decision on charges could come as early as the end of the year.
Sort of. The fifth can still be invoked to protect you from incrimination in a grand jury, but it's not a "get out of testimony card" that many believe it is.
In a trial the jury is instructed to draw no conclusions from someone pleading the fifth, it canâ€™t be used as a reason to convict someone. In a grand jury they are told that if someone pleading the fifth creates a greater probability a crime was committed they can indict based on that fact.
Depending on the case being civil or criminal, pleading the fifth can be seen/viewed as abject inference and an implication of guilt which is up to the jury.
Now in a criminal trial if a witness pleads the 5th would it not be reasonable to conclude that this witness may be involved in a criminal activity and could this not be taken as an indication that a conspiracy to commit the crime happened? After all the jury needs not to be convinced a crime happened but there is enough evidence to warrant a trial.
Jurors are instructed and made aware by the judge that they at not make an inference in criminal trials. No one is a mind reader though.
