Well now more since they found some in his home, this will complicate the investigation some because now they’ll have to investigate if there’s any other locations where classified information is being held.
I wouldn’t be surprised if Obama did do it, And Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, Carter, and possibly all their V.P.s apparently classified documents seem to go missing more frequently than one would think…..An investigation should focus on improving our record keeping.
There’s now been documents found in two locations, an office and Biden’s personal home….the logical next question would be are there anymore anywhere else?
— Nov. 2, 2022: Biden’s personal attorneys come across Obama-Biden administration documents in a locked closet while packing files as they prepare to close out Biden’s office in the Penn Biden Center. They notify the National Archives.
— Jan. 9, 2023: CBS News, followed by other news organizations, reveals the discovery of the documents at the Penn Biden Center. The White House acknowledges that “a small number” of Obama-Biden administration records, including some with classified markings, were found at the center. It makes no mention of the documents found in Wilminon.
