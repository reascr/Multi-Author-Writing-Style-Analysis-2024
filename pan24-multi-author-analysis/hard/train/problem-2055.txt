They do, don't they? Well guess what! It just happens that Russia has 300 billion dollars worth of assets frozen by the west.. Convenient no? what's 19 or 20 billions??
Actually, Russia has 300 billion dollars in the west and they were frozen as retaliation for invading a neighbor without provocation. That much money might even cover most or all of the aid packages NATO sent to Ukraine.
The West keeps the Ukrainian military supplied. The PEOPLE keep it functioning. If this weren't so, why would Put in be shelling the people over military targets? According to your 'logic' he wouldn't.
A tip: when you think you know something the whole world seemingly doesn't, it's usually because it's such a bad idea it was ruled out on day 1.
I don't support keeping people in place. I do support people who choose to stay and defend their country from being overthrown by a hostile dictatorship. Your logic is so flawed that I'm suspicious of your motives.
The people who wanted to leave already left. Everyone else leaving means the country ceases to exist. You can't just have a military and nothing else to keep it functioning. It's the most naive thing I've ever heard.
