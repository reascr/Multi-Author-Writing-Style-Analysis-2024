In addition to that, no prominent Republicans in office have actually criticized him by name yet, which means they're all still afraid of him. He's still the presumptive GOP nominee for president in 2024. All that's changed in the last week is that that has become even more disgusting and pathetic for the rest of us. But no, the GOP truly has no bottom that their depravity will stop sinking at.
It won't truly be over for Trump at least until prominent Republicans in office start criticizing him by name. None of them are doing that, even now after all of this. If none of them are willing to do that, then there's no chance anyone unseats him as the nominee. Clearly everyone in the Republican party still is too afraid of Trump to criticize him, which indicates he's still the standard bearer for the GOP.
Alternatively, those in the GOP majority who follow the party were probably very dismayed with Trump by what happened in the election. He's an easy target for them to attach blame to, rather than admitting that their messaging is also part of the problem.
I'm not sure that the poor GOP showing in the midterms would turn many of Trump's true believers away from their Dear Leader. They are part of a cult and will believe whatever reality he presents.
