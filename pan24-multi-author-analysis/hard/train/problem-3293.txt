You think LOSING is going to discourage mindless, fanatic nationalists? One of the biggest factors of the rise of fascism in Nazi Germany was the loss of WWI. "Our glorious army would have won the war if they weren't stabbed in the back by the civilian government.".
I wonder how history would have been changed if the war in Europe continued until the nuclear bombs were ready to use in summer of 1945. If Germany and Japan had both been struck by nuclear weapons I wonder what it would have changed.
Well, one likely thing is Russia wouldnâ€™t have developed nukes. The Nazis were doing well towards making nukes, and Russian forces captured nuke info from an overthrown German research area.
The Japanese actually came closer to building nukes than the Germans did. There's even rumors that they tested a nuke a few days before surrendering in what's now present day North Korea. There's even a Japanese movie about their atomic bomb project called "Gift of Fire.".
Yeah. Evidently our oceans are boiling. I did not know this until last week. I say we all launch everything we have. Planet of the apes style. The global winter should offset all.
