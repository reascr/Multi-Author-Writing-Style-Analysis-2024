TLDR : president of Mexico supports the ex president of Peru who had tried to dissolve its congress. US official met with new president of Peru, and president of Mexico wants people out of Peru's affairs /does not agree with state of emergency.
The second part refers to the US ambassador to Peru meeting with the new president and recognizing her as, you know, the actual president/government of Peru.
This focuses on Canada's recognition of the new president, but it also seems to have a reasonable summary of the situation in and around Peru.
Remember a week or so ago when the president of Peru tried to do a coup but no one supported him and his own guard arrested him?
Well, his VP was sworn in as president, and Peru has imposed a state of emergency because while Castillo (The failed coup president) didn't have the support of the military or police or anything, he does have some supporters and they've been protesting violently, as you might expect. That's the first part.
Heck yeah. Improvements have been made, but headlines like these are an example of how we can improve even further.
The problem is that news outlets must encourage their writers to make up headlines like this to make it seem like more of a story than it actually is. Their data shows more people click if they use words like 'slams' and 'blasts' than if they said 'criticizes.' Yeah, the latter is way more accurate but doesn't captivate the audience who hasn't seen those other words 1000 times only for it to be a big nothing burger.
