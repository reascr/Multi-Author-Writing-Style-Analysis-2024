Also the German demand was not honest. I am pretty sure that Scholz is primarily concerned that the US 2024 election will be won by Trump/Republicans. In his last term Trump openly discussed to Blackmail NATO Countries for the US Security commitment. With a possible returning of Trump it doesnâ€™t make sense to send the best German Tanks to Ukraine, without the same baking by the US, because the republicans could easily blackmail Germany, when Germany send most of there tanks to Ukraine and following that is highly dependent on US security guarantees.
An announcement about the tanks could be part of an attempt to break a diplomatic logjam with Germany, which indicated to the US last week that it would not send its Leopard tanks to Ukraine unless the US also agreed to send its M1 Abrams tanks.
The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send US-made Abrams tanks to Ukraine and could make an announcement as soon as this week, according to three US officials familiar with the deliberations.
The timing around the actual delivery of the tanks is still unclear and it normally takes several months to train troops to use the tanks effectively, officials said.
