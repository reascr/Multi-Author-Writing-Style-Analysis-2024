Actually for legal purposes I think this puts Fox "News" in a worse position. If Hannity said he firmly believed the election was stolen then hosting all the election denying nut bags could be legally justified. But saying he never believed it was stolen for a second, means he was hosting nut bags he knew were spreading false information. That "knowingly" part is key in a defamation lawsuit.
At the very least, should be a slam dunk defamation case since they're now saying they never believed it. "Okay, so let's play back some of the 100's of hours of you stating otherwise, while as you've started under oath was knowingly false.".
p.s.: I'd tell friar Tuck to put the kewl-ayyyd down, but he clearly loves it so feel free not to share this with him. Heh.
Good luck, Sean. Maybe next time, less "pundit character" and more "credibility as personal character". There's only so much mileage in cribbing from wrestling and soap operas, after all.
I tried to tell him when he left it was a mistake... but as usual, no one ever does the long-term cost benefit analysis.
Sean just preparing for the next network and trying like hell to keep his own bad choices from imploding his career before he can reach them.
