All I said was that Western media makes India’s problems look worse than they actually are. Literally every image of India on Reddit shows polluted rivers or slums even though 90% of the country doesn’t look like that. Same concept applies to the treatment of minorities. India is a multicultural nation with over a billion people so of course there’s gonna be friction. But you only hear about the bad stuff on here.
Those problems do exist in America, although to a lesser extent than other countries. I don’t know of any country that has zero crime rate and zero homeless people.
Right but you implied that people can’t comment about another country unless they’ve actually been there, but you’re doing exactly that. Quality of life in India is pretty good so long as you don’t live in poverty.
Our poorest homeless have better lives than some of the richest people in certain parts of india. That is simply unacceptable for a nation that wishes to claim it is the peak of human rights and above being investigated. <3.
