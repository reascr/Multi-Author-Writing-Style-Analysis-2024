It was the question without whether that 'memo' precedent was enforceable. We're not at the same time in the process of the whole thing as you're comparing it now.
The timing will be critical. I wouldn't expect indictments to come before the end of this year. So that happens in early 2023. Justice is slow. What are the chances that a trial happens next year at all?
Then the owners of capital said "oh yeah? You want higher wages? Fine. Here's a 10 percent raise. Now enjoy a 15 percent price increase. We'll make our money no matter what.".
Right. As an employee of the DoJ, Mueller could not directly accuse someone of a crime who had no ability to defend themselves in court … which Trump didn’t because Sessions, Rosenstein, Whittaker, and Barr would not charge a sitting president. We knew early on from reporting that a Special Counsel is not like an Independent Prosecutor, because Ken Starr went too way far against Bill Clinton and took away both the Pub and Dem appetite for that kind of prosecutorial independence. Instead, surprisingly, Mueller testified under oath that Trump could be prosecuted for obstruction after he left office. Which prompted Bill Barr to make a public declination on those crimes. It would be helpful if the OIG could show Barr was corrupt when making that declination, and maybe those obstruction charges could more easily be tacked onto Trump’s still continuing pattern of obstruction.
