Judges are important, but just a food for thought: who choose those judges? Can the judges themselves rule out candidates? Can the judges rule based on a vague law that they can use however they want?
"Can judges use vague laws to do whatever they want" is basically just ignorant concern trolling. Nobody who takes even a second to consider how professionalized and institutionalized/systemitized an advanced judicial system is could ever ask such a question.
What you've just described here is exactly how a democratic judiciary should operate: With a clear standard/test for constitutionality. Blocking unconstitutional amendments is the very job of a supreme court.
No, blocking constitutional amendment is not what a Supreme Court should be doing. The people should decide what makes up their constitution, not unelected judges. The Court should be able to strike down regular laws that violate the Constitution the people decided on, they should not write it themselves?
Justice Beinisch introduced the idea of an unconstitutional constitutional amendment, and gave the court the power to strike down those amendments.
The Court has rewritten laws, struck down laws, and gave themselves the power to strike down constitutional amendments. They are corrupt bureaucrats who rule the country based on their whim.
