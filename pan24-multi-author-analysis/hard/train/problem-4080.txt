I mean, it’s not really a “rule”. There is an agreement between US and Saudi Arabia for the “petrodollar”, but the reason oil exporters prefer U.S. dollars is simply because it’s the most widely accepted world currency. And that’s because they are incredibly stable and they have the least amount of risk of wild fluctuations.
Obviously these are volatile times as the world fights inflation, but the Euro is down 10% YTD, the GBP is down 10.76% and the Yuan is down 11.3%… and that’s why this is even a headline. Ghana is out of US dollars because everyone is trying to get them because their own currencies are rapidly falling….
I did just look at exchange rates though and the Cedi (Ghana) has been cut to a third of it's purchasing power compared to 3 years ago against the USD. That may be one of the bigger drivers of the switch to gold.
Ghana does have a GDP per capita of \$2,400 compared to Nigeria's \$2,000. But Nigeria is also 7 times more populous so it would make sense that they interact more with the US economy than Ghana does.
