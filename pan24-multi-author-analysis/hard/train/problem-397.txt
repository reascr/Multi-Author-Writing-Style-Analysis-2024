That comes from our own instinctual morality and cultural norms. It's actually been studied that when people are asked what god thinks, the same parts of the brain activate as when asked the question "what do you think." Religious teachings are basically just projections of the teachers' personal morals. So religion is mostly neither good nor bad, people/culture are going to do their thing regardless of whether it's wrapped up in religious ornamentation.
Yeah, I'd cheer that on, unfortunately, the people doing the book burnings are doing it because they think their religion is superior, not because they think that all of them are bad.
The fucks that are burning books are doing them so they can provoke Muslims (well, the stupid fucks on the Muslim side) into a reaction so they can rile people up against them.
But yea, often times the loud minority among Muslims has this vengeful reaction and it just ruins things even more.
What’s been in large part the problem with many Muslims’ reactions over the last few years is the demeasurate nature of their anger over relatively trivial things.
