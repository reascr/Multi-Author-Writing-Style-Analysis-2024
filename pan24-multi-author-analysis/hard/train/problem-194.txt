This is good advice. Iâ€™d just like to add that the man in this story has dual US/Iranian citizenship and was visiting family in Iran. People will take a lot of risks to see their family, and I certainly sympathize with that.
Yes, there's always the chance that just by being a dual citizen you can get in a lot of trouble - but people weigh those risks when it's down to big events that have to do with their families. It's not so cut and dry as "never go back to your homeland ever again" for a lot of people.
Also, I agree with this detainee that the US should do more. After decades of sanctions to tell us we need to revolt against our government and force regime change, time and time again when there are movements... our people haven't really gotten support from western governments. Now we're talking about 4 months of sustained civil unrest against the IRI... and there's still so many high level members of sepah/IRGC and the government that western countries are sanctioning.
The IRI is always going to claim that any unrest is the US/Israel's fault... so now that Iranians have spent 4 months doing what the west has asked them to do in the face of sanctions... maybe the US can do something more than a slow rollout of targeted sanctions and saying "well there's no way we can return to the JCPOA any time soon.".
I'm not saying the US should straight up invade, but there's definitely more that can be done than slow rollouts of targeted sanctioning and pretending like if we let a bunch of hardliner zealots "moderate" that the US can go back to the negotiating table. Iranians are crying out for help to end this monstrous rule.
