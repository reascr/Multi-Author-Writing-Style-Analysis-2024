>Russian priest Mikhail Vasilyev, who had suggested to Russian mothers to give birth to more children so they would not be afraid to send their adult sons to Russia's war against Ukraine, was just killed in Ukraine.

"The force of arms replaces diplomacy because it is the only language that Putin and the Kremlin are ready to understand" she added.
Analyzing the situation in retrospect, because in real time I didnâ€™t fully understand, it is clear Ukraine knew Russia would attack at least 7-10 days prior to the attack. And they were fully prepared. When Ukraine made those preparations, Russia should have aborted.
They just think that the Ukrainian flat refusal to listen to Russia looks bad. Myself, I think they could have in an answering service for Putin to call. Don't need to overdo it.
