Labor unions have long ago stopped functioning in the ways that made them a real threat to the capitalist world order. This has come to fruition, in part, through a complete breakdown of what little class consciousness the working class in the U.S. has ever had. And you see that as well with conservative union members of all stripes.
That and if the Democratic Party were actually concerned about "playing into the hands of the GOP" through a split with anyone to their Left, they would function very differently.
I just have to ask though, how is the Democratic Party shown itself as anything separate from neoliberal capitalism? Both parties ultimately serve the interests of capital above all else. Thatâ€™s why we see corporate profits skyrocket during social unrest, pandemics, and other crises. If aligning yourself as a socialist means upholding capitalism through the Democratic Party, how is it any different?
Yeah its been demoralizing to my pro electoralist, socialist arguments. I'm basically reduced to the core argument of playing defense against the onset of legalized fascism from the Republicans. But any hope of reforming this system down a long, long road to a social democracy that can create the foundational institutions for future socialism have extinguished.
