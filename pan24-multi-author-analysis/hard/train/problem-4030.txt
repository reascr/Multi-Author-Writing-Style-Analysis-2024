What we need is someone to go graphing of the casualties over time. I expect ukrainian losses were higher at the beginning. If ukraines losses are decreasing while russias rises or stays steady then they are on a path to victory.
If both sides lose a quarter of million each, but Ukraine can continue to take territory then they win by dint of control. There might be an issue however if Russia retreats behind their own borders and then continues to strike at Ukraine. What does Ukraine do then?
I think what they mean is that Ukraine may overextend. Ukraine is just holding the line and has been practicing attrition warfare, but if they rush down into the Donbass it could leave them vulnerable to counterattacks. Basically, Russia can't "win" anymore, but Ukraine can still lose.
Ukraine wants to hurt Russian occupiers and make this costly for Russia. (This gives them a target rich environment where they can pick any Russian target in their land as a legitimate target.
That means that Ukraine has so may opportunities to target Russia, and most targets are clearly military. With the current level of international support for Ukraine this looks like the political side will be a win for Ukraine because Russia is spending resources that are forever lost to gain land that they will likely lose in the final cease fire.
Ukraine wants to get international support for their defence, and seek "world court" type legitimacy for removing Russia from their territory.
