Medvedev failed to relay which countries would even be interested in this. My guess: Belarus and North Korea. I highly doubt China would ever dare to directly involve itself with a military conflict with the US/NATO.
I agree. Russia is pretty much all alone in this war and itâ€™s main resources are reputedly being depleted. At this point, I think Russia is desperate for foreign/external assistance.
I mean a lot of countries are hostile to the US or at least would like to see them not quite as dominant, but nobody is going to risk anything coming to Russia's aid.
So basically America is the global hegemon and Russia resents that and wants that for itself but knows it can't challenge the US and the West so it's bitter, and allies itself with 3rd world countries and dictators that have been wronged by the West in the past.
Coming to the realization that without Russia, Iran's suddenly a whole lot lonelier and it would probably be best to not give others a reason - however disastrous it would logically be - to try invading them without proper support to repel them.
With a population of 1.4B, they can lose military officials daily without much issue, as long as they don't end up fighting something as big the US military (nukes banned).
