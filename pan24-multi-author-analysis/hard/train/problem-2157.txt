There are methods. For instance, researchers at UC Santa Cruz were the first to sequence the human genome and they made it publicly accessible information. If a company had done it first, they could have possibly patented the information.
One possible solution for scientists is to patent their discovery, then charge no money for the use of the invention.
While publishing a discovery does allow anyone else to use that discovery/method without a patent, one can simply add a simple improvement of discovery and file a patent on that improvement. That alone makes it harder for anyone else to find a room to operate on previously published discovery.
Because of the technical legalities at a time, not to mention that modern medicine is a conglomerate of discoveries from different scientists. For example, the COVID vaccine is made possible by discoveries in RNA modification, nucleotide synthesis and RNA packaging among other things. For the COVID vaccine to be "open-source" everyone who has patents on these discoveries all have to agree to charge no money for the use of their patents, and at the end of the day, it would all just lead to the manufacturer who got permission for fair use to pocket all the profits.
he is quite literally singlehandedly responsible for the privatization of the covid vaccines so maybe work a little smarter next time at not doing that thanks.
