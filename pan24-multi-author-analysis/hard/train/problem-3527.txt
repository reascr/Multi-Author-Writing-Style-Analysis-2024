Some people will still be angry at those officials. But at the end of the day, most of the anger will be directed at the country itself or at the concept of FIFA in stead of the individual officials. And at the end of the day, they still have the money in their pockets.
It's pretty genius of those officials, from a purely evil point if view. The country gets a shitload of bad reputation. But the people who voted to have it take place in Qatar can just say "well, we didn't expect qatar to behave this way.".
Sure. If only Musk didn't waste so much money on Twitter, he could probably bribe them into doing it at some point.
The thing is, I imagine most of these people would first contact FIFA and ask them whether it was safe for them to go, before buying tickets. After all, this is all taking place under the auspices of FIFA.
This isn’t just FIFA. Qatar is just as open to blame. Just because there wasn’t a documentary about Qatar doesn’t mean they’re blameless here.
Lol if Qatar thought this would bring them tourism or rehab their image for anywhere that isn’t a Muslim majority nation then they’re delusional.
I don’t think Qatar even recognizes Israel as a country… but they’re kind of on the “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” boat with Israel re: Iran.
