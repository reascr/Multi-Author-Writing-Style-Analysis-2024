According to Google/Wikipedia, the Central African Republic's air force has between three and six aircraft of unknown condition, all cargo planes and helicopters, none of them newer than 40 years old. Their immediate neighbor to the north (Chad) has a vastly superior air force with nine old soviet jet fighters of unknown condition.
Hmm what a coincidence that the Air Force of neighboring Chad is staffed with Ukrainian mercenaries for most of its jet pilots. I wonder if they might have a bone to pick with Wagner for some reason lol.
If I remember correctly Chad purchased the jets, or at least the SU25s from Ukraine and I would imagine that package also included pilots and maintenance since I doubt that’s an area the Chadian military has a lot of specialists in.
Because Chad leased/purchased a number of Ukrainian MiG-29s and SU-25s, and part of the contract was that Chad would pay Ukrainian contractors to organize, maintain and fly said planes. The basically outsourced some or all of their Air Force to the Ukrainians.
There's not much of anything I can find that Ukraine is still there, are the aircraft still working etc.
Ukraine sold them the jets a while back and I’d imagine that package also included the pilots and maintainers on contracts. So they are contacted to the Chadian government.
