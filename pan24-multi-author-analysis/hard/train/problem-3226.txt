So, is that just switching to FPTP? Or do they mean still having a threshold for runoffs, but making it lower than 50%? Eg, you can win with a plurality of 45+%, but if the plurality winner only has, say, 40%, it would still go to a runoff?
But it's also possible to have runoffs with plurality winners. They could set the threshold at 40%, so whoever both gets the most votes AND exceeds 40% wins outright, but if the one with the most votes only got, say, 38%, it would go to a runoff election. This system wouldn't require majority support, but it would set a floor for a minimum level of support was needed to win (in my example, 40%).
It was her, but it wasn't just her. Lots of Republican officials and pundits were crying over how a majority of first-choice votes were for one of the Republicans, but the Democrat ended up being elected.
A ranked choice system would be best, but my guess is that Republicans will ram through a change to just require a plurality, and then advance a bunch of fake "liberal" third party candidates to split the vote on the left.
The runoff election was supposed to favor Republicans this time it didn't, so the system needs to be adjusted so the will of the people does not contradict the will of the party.
