As a former military man I’m rofl, you can’t make this shit up. Bad Ukrainian gifters, but bad police chief too, you both get a spanking for not clearing the weapon system properly.
Nope full liability. If you dint know what your doing with a weapon system you don’t touch it until you have a trainer with you, as a police chef especially he should know these basic weapons safety rules.
And while YOU know how to handle weapons, if you are going to assume that civilians also know it, I sure hope you are on a 24/7 supervision.
Except it's a civilian who was supposedly informed that the weapon system in question was not operational and safe to handle.
Additionally it’s stated to be a grenade launcher which is not a rocket launcher, but even common sense would dictate the same rules apply, if you don’t know what your doing with it you don’t touch it until you get help. I WOULD expect any reasonable person to know that you should not handle deadly weapons like they are toys, and I ESPECIALLY expect a senior police officer to know that.
Well, the police chief likely has not seen the type of launcher (or any launcher) before and has no reason to know how to safely handle one, so it's hardly his fault.
On one hand, yeah maybe not cool to give a loaded grenade launcher... On the other hand, the highest ranked police officer should not need any courses on gun and weapon safety...
And no, while most police officers will have handgun training (unless they work in the office, or places like UK), majority will not have anything beyond that, because they do not need it or want it. The situations where officers with such training are deployed are certainly not for everyone.
