More Russians have left Russia than the number of Ukrainians who have left Ukraine since the invasion.
Would you also deny Ukrainians who left their country because they didnâ€™t want to fight and die, and tell them to go back and defend their homeland?
As a side note if there is any demographic treated as poor as Ukrainians it's Russian resistors. Torture, murder, indefinite jail are what resistors have to face.
Someone else mentioned resistors in Nazi Germany. Same thing, they never were able to overthrow the Nazis and were never officially recognized as a resistance so they received very little foreign aid.
No one is aiding Russians attempting to oppose the war at home. They're on their own against a much more powerful and well equipped force in the Russian military/oligarchy and Russian government.
Resistors in Russia (despite how noble their cause) have no chance at successfully toppling the Russian government and the oligarchy.
Oh yeah my comment implies there are resistors injustice meant they're not getting any outside help l. No one plans on invading Russia and finishing the job so there's no chance those resistors will successfully overthrow the Russian government.
There are resistance movements in Russia and I will say I hear way too much complaining about Russians not resisting and not nearly enough about the ones who already are.
Edit: My main point still stands which is that the resistance in Russia has no chance unless they get more support.
And there are Russians resisting. The difference there though is resistors in Nazi Germany knew if things went their way Germany would be invaded and the Nazis toppled. That hope doesn't exist in Russia. No one plans on invading Russia.
