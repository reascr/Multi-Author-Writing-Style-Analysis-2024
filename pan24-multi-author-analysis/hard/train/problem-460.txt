Did the judge rubber stamp the warrant or did he have valid probable cause to sign it, based on what the cops said to him?
Yes, it is, and I saw nothing in the article talking about what the judge did wrong. Just that she lost the election and people were angry at what happened and the officers were charged. Still didn't answer my question on what role the judge played besides signing the warrant. If the cops lied, which we found out they did, did the judge know they were lying?
Oh no doubt. Agains, I was just looking for information if the judge played a role knowing the warrant shouldn't had been issued, or if she saw the evidence presented as truth by the officers and from that probable cause was there, and would any other judge had also signed the warrant based on the facts presented.
Because if he went by what the cops said, what happened to Breona is horrible. But that would be more on the cops than the judge. If I'm missing any parts that would make the judge just as guilty, then can someone chime in? Not really defending the judge as much as wanting a fuller picture of what the judge may had done that was wrong.
If a judge is going to do their due diligence on a warrant, police won’t take warrants to that judge for approval.
IIRC, the police said a postal inspector told them Breonna Taylor received a package at her address for her ex-boyfriend; a guy who wasn’t some high level drug dealer. But they didn’t provide any evidence of what the package might be or why they knew it was illegal.
