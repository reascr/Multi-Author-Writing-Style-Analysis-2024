Was that after or before the World Cup actually started. Since it’s started they banned the onelove arm bands. Which FIFA agreed with and told players it wouldn’t be allowed and they made a plane turn around for having a rainbow on it. Those quotes are irrelevant. Since the tournament has started. Qatar has made it clear how they feel about it. The journalist knew what he was doing and wanted attention.
The journalist who was arrested was very aware of the risk and consequences, and made the choice anyways. I respect that action, it shows bravery. The authorities detaining a foreign journalist because of an image on a shirt, can’t really find a reason to respect that, seems cowardly. So no, equal respect isn’t likely.
Lol, fuck off with the ‘equally respected’. Your values are shit, and aren’t worth the respect you think they are due. The majority of the criticism is from average westerners who have no say or means as to where FIFA chooses to hold the events, but at least they can express their critical views on reddit without fear of their government’s coming after them.
The people who are criticizing Qatar and the rest of the ME culture on reddit are most likely no where near the World Cup or will ever visit the region in their lifetimes, so the risk to do do so is low. It’s nice to be able to express oneself in cultures that allow it with low risk.
