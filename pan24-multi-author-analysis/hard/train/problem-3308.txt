It is France which had a big electricity problem in the summer (and they still have big problems) despite having 56 nuclear power plants. They needed to import a lot of electricity from Germany this year.
Though a certain amount of gas plants for electricity will likely still be needed even if other countries don't need electricity from Germany anymore. They are used for balancing out the electricity grid, compensating fluctuations which happen for example because of solar and win energy which are not steadily producing electricity. A nuclear power plant can't do this. It produces a steady amount of electricity and can't suddenly be put into a higher or lower gear.
Nuclear power plants don't produce gas, so they are not suddenly able to provide fuel for all the gas heaters in homes. And as France just showed, nuclear power plants have clear downsides. Also the industry needs gas for all kinds of things which electricity will never be able to replace.
Germany is using gas peaker plants to produce electricity. Thereâ€™s more than 30 GW worth of capacity installed in Germany that utilizes gas for electricity production. Each and every of those 30 GW could be replaced by nuclear.
