Hi, I think that's possible, but very unlikely. I don't think Russia is sophisticated enough to lay such a trap and I don't think Ukraine is daft enough to fall into it. I also don't think Russia will blow the dam, given the impact that would have on their positions south of the river, and the damage it would have to water supplies to Crimea. Thanks for the question. Regards, Dom.
Hi, they're ok, thanks for asking. We rotate them often and ensure they get good rest and whatever support they may want or need. It's taking a toll, of that there's no doubt, but we all believe in what we're doing and that goes a long way to fill up the morale tank! Regards, Dom.
Hi Dom if you are still reading. I am from Adelaide, South Australia and I listen to Ukraine: The Latest almost every day. I just wanted to say thankyou to you and the team for bringing this podcast to us. Always look forward to your daily synopsis of events. All the best!
Hey there! What do you think will happen if Putin is to die suddenly (and soon)? Will whomever gets in power next continue the conflict, or potentially withdraw and try to save as much face as possible?
