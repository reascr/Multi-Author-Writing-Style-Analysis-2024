Because of that, East Germany never had any de-nazification programs like West Germany did. It's a reason why right wing political parties have had more success there after unification compared to the western part and a reason far right wing parties have gotten more power in Eastern Europe in general after the fall of the USSR.
Interesting how the USSR would align with the west in a full cooperation capacity with the goal of fighting fascism together, yet made the most hands-off deal possible with Germany to buy time when this push for total alliance with the liberals was denied.
It’s a stretch to call a nonaggression agreement “aligned”, and to say Russia benefitted more than anyone is to be completely blind to the existence of the USA.
You’re as uneducated on the subject as it comes if you think Stalin saw Hitler’s beliefs as “similar” to his own in any capacity.
Stalin saw Hitler as an ally with similar beliefs. He was in a state of shock when Hitler invaded. He never understood that the Germans saw their race as lesser and in need of extermination.
