Yes I’m well aware of the Kemp issue and I think neither he nor Hobbs should have had an officiating hand in their own election. “What about” doesn’t solve problems. It only tries to justify continuance of a bad system.
And to use the term “refuted” about Lakes claims when that ball is still in play is irresponsible. It creates potentially false expectations which will in turn set people up for false outrage should the AG office investigation go the other way. It is much more accurate to say that Maricopa County officials have denied the allegations but an investigation by the State Attorney General’s office is still underway. Maricopa county is scheduled to provide responses to the AG Election Integrity Unit by Monday, November 28. Your comment doesn’t seem to acknowledge that. Were you aware of it?
But this thing about Trump being involved really boggles my mind. What it seems you’re saying is that Katie Hobbs made her unethical decision because Trump set a new standard for election denial? That’s nonsense.
That's false. The actual count has always been completed in one night. Many places like Florida still do it. There were 98 - 99% votes in after the first night and the Republicans swept the State.
