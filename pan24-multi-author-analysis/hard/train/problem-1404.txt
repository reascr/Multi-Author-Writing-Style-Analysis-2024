A lot of states have weakened the power of teacher's unions primarily for monetary reasons. The sad thing is most of the teachers and professors I know just really want to help their students learn. They do nlt have some hidden agenda other than making them critical thinkers.
I went to graduate school in Florida to get my Phd. Professors are scared to even use the word diversity in emails now referring to it as the "d" word. Whenever thought is punished, it is never a good situation. It is scary what is happening now in Florida.
I'm living in Florida hell. I have 3 years before my daughter starts school. I'll be gone in 6 months. Florida is going to start suffering from brain drain over the next few years.
It's funny the right claims to be against cancel culture yet when their orange god was president he tried to cancel anything he didn't like. People should always talk with their wallets it's the only way anyone listens.
When I first moved to Florida it was a solid purple state and I felt like it had a chance. Now? It's too far gone, lost to the right and I say fine let 'em have it.
