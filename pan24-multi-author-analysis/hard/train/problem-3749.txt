Kemp way outperformed walker. So the question is to those people bother to show up just to vote for him, do new people decide to vote, do the 2% libertarians show up for walker.
It's not really about getting new voters or even swapping voters, turn out will presumably be low and it's a question of how many of your previous voters you can convince to go back out to the polls again. The quality of each campaigns get out the vote efforts is going to be what drives this election more than anything else.
This election - like most elections- will be mostly about turnout. Get your people to turn out, and dissuade the other guys from turning out.
Many people can’t fathom voting for a different party. They’d rather vote for a lump of poo from their own party, because it’s their guy. These people see politics like sports - imagine asking a Georgia fan to root for Alabama. They just wouldn’t do it. Their identity is their team, their tribe… even if they know their tribe sucks. It’s not possible for them to switch to another tribe. They’d rather die.
