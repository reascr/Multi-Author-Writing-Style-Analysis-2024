Everybody: “Even though the US is the only thing keeping the Taliban from regaining control of Afghanistan The US needs to leave Afghanistan “.
I'm saying they wanted a foreign invading nation out more than they wanted the Taliban out. Ppl in this thread seem to just be glossing over the fact that the US invaded Afghanistan.
I'm not saying the invasion of Afghanistan was justified or not. All I'm saying is that the US was the invading force so comparing the afghani response to their "help" to the Ukrainian response is asinine.
The difference between Ukraine and Afghanistan is that the US would be defending Ukraine against a foreign invading power, while in Afghanistan the US was the foreign invading power.
Your example would only make sense if the US had entered those countries to fight another foreign invading nation.
Afghanistan would have if they were fighting a foreign nation invading their country. Oh wait that's exactly what they did. The major reason Afghanistan and Iraq were huge failures was because they used their ingenuity and adaptability to fight the foreign invading nation (the US).
