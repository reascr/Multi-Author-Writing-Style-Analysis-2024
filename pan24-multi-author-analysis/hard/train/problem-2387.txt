Right. He’s already the brand. Donald Trump didn’t come in and change a bunch of voters’ minds. He came in and publicly tapped into what they were thinking and feeling, and that republicans have been courting behind closed doors for decades.
Trump may have mobilized it to an extreme degree, but “Trumpism” has been at the core of the Republican Party for a long time.
Trump is just a recent ugly face on a brutal beast that Republicans have cultivated for 50+ years. Even the "never-Trumpers" voted lock step with Trump on 90% of issues. No one should let these monsters try to gaslight everyone into thinking they're better than Trump. They ARE Trump.
Trump is the Republican brand and has been for at least a decade. Republicans are trying to distance themselves again without actually changing anything about their party. I know it's worked times before. However, this is post-Dobbs the moderates aren't going to forget that anytime soon. So unless the Republicans actually start changing their platform they will keep losing as long as free and fair elections occur.
