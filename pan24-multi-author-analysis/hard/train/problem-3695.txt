I'm kind of surprised it's not standard procedure. Frankly, I kind of assumed it would be. Just a basic flip through filing cabinets and boxes at places an office holder would normally have taken documents as part of their job. Hell, right down to members of Congress on their way out. I have a feeling we'd find some with any elected official that would have them as part of their duties.
This just shows there should be oversight when an elected official of any kind leaves office. Really not hard. The honor system obviously doesn’t work. However, Biden having docs doesn’t concern me nearly as much as the boxes Trump had.
Biden’s team let him down and Biden really missed the mark here, as soon as Trump got popped he should’ve done a clean sweep of all his homes and all his documents.
Biden likely did not intend to keep the documents and they got lost in what’s probably quite a LOT of paperwork that even a VP has to deal with. Once they were found his team contact the archives and informed the DOJ and is now asking the DOJ to sweep his residences for more.
Too many people are reading this as “Biden is trying to show he has nothing more to turn over but they keep finding more.” This isn’t how the DOJ is likely to interpret his cooperation and frankly is a poor assumption to make.
Biden inviting the DOJ to search is the same as saying “look we found stuff we know was classified but we’re not 100% sure there isn’t more, can you verify.”.
