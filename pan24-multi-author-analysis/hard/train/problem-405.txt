This is just a sneak peek into the gridlock that is the US political system. It’s explicitly designed to be hard to do anything. The democrats have tried passing many liberal policies, but they always fail. The only time policies can pass are when they are quite watered down to get more centrist politicians on board. This is why most of the radical policy changes happen through the Supreme Court.
One complication is that the Senate has a 60% threshold for most legislation, when the party in power typically has 50-55%. So unless the left and right agree on something, it’s not passing. Another complication is the elections of the two chambers, and the president, which all happen at different intervals; 2, 4, and 6 years. This increases the likelihood that the party in power of each of the 3 don’t match, also preventing major legislation from passing.
This is one of the downsides of democracy, sometimes the one you want the most for office won't win the election and sometimes the most unacceptable garbage will win. Good thing you can try again four years later.
Btw I put bad guys in quotation marks because it depends on which side you are. I'm Brazilian and even though I believe Bolsonaro is a piece of shit, for his supporters he was their savior.
Before anyone call me a right-wing nut, I could not be happier from seeing Bolsonaro leaving the country as the loser he is. His whole family can go fuck themselves for all I care, as these fuckers have also publicly supported nazis and Brazilian criminals from the Ditadura era.
All in all, neither side has saints. Supporting dictators and crimimals is always bad, whether it is from the right or left side.
