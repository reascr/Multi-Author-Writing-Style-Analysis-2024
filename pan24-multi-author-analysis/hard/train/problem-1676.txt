BRUSSELS — The mysterious blasts in September that hit the Nord Stream gas pipelines built to carry Russian natural gas to Europe were caused by “gross sabotage” and investigators have found traces of explosives, Swedish authorities said Friday.
The explosions in late September rocked a key pipeline that carried natural gas from Russia to Europe at a time when Moscow is using energy as leverage in retaliation for Western sanctions over the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine.
Russia stopped the gas flow through Nord Stream 1 earlier this year, citing technical problems, while European leaders accused Moscow of trying to “blackmail” countries that have sent weapons to Ukraine to help fend off Russian forces.
As I literally just said, Europe had already committed to moving away from Russian gas before the NS1 sabotage (and before Russia cut supplies) and was moving towards importing from other sources:
Russia was withholding gas, Europe did not stop, the carrot was always there inciting dissent in Europes population (there where demonstration for opening NS2 for example and normalizing relations to Russia), that got taken out with the attack (at least severely limited).
Although the explosions initially raised fear of shortages, the impact on European supply was limited, mostly because the European Union had already started weaning itself off Russian energy.
The energy crisis pushed European countries to build up reserves and find alternative sources of supplies ahead of the winter, as Russia cut off flows and energy prices rose. E.U. countries have also rushed to tighten security around key infrastructure and boost naval operations since the pipeline explosions.
