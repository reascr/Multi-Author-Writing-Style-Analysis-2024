That’s why you see Kelly winning by 5%, Fetterman winning by 5%, Shapiro by 15%, Whitmer by 11%, Warnock by 3%, Evers by 3%, Polis by 19%. Dems did insanely well in key swing states because moderate voters were afraid of the GOP.
But in a state like Wisconsin where the GOP gerrymandered themselves to a supermajority, the governorship is the only thing stopping it from being a one-party dictatorship.
That’s why the GOP did well in safe Dem states (California, New York, Illinois, Oregon) because there was no fear over their policies being implemented due to the heavily blue state legislature.
I mean the GOP underperformed because, even with some electable candidates (Laxalt, Fung), they really didn’t do enough to move away from Jan 6, election deniers, and anti-abortion views, which ruined them in suburbs.
Trump is right, abortion rights is an issue that affected GOP performance, but he also has a lot of blame for this occurring on top of his general poor performance in picking candidates and irresponsible and criminal behavior.
