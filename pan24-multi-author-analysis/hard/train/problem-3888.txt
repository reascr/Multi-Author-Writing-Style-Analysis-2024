So much time in healthcare is wasted trying to get medications, tests and procedures authorized. If insurance was taken out of the equation, healthcare workers would have more time for actual patient care.
Keep in mind, it can be solely to provide insurance, and not that the government employs the actual doctors and all the health care workers.
The whole country should be the insurance base, and basic coverage for everyone. it's an enormous pool to pull from. The bigger the insurance base, the better it works.
I've hit the "out of pocket maximum" in the last 2 months of my 'health care year', then it reset and I hit it again in the next two months. that is $26,000 mother fucking dollars out of my pocket for someone with full coverage insurance in a 4 month period.
I have pretty ok health insurance now and I still have $1k/month taken out of my paycheck to cover myself and my wife and daughter. I got a bug bite over the summer that ended up getting infected. I went to urgent care (which is also my PCP) when it started getting hot and swollen and they lanced it and gave me antibiotics. I paid a $15 copay, paid like $30 for the drugs the perscribed, got a $15 bill from Labcorp because they took a sample to test, and got a bill for $240 bill from the urgent care place. I called BSBC to ask why the fuck I paid $240 for the visit and it was all legit and part of my dumb plan.
