As a Canadian, if you took Alberta provincial politicians and fed them lead for awhile, I think we would be tied. But it would have to be a cereal bowl a day for at least 15 years.
So you got the rednecks and the oil workers along with farming/ranching all kind of depending on each other and all expecting their leaders to ‘whip Ottawa’ in shape. But those voters have zero idea how it works, how little power the provinces have in terms of forcing anyone to bend to a single province, and as a result they elect someone new every time thinking this one will be different. That person ultimately signs a deal with their constituents (devil) and always answers the bell for it. Lunacy.
Right now she’s already admitted the process has happened by complaining to the press she isn’t getting time/attention.
Nope. She’s already castrated herself. That’s a good (bad) politician in Alberta vs what they have in the US. See in Alberta people are simple minded and just want their oil money. Either job or business running off oil. It’s all oil. And as a politician you gotta get things done. These turkeys never have experience in large scale diplomacy. They come in hot and ferocious. When you come into a leadership acting like you hold all the leverage against the federal government what happens is they just ignore you.
Many GOP states don't even realize they would be FUCKED without the federal government letting successful state subsides their failings. Looking at you rust belt.
