I'll grant you that the reason behind it being Omar specifically was probably her ethnicity and some of her statements. But they were kicking someone off when they got the chance, specifically because it was done to them. They threatened to remove people from committees immediately after Greene and Gosar were removed. This is the follow-through on that.
I can see that argument, but at least in the House, they're not that focused. If it was McConnell, I'd agree with you; out of the current GoP crop he seems to be the most mechanical (and even he's pretty vengeful; see blocking Supreme Court nominee). But McCarthy and the rest of the House Rs are a lot less disciplined than Senate Rs and tend to be pretty cantankerous (see: Speaker fight), so it's more likely to my mind that they're just reacting.
If you look at the Republican behavior of the last thirty years or so, vengeance is a significant motivator for a lot of their actions. "We got a Mueller Report, so we're retaliating with a Durham Report (that catches Trump in a financial crime)." "We got Nixon, so we're going to impeach Clinton." So on and so forth.
Also. I lost all respect for her after her Ukraine comments. She can't walk that back no matter how hard she tries. All of the talk of being opposed to colonialism and imperialism went out the window.
