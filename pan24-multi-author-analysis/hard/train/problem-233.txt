3) Speaking of steering committee - they want to open it up to “regional representative” positions. Again...to kick out establishment R's and get the loons in there.
5) This fun one....eliminate proxy voting and restoring the ability of any member to make a “motion to vacate the Chair,”. Essentially a motion to oust the Speaker at anytime. Again - Boehner had to deal with this bullshit. I'm sure McCarthy told them to go fuck themselves in regards to this.
6) Another fun fucked up request....restore the - allows amendments to appropriations legislation that would reduce the salary of or fire specific federal employees, or cut a specific program. HFC wants this so this so they can jettison Fauci, kill programs they don't like, etc.
4) "Open the legislative process" - a rule to require that all legislation considered on the House floor is allowed amendments, or allow amendments supported by at least 10 percent of the GOP Conference.
This article did not mention the proposals for term limits, anti-lobbying measures, and banning stock trading by members of congress in office policies that the far-right wants voted on because they know the GOP establishment won’t let those rule changes be proposed because Democrats would vote for them.
