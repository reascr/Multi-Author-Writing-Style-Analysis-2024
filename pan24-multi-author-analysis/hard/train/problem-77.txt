One of my oldest, best friends was talking about how both parties suck, and how he wanted to vote for that dipshit Brett Weinstein "unity party" bullshit.
I started off calmly, but eventually was kind of bugging out, and essentially said "you can throw away your vote and help the republicans win because you're a straight white male in a white collar career. Millions upon millions of people will be hurt in myriad ways if republicans win though, so please please please, I know democrats aren't even close to perfect, but please don't contribute to making this country worse for everyone who isn't as privileged as you ".
"For the last two years, Democrats in battleground states have played defense against Republican efforts to curtail voting access and amplify doubts about the legitimacy of the nationâ€™s elections.
Well, Republicans have been stifling voting rights since I was old enough to know Republicans exist.
Republicans attacking voting rights is the current battle that we must win. But the sentiment expressed above is the forever war.
