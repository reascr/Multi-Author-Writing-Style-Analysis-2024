"Dead language" just means it isn't a primary language for anyone, but instead is used entirely for scholarly/religious purposes. Like Latin. Thousands of people speak Latin, it's used in the Catholic Church all the time, but it's still a dead language.
A dead language is just one that no longer has a community speaking it natively. Under that linguistic definition Sanskrit and Latin are both dead languages despite having works written in them and people able to speak them.
There are different definition of the term "dead language". However notice that a language in the definition you describe is not dead. A language that is still used for communication doesn't have to be dead if it has no native speakers.
Also having degree in linguistics doesn’t mean you know every inch of the world. I am pretty sure being Indian I know more about India If not all than you, unless you are an Indian too. So keep your ego aside and try to respect what others are telling you. Hope they taught you to that in your linguistic degree. Unless there is spacial class on “don’t listen to anyone because I am a westerner and I know everything - 101”, then its different story.
Unfortunately you didn’t learn to read someone’s reply in your linguistic degree. Again have some education and dont be egotist about your degree.
