This just unadulterated madness. Especially in the age of cell phones. IThe Iranian regime doesn't give a fuck!
Fuck Iran and its government, fuck people for trying to marry religion and politics. Its never about which religion is worse, its always about who controls power.
Did they rise to power because they were religious? Or because their was an unstable political regime that fueled their rise?
It was not about religion. The major rebellion rose from famine and socio-economic reasons, famine caused people to move for labor, rich people took advantage of the cheap labor, only making it worse, ontop of high taxation and a weakened han government, rebellion was imminent. It just happened to be a religious group that rose to prominence in a chaotic period.
Were they rebelling because they were religious? Or because the system of power sucked? Religions suck yeah, but when given a platform to take power they sucked even worse, not because they're a religion but because they used military power.
