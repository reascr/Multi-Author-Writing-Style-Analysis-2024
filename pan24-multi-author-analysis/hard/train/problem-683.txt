Sounds like a reverse Brusilov Offensive from WW1. There the Russians sent out highly skilled squads to probe for weaknesses in the Austro-Hungarian lines, blow them open, and then the human waves come through. It proved so effective that Austria-Hungary almost got knocked out of WW1 and the Brusilov Offensive is considered to be the greatest Allied victory of WW1.
However, the Offensive was still costly for the Russians - so much so that it contributed to the Russian Revolution a year later. So imagine that, but the Russians made zero progress. That's basically what's going on in Ukraine right now.
I'm pro-Ukraine in all of this, but this shouldn't ever be forgotten.. While Ukrainian nationalism right now is a good thing for liberation.. Left unchecked after the war, it could devolve into something more dangerous.
Don't forget operation Barbarossa and the Ukrainian auxiliary police who collaborated with the Einsatzgruppe in pogroms.. And Vinytsia. Ukraine largely collaborated with the SS during the Holocaust.
In the (mild) defense of the Ukrainians during WWII -- they were caught between the USSR that had already been steadily genociding them and the incoming Nazis.
As a Ukrainian Jew, whose grandpa fought through the end of WW2, and whose two great-grandpas perished fighting in the same war against Nazis, I can't emphasize enough how false this statement is.
I don't mean to excuse what they did -- but it isn't like resisting the Nazis to side with the Soviets was going to seem like a great idea either to many of them.
