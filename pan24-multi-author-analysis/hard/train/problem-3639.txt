Lived in NY all my life. Yep. Drive through Queens and you can see hundreds of families that are packed in like sardines. No idea how the fuck they park, and the streets are so packed and narrow as it is. I guess you get used to it.
You might be right. I've seen lot of seismologists saying it seems like a second earthquake, but I see that USGS states it as an aftershock, so yeah. More analysis will make it clear.
All the other ones are aftershocks. There have been more than 400 aftershock earthquakes so far and they will continue unfortunately.
There is a high risk of aftershocks in the areas after an earthquake. Normally, the plates move about two centimeters per year. But that's an average. It is actually a kind of elastic in which the energy is stored until the pressure becomes too great. Then the plates can suddenly move meters.
The plates can collide with each other, slide under each other, rub against each other or drift apart. This is often associated with earthquakes. The strongest earthquakes occur at the edges of those plates.
Turkey lies on several so-called tectonic plates. These are pieces of the earth's crust, the outermost layer of the solid earth. There are seven major tectonic plates and several smaller plates on our planet. Those plates move a few centimeters a year, but that can already have major consequences.
