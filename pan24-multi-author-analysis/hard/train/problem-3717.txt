The main problem is the rich taking everything and leaving people in a state of deprivation which leads to sick mindsets like white supremacy offering false answers.
If by a bunch of old white men owning or affecting the value of almost everything and/or making laws to bestow and keep powerâ€¦then yes, we do have a white supremacy problem.
What are you talking about when you say that black people stood in line to send a black democratic senator back for a full six-year term because of...white supremacy?
Fixating on racism isn't bad because it makes people feel uncomfortable; it's bad because it blames all sorts of problems that have nothing to do with racism on racism.
People who want to duck this by saying WELL ACKSHUALLY IT'S A CLASSIST COUNTRY are deluding themselves because thinking about racism makes them feel bad.
It doesn't make me feel bad to think about racism, but breaking everything down to fixate on racism isn't working, in my opinion. For one thing, it's alienating potential allies and creating division.
