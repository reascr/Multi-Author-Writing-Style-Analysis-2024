Canadian of immigrant-ancestry here, thank you for sharing this - I and everyone I know agree with you + believe this. Colonizer capitalism needs to be reshaped/taken apart. hoping to help support the expansion of indigenous sovereignty/treaty-obligations as topics in the broader political discourse + more. thank you for explaining.
TLDR: Canadians broadly agree with the concept of healing these old wounds and support the indigenous, but vary widely on what that means practically (is it just politics language-magic? or a real money-down commitment?). The momentum is going in the right direction, but the movement is facing growing challenges + an exhausted, increasingly-stressed electorate that may be due for some austerity measures. No consensus on action, but the work seems lightyears ahead of where things are in the U.S.A re: native peoples - and that's the foundation imo for much bigger future work to come. Would welcome an indigenous perspective to learn from here, and again I speak only from my experience.
Treaties among Indigenous people are a spiritual and evolving concept. In other words "Honor the spirit of the treat.".
Native American Cree here from Manitoba originally. This shit is a hot mess. Long story short. Brits signed treaties with Indigenous people due to a lack of resources to fight the "Indian Wars" against them. Indigenous people signed up due to starvation.
You're probably of European ancestry. My people trace our beginnings here. So you have magical powers called white privilege.
