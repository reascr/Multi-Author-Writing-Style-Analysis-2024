… The cause of recidivism isn’t “prisons are too nice.” It’s a society that undermines the formerly incarcerated and their right to a normal life at every turn.
Let me get this straight - you think the recidivism rate indicates people who WANT to be in prison? Moreover, you think these people who want to be in prison return DESPITE the low pay? As if they would happily go back inside sooner except the pay out here is just so much more enticing than what comes with their little concrete and steel home.
As for your soap joke, the idea that men who are incarcerated so long that raping other men seems like a good idea to them seems funny to you tells me all I need to know about your sensibilities.
Granted, the article ignores the fact that the sub-$1 per hour pay is only part of what a prisoner gets from the state. There is also food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. You're saying that the sum of these parts equals acceptable compensation for holding a prison job, even one that could prove fatal as in the case of fighting wildfires. However, to pay anyone other than a prisoner to do these jobs, the government would have to spend a minimum of three times what they currently spend merely keeping each prisoner alive. The fact is, food, clothes, shelter, and medical care are part of the minimum quality of care the government is required to provide prisoners. So the pay prisoners receive for working - which is a small fraction of minimum wage - is given for doing jobs that the government couldn't get any free citizen to do even for minimum wage. Which is, in fact, a form of slavery.
I was about to be mad that slavery is in quotes but now see it is a correction. The article just wanted to not remind people America still has slaves. I appreciate some abolition work being done however.
