Testing out slurs to see what sticks. Will people pick up on it as a fat insult from an obese man? Will Italians get angry at Trump and abandon the cause? Will Italians identify with DeSantis and back him? Will this cause an ethnic rift? Trump uses chaos as a ladder and has the ability to end GOP careers like no other.
DeSantis has a short shelf life. He isn't weathering this while Trump wears himself out, he is looking weak by not defending himself. Trump has this luxury as a bully with no dignity to fling shit and not see the downside to himself.
It’s a classic Trump double whammy of insulting his pudgy and red faced appearance (bonus points for zero self awareness) and racism. This plus the ease with which it rolls off the tongue is why it has genuine sticking power (as opposed to the far less inspired “DeSanctimonious”).
This isn't to say the hogs are ideologically anti-Italian, they don't really have an ideology and would probably laugh at this just because it's directed towards a perceived enemy.
