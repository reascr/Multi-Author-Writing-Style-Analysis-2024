Are you telling me there were zero deaths in those millions of people caused by car accidents, heart attack, illness, cancer, or any other cause you can think of?
1- This figure includes deaths from all causes, whether they are from construction accidents, heart attacks, car accidents, cancer, and any possible cause you can think of. The real deaths from the world cup construction activities could be one thousand deaths, one hundred deaths, 500, we don’t know. I don’t think we ever will know the real figure. But to say that 100% of all the deaths for those nationalities in a span of 10 years were caused by construction accidents is just ridiculous. There are literally millions of those nationalities living and working in Qatar, but to say all of their deaths in a decade was caused by nothing but the world cup is laughable.
6,500 migrant workers (slaves, they had their passports stolen) died in Qatar during the 12 years from when they were awarded the World Cup.
Claim: "The World Cup in Qatar has cost the lives of 6,500 — even as many as 15,000 — migrant workers.".
. Men, get out of tiktok and we will have a conversation. "Josep Borell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, compared Europe to a garden – and most of the world to a jungle" The idea that you can criticize a problem without doing anything to solve is ludicrous, the idea that you can criticize countries like Qatar and be best friends like the USA is ludicrous. And my English is better than c1, hahaha, that you can not understand allegories and learned English from tik tok, is not my problem, go to school or something, maybe read some books You know what an allegory is too advance?
