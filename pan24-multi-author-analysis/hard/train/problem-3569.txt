And I'm not gonna do a big back and forth, Canada has shown time and time again it takes a forgiveness approach to violent crime. It has shown over and over again victims don't matter and that fine if you wanna live in a society like that. I don't. So take care bud.
This will always vary by state, or in this case perhaps country. For instance in my state a first degree murder carries a 6 years to life of course other factors can be factored in.
1st degree and 2nd degree murder (for adults) have the same minimum sentencing of 10 years to life. The difference is the possibility of parole after 10 years.
"Three of the girls are 13 years old, three are 14 years old and two are 16 years old, according to Det.-S. Terry Browne of Toronto police's homicide unit.Â Three had previous contact with police, he said.".
This is not the case. It's about how the person acted in the killing, was it planned vs unplanned, manslaughter would be killing without intent.
Definition: Generally, a deliberate killing that occurs without planning and does not fall under any of the categories of first degree murder.
Definition: A homicide that is both planned and deliberate. An example of this is a contract killing.
Because not all crimes are murder. Not too fussed about shop lifters or vandalism, in a lot of places that's part of growing up and I wouldn't want people's lives ruined over that by being tried as an adult. Add any other petty kind of crime that those rules exist to protect children from their mistakes that I missed.If they fucking killed someone they MUST be made an example of. It sets a disturbing precedent if they don't face the most serious punishment.
