- For Biden and Xi to meet, the two sides worked for months behind doors to secure a 2.5 hr appointment and agenda. They discussed only a few impt. topics.
- Xi thinks that Trudeau probably took advantage of this unscripted meeting to make Trudeau seem more legitimate than he is (when Xi doesn't even want to give Trudeau time of day).
To his domestic audience its not unreasonable and that is who he is playing towards so they can spin it as Xi snubbing Trudeau when that wasn't really what happened it was just impromptu side lined that often happens a lot at these types of events for world leaders.
- China finds Canada's actions in the Meng / Huawei / European lobbying situation particularly frustrating and at this point Xi doesn't event respect Trudeau enough to talk to him.
- Xi thinks Canada represented by Trudeau is the little brother of the US and doesn't even deserve a seat at the table with China given the poor relations.
You can tell by Xi’s dismissive comments and hand gestures that he thinks all other countries are inferior and that Canada must beat to China’s drum and do things “their way”. Fuck…..that.
