NATO is ready for a direct confrontation with Russia, but the alliance must rearm, the head of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, said in an interview with the Portuguese RTP. In his opinion, Russia's strategic aims are beyond the borders of Ukraine.
There's also some lessons learned from Ukraine that will require us to reassess what we think we know about our own capabilities.
Imagine what China could do to the US navy with their own manufacturing and RnD capacity put towards naval drones.
There's still a question to be answered about how those drones are even capable of getting anywhere near a ship. Why are they not picked up on radar? Is it pure incompetence? There's no technical reason, western radar is able to pick up submarine scopes. The drones shouldn't really be a threat in theory.
After that any Chinese drones are kind of useless. Taiwan's navy is no threat to China and probably wouldn't likely last far beyond the start of the war so the drones will have little practical purpose beyond that. They're not a war winning weapon.
It means that Taiwan's planning is likely to be effective if their weapons survive the initial strikes. They have literally thousands of anti-ship missiles already, many with longer range than Ukraine's missiles.
They're more useful to Ukraine because they can push the Russian black sea fleet back where their missiles can't because they don't have the range.
