if I remember correctly, he was a veteran that gave up his American citizenship to become an Australian citizen. Unless Australia doesn't allow for dual citizenship, the fact he gave up his US citizenship means he could be disillusioned with how the US treated him after he left the military.. either that or he doesn't want to pay US taxes while living in Australia.
I was thinking more of how the US government 'took care' of him and other vets after they left the service. Or maybe something happened during his service and he felt betrayed. But the simplest reason to give up his citizenship is probably due to tax purposes.
My argument is if you expect to have the full benefits of a US citizenship, then you need to pay into the system despite where your income originates.
If someone takes a job out of the US but maintains residency in the US, then, from your explanation we should agree taxes to US are due.
I’m not too concerned how other countries operate as I agree with the US that if I want to maintain my citizenship and it’s benefits, then I should expect to pay some form of taxes.
But if you're an American citizen living in Australia or Italy, you still need to pay taxes to Uncle Sam, even if you haven't stepped foot in America for decades, let alone used American government services. AFAIK no other civilised nation uses this double-tax system.
