no. because many would not be making the trip, but also because of layovers and very indirect routes, and also because this argument is plain false- per passenger, per km, planes are magnitudes worse than cars.
when enough people get together for a plane trip and 15,000 jetfuel is purchased, the same transaction also creates 60,000 gasoline, as well as 30,000 diesel... the combined demand for all of these products sets a price for each of them. demand for jetfuel creates "magnitudes" of other things, planes and cars are not in competition.
Because someone said passenger flights burn “a magnitude more” fuel than driving, let’s do the math. Average Boeing 787 Dreamliner holds 300 Passengers. Fuel Load for a maximum trip (6,300 miles) is 33,000 gallons. Let’s consider a trip across the USA, California to New York (2,915 miles). The distance in question is 46% of the maximum range of the plane, so it would be loaded with only 50% of its fuel capacity (16,500 Gallons). Let’s assume it all gets burned (it doesn’t, but whatever). Now let’s take those same 300 folks and put them in 200 cars (1/3 of the total are driving together). Let’s assume they are driving average cars, pickups and SUVs instead of electric, hybrid, etc cars, so we are getting an average of about 20 MPG (probably less, but again, whatever). The distance of 2,915 miles at 20 MPG would result in a fuel burn of 146 Gallons of fuel per car. 146 Gallons x 200 Cars = 29,200 Gallons of fuel… nearly TWICE what that single passenger plane would consume, despite all the “whatever” guesses in the favor of the cars. 🤔 A “magnitude more” fuel would mean the plane would be burning 1,000% more than the cars. Clearly, with this, the commenter can be seen to be wrong.
If the 200-300 persons per jet were instead driving 200+ cars, overland, for the distance they were flying, would that not generate vastly more pollution? 🤔.
