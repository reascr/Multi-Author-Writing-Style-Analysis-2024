Russian propaganda needs to create the false narrative of fighting an enemy bigger than Ukraine. The actual west is fine with Zelenskyy making the demands and he very much wants Crimea back.
What do you mean by "back to where it started" if you mean all of the annexed territory by Russia, minus Crimea, yes. But what do you expect out of this war truthfully? A demilitarized Crimea isn't as big of a loss as the whole south of the country or even just donbas.
People need to look at the historical context for treaties. There was no realistic outcome of this war where Ukraine, or the west, gets to decide what happens to Moscow, that fate is already sealed anyway, and maybe you are underestimating what this war will do to the country internally, in 20 years from now I bet the map of Eastern Europe and Central Asia is going to look massively different as a result of what's happening today. What Ukraine gets here is pretty massively favored to them being able to survive a dying regional power on their doorstep.
That being said, putin isnt invading my country so I'm sure the people of Ukraine probably feel way differently given the losses they've suffered this war and the blatant disregard of sovereignty.
