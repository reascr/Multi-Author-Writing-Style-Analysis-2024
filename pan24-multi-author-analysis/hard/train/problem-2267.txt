This just really does not occur. No one would make accusations of antisemitism if criticizing Israel was just dispassionate criticisms of Israeli government policy. Instead, every single post about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is filled with people calling for Israel's dissolution, comparing it to Nazi Germany, whining that "Jews didn't learn their lesson from the Holocaust", and calling Israelis "white European colonizers". That shit is straight up antisemitic.
That's antisemitism, full stop; it is not, in any way, a criticism of any policy of the State of Israel.
You are denying Jewish indigeneity to the Levant and instead claiming the Arab colonial invaders, who genocided and ethnically cleansed Jews, are the real indigenous people.
The thing you have to remember about "Palestine" is that it is not a nation, it's a Pan-Arab colonial outpost.
The Arab occupation of Judea & Samaria is no different than the Russian occupation of Crimea: fundamentally imperialist and colonialist with the goal of seizing everything, not peace.
