America still has people in prison for possession. What a fucking insult to so many people who are here at home in prison and not in a place who has a less than a one percent acquittal rate for marijuana charges. It is a weak ass negotiation with a terrorist nation.
Honestly don't care what she was going through it was her choice to break the law in another country that any reasonable individual would have seen the potential risk she was taking in a place that convicts 99 percent of those with weed charges and it is still illegal here so I don't see why she was worth trading a merchant of death for.
How does it help? Cause It fucking doesn't. What you're saying is we should worry about the dummies abroad breaking other countries laws that we still uphold over a literal international arms dealer.
Probably because, bear with me, this is a hot take: We shouldn't have traded one of the most prolific arms dealers for someone who chose to violate another country's laws.
Ehh when we have thousands locked up at home in our own country for the same shit but yea let’s trade an arms dealer for a domestic abuser that hates America. Very bad trade.
This whole situation is shitty. We need to stop treating this as a win. Brittney Griner fucked up and Biden ate crow to get her out. She deserves to face some kind of punishment for putting us in that position in the first place. This isn’t a left issue or a right issue. This is a national issue. She fucked up.
These articles are really forced. I voted Biden and absolutely would again over any Republican, but this Griner situation isn’t great. We’re allowed to criticize him. We’re supposed to criticize him. He’s a public servant. Not a king. Biden bowed to Russia’s demands and handed over a very dangerous man in exchange for a medium profile celebrity because of the optics when we have thousands of people imprisoned in our own country for the same charge. A US marine is also in prison in Russia.
