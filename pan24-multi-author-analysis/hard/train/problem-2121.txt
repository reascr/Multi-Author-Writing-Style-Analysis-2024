According to USAToday as of about five minutes ago there are four counties that are still yet to be finalized - Pueblo, Pitkin, Garfield, and Rio Blanco.
and IF each county shakes out how it’s currently trending, then Frisch could net another 2200 votes over Boebert which would put him up by 1800 at the end of the counting process.
With about 7,500 votes left to be counted in Pueblo County, per this article, and Frisch having a 54% to 46% advantage in that county so far, we can extrapolate that forward to say that it's possible he gains enough net votes over Boebert that her 433 vote lead gets erased, leaving him with a 170 vote lead.
Based on my math, she leads by 433 votes right now but if the remaining Pueblo county votes adhere to the 8% favor that Frisch has there so far, that’s a difference of 600 votes, which would put him ahead by 167 votes after they’re counted.
Still a couple thousand to count, but probably as many votes left in the rural counties combined (most reporting at 95%) as there are in slightly Democratic Pueblo. Going to be razor thin.
That most recent dump came out of Otero county, which is very right-leaning. Remaining votes are more pro-Frisch.
And this district has a history of running repeat candidates. If she wins, Dems will run Frisch again on the message "now that we know we can beat her, let's beat her" and it might just pull some more people out of the woodwork — especially in a general election where democrats could get a boost.
