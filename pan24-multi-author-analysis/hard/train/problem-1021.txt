There's no reason to think we're close to that point, but moving in that direction is a bad thing. This thread reeks of, '"What are you going to, stab me?" - man who was stabbed' vibes.
Russian nuclear doctrine calls for a nuclear first strike under certain conditions. There's a reason why there's no Western troops in Ukraine. There's a reason why the West places limitations on Ukraine on attacking Russian soil.
The US affirmed yesterday that we do not place limit on Ukraine attacking Russian soil. The West only puts limits on Ukraine using anything we have given them to attack Russian soil. They can do as they please with their own weapons.
The West refuses to participate in Ukraineâ€™s target list inside Russia or Ukraine. The West believes that even discouraging Ukraine from attacking inside Russia would constitute our being part of the war because, by participating in selecting targets, we would be involved in waging it. We want no part of this war beyond giving Ukraine arms, training, equipment, and humanitarian aid. No one is willing to risk cross that line.
