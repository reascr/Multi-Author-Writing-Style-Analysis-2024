Since people really like espousing Malthusianist views online whenever this topic comes up, it's important to note the projections.
The UN Population Division report of 2019 projects world population to continue growing, although at a steadily decreasing rate, and to reach 10.9 billion in 2100 with a growth rate at that time of close to zero.
A 2020 study published by The Lancet from researchers funded by the Global Burden of Disease Study promotes a lower growth scenario, projecting that world population will peak in 2064 at 9.7 billion and then decline to 8.8 billion in 2100. This projection assumes further advancement of women's rights globally. In this case TFR is assumed to decline more rapidly than the UN's projection, to reach 1.7 in 2100.
An analysis from the Wittgenstein Center IIASA predicts global population to peak in 2070 at 9.4 billion and then decline to 9.0 billion in 2100.
If you look at the current world map for total fertility rate, only portions of Africa (+ Afghanistan) still have very high fertility rates.
If anything it's a good sign, because if people were getting poorer the world over fertility would be going up, not down.
A declining birthrate is not necessarily a bad thing. It is usually an indicator that a society is prosperous (such as wealth and educated) and tend to have less children as a result.
This means that a world where everyone is wealthy enough to afford all the healthcare, education, fulfillment, etc. they need and want is one where the couples that do have kids only have one or two, maybe three kids.
Survey after survey reveals that women want to have more kids. The simple fact of the matter is that they feel can't for a number of good reasons. That is not empowerment; that is the opposite. Even recently the US added women to the draft. Of course drafting women in their prime child bearing years is going to have predictable effects.
