Well it's a welcome change from Germany's blind to the world energy policies over recent decades. Maybe they will actually contribute to NATO and their military as well so that they don't have to rely on the US to protect their continent.
Yeah solar and wind are extremely cheap and a good investment........but they don't fucking work when the sun ain't shinning and the wind ain't blowing. It's easy to turn those gas plants on to replace the irregular energy sources and they are reliable and really easy to turn on but they burn fossil fuels. You need to have baseline electricity that works day and night, windy or not and as we've seen in Europe and Germany is that they're still burning coal to make sure they have that reliable energy source during winter. Nuclear is carbon free and can replace those fossil fuel plants that are still needed all over Europe and now that they've been cut off from their cheap source of gas and are entering the global LNG market those gas power plants are going to stay a looooot more expensive to run than it was during the easy Russian gas days.
Hmmmm well that energy charter treaty sounds like a pretty good way for companies and countries to receive long term support for investing in a 0 carbon form of energy, like nuclear but the Germans wouldn't want to build power plants that have proven to provide baseline energy reliably. Much easier to quickly build a few more gas plants and improve slightly statistically but not focus on how to reliably power their countries carbon free for the coming centuries.
Nuclear is maybe carbon free(at least when the fuel rods providing energie, not the plant and all the process around it) but it is for sure not the cheapest and arguably not saver than solar or wind. I don't get all the hate Germany gets only bcs they don't go nuclear. Like pls, if they manage their goal without it be happy.
