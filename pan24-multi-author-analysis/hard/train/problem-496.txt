Merry Christmas, Ukraine. You know, for all the talk from Russians about how Ukraine is their brother country and they love the people, they sure don't seem to act like it.
Whatever Russia's problems were at the end of the USSR break-up it pales in comparison to the damage that Putin & Co. did, not just to the Russian people but also the Chechens and now Ukrainians.
It's always had problems but they had a few military (WWII) and industry successes and many cultural traditions. But with Putin in control that only exists if he says it does. Thus it's Russia in name only and the rest of the world should just call it "the place of Putin" or "Putinovo".
Genuine question here; the whole world (sans Iran and China and perhaps a few others) is against what Russia is doing. How does it affect our allies any differently by changing Russia's status to that of a terrorist state?
I was just wondering the Middle East gets flak but why does Russia not qualify as a terrorist nation? They even have nukes and submarines. Isnâ€™t that more murderous than suicide bombers?
