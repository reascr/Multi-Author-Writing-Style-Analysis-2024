The video is good. But although I can agree with him on the general principle, he deals very dismissively with the point about how the other countries will care for the artefacts. This would vary on case by case basis and I dont think it should be ignored.
This isn't just something you can glance over by pointing out the dumb things the british museum did in the past, realistically the standards between countries vary greatly.
I get his point about accessibility and that it's both hypocritical and often inaccurate (because the items are often not displayed). But there's a difference between returning something to let's say Greece or Peru, and returning it to a currently very unsafe country that's ripe with terrorism and corruption (yeah clearly there's corruption everywhere but all I know about Nigeria is that it's a whole different level).
There has already been cases if this occuring, of course Nigeria is actually a quite developed and stable country, but it still has terrorist incursions and a lot of crime/corruption of a type more likely to be dangerous to precious items than most Western corruption.
