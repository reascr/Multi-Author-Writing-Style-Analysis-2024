Part of me doesn’t like this bc it isnt free speech and the other part of me likes this bc journalists are getting a taste of their own medicine. Duality of man.
This post is about Rupar, who engages in a lot of the stuff I listed. Idk about the other guys, they are probably nice people. Like I said I’m torn on how to feel :/.
You are right, they are not the same thing, as I just said in my comment above. They are separate processes but the results are the same (bans). Sounds like you don’t like consequence culture either, maybe the journalists banned in this article are just facing consequences for their actions 🤷🏼‍♂️.
Journalists have been banning people from social media for having done nothing which violates the site's TOS?
Twitter has suspended the account of prominent liberal journalist Aaron Rupar as well as reporters from CNN, The New York Times and The Washinon Post.
Rupar, who has more than 788,000 followers, had his account suspended the day after Twitter suspended then restored an account that followed the movements of the billionaire’s private jet.
