They would still need some kind of support or at least silence from their Arab allies & Turkey. Itâ€™s likely they will strike Iran nuclear facilities soon, they have done it with Saddam before.
Because Iran getting nuclear weapons would just set off a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region. You can bet on both Saudi Arabia and Turkey seeking nuclear weapons, with Israel militarizing even further, and much more offensive military action in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Lebanon, and Iraq.
Will be interesting to see if the US/Israel try to drum up support for any military action (see places like Saudi Arabia for instance).
On the other hand, if Israel launches a preemptive strike against Iran, it sets a dangerous precedent. Not only will Iran and Israel likely be committed to full-scale war, they will drag the US and Russia into it, complicating an already bad enough situation in Ukraine. This is the kind of thing which leads to true WW3.
If Iran gets nukes, it will completely transform the middle east forever, in a likely bad way, considering how unstable it is without nukes. Religious radicalization is a bad combo with nukes (including Israel), and they will certainly proliferate through the region in the same way as NATO has done through Europe. This is bad for the survival of the world.
If Israel does nothing, it's also possible that Israel could be nuked off the map by a throwaway rogue Islamic faction, if Iran sells or gives nukes. Doesn't even have to be Iran launching the nuke.
