He hired a paramilitary security detail to serve as his bodyguards, I was there when he pretty much paid them with over PhP 1.25m cash and despite all that, one guy went rogue and took most of the money and the guns. The head of the detail suspected that personnel got bought out by the opposing mayor.
Corruption in the US still requires a lot of hoops for bad actors to jump through in order to pull off, I'm not gonna deny it exists( ) but as long as it isn't eroded, it still requires a lot of effort to do so, and the practice itself isn't integrated to the overall culture of the country.
As much as Americans complain about corruption in the US, the systems in place make it hard for bribery and corruption from being a thing.
To me, US politicians look extremely corrupt, and overtly so. Just looking at cases such as , where the word "corruption" isn't even used by anyone, which tells me that this is just ordinary politics in the US, whereas in my country I doubt the politician would be allowed to stay in office.
See it's not corruption or bribery because for one it's legalized so it gives an air of legitimacy and we don't call it that, but what else would you call a certain interest group making political donations to a politician that is closely involved in said interest group's sphere of interest (e.g. a committee chairman, lead author of a bill, or governor of the entities home state)?
