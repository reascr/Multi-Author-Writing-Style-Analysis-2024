Nothing specific unfortunately. Just random stuff popping up in my usual social media feeds. And it's nothing gucci. Just the basic shit like uniforms and load bearing equipment that should have been issued to conscripts on day one. Such as found in this video (clips near the start) of some new troops being trained (treat with a grain of salt, looks from an official source).
Russia's air problem is that it has way more airframes than it has pilots and maintenance crews. And every lost pilot isn't getting replaced anytime soon.
Highly unlikely if its daily flights. Russia had to reach out to its allies when it found that the stocks reserved for conscript forces had mysteriously turned into yachts (1.4 million uniforms only existed on paper for example). There's a notable improvement in the equipment on Mobiks captured by Ukraine.
Just realised you were saying Russia is supplying China with this stuff and not vice versa as I'd originally mistakenly read. That being said, your post doesn't make much sense in context as we're wondering what China is supplying Russia.
If Russia's really lucky maybe China is supplying military advisers who can tell Putin just how badly Russia fucked up without getting pushed out a window.
God the fucking irony that Putin has a hard on for physically expanding Russian territory like we're in the middle fuckin ages, and that at the end of the day it might be the Chinese that annex his land.
