it looks like the city is aiding disenfranchised people in need, its better then them being reduced to homelessness and relying on emergency services.
If they're disproportionately homeless than a program set to help homeless people would disproportionately help them, thus what's the need for a program that specifically targets them?
My bottom line is that when it comes to poverty and homelessness, all folks in that category deserve help. Creating a divide within that community that says one group within it is more deserving really undermines the larger issue at hand, and makes it sound like there are people within the at risk population that somehow just don't deserve a hand up.
I agree it should be extended to anyone at-risk or experiencing homelessness. This sorta sets up a dynamic of "well yah but this group of people is more important than those imminently facing homelessness". Boooo. I do understand and agree with programs to help marginalized populations, but when we're talking about critically needed income assistance to the impoverished in general, I don't think it's the right arena to be creating divides with regard to who deserves it more inside at-risk populations.
I'm under no impression that generalized programs to try to realistically end homelessness would ever happen though, because we know how people feel about caring for the general well-being of their community. Even inside deeply liberal cities there's a lot of quieter "NIMBY/F-ck you I got mine" attitudes.
