Whatâ€™s amazing is Walker might be one of the worst major party candidates for Senate that did everything wrong and had nothing but bad press for over a year, and he still only lost the runoff election by 2 points and was down only 1 point in the general.
Walker was such a preposterously bad candidate that I can only think he did as well as he had was due to TOTALLY RIGGED FRAUD.
It's so crazy to me that Republicans are complaining about "Candidate Quality" as a euphemism for absolutely terrible candidates. There seems like there's only two situations and both of them are their own fault.
1. This is who the party voters want and the primaries bring the strongest candidates to the front. If they're terrible it's more a problem with the party than the candidates. Stop electing terrible candidates.
2. The party leadership is throwing all their funding behind their handpicked candidates and pushing them to victory and they're terrible.
you can just look at the result kemp got, and its very obvious the GOP's insistence on running abysmal candidates lost them the race.
