A Russian nuclear strike on a NATO nation would be met with the complete annihilation of Russia, most likely through a singular retaliatory nuclear strike followed by overwhelming conventional warfare. Hopefully, further nukes wouldn't be deployed but there's no guarantees of that.
I agree with this post entirely if Russia nukes Ukraine, but if they launched against a NATO country, a nuclear response seems inevitable.
My feeling is… again this is my opinion… Russia gets away with using one nuke. It will be on nato and the rest of the world NOT to retaliate and so restraint and the kremlin can easily blame it on Ukraine. Two is out of the question, it will be WW3 if they do… but I just don’t see them getting out of this without making such a show. Remember world: we have power, which seems to be the one thing the Russians are most upset about: pride.
They are pissed and embarrassed with what has happened and when the next offensive fails, all hell is going to break loose. Putin will either be assassinated or will die “naturally.” And then one of these power hungry thugs will have the nuke codes.
