Contempt charges certainly seem appropriate here. Trump and his lawyers literally had to be dragged kicking and screaming into complying in any meaningful way and continued to try to obstruct Justice while using their soap boxes to try to sway public opinion against the FBI and justice system for the purposes of sowing doubt in MAGAdittoheads.
It was "Repeated refusal to designate a custodian of records to sign a document attesting that all classified materials have been returned to the federal government" according to the article.
One of the key areas of disagreement centers on the Trump legal team’s repeated refusal to designate a custodian of records to sign a document attesting that all classified materials have been returned to the federal government, according to two of these people. The Justice Department has repeatedly sought an unequivocal sworn written assurance from Trump’s team that all such documents have been returned, and Trump’s team has been unwilling to designate a custodian of records to sign such a statement while also giving assurances that they have handed documents back.
I’m wondering if no lawyers on his team actually want to be the one who attests that all documents have been returned, because they know Trump is always lying and they know he’s probably hiding more. They know that Trump would lie to them, his own legal team, even if it hurts his own legal strategy.
Team Trump: "What, and face consequences if we're lying? Ha, no way, it's not THAT kind of promise. Also this is a witch hunt!".
