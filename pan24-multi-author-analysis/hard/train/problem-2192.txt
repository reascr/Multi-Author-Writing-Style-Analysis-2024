Mirage have lower maintenance requirements and would be a good choice for Ukraine. The F-16 has some logistical nightmares like hydrazine powered APUs, but the mirage can and is operated by less capable air forces than Ukraine.
The airspace in Ukraine is contested at the moment, but giving Ukraine jets with solid air to air capability even more difficult for Russian aircraft to operate and will help with .
Jets is going to be really difficult because of high training requirements to be useful in the way Ukraine wants. Russia has the fighters but still can't use them because their pilots simply aren't well trained enough to pull off SEAD/DEAD, so if they use them they just get obliterated by Ukrainian AA.
Ukraine won't be able to take control of it's skies either if it can't run SEAD/DEAD missions and the training requirement is extremely steep. Like, we need to get them training now so maybe they can do this next year, and that's assuming they learn as quickly on the jets as they did on the HIMARs.
