Headline quotes an opinion piece columnist. Maybe it's my US politics exposure clouding this, but pundits spouting BS about opposition party politics doesn't seem terribly novel.
I think I see this as it being best for NATO to have Finland and Sweden as members. Erdogan wringing everything politically possible out of the situation, but it's still politics, and there's still (presumably) negotiations happening meaning all his demands don't have to be fulfilled.
My guess is it's all political theatre, there's constant negotiating behind the scenes, and after Turkey's presidential elections next year are over and Erdo's gotten to act like a strong man making demands of the rest of NATO and Nordics, he'll suddenly announce he's gotten satisfactory assurances or whatever and will accept the application.
My guess is they've discussed it behind the scenes and once Turkey's presidential elections are over Erdo will suddenly make a statement about having received satisfactory assurances from Fin and Swe and they're welcome to join.
Erdogan as well as Turkish ambassador to Finland gave assurances to our leadership of how Turkey would view a potential membership application favourably before we officially applied. A lot of the demands they've made are also things that could be interpreted as having been filled already under the status quo, save these demands for giving over certain people. I'm sure he's getting some actual concessions too, but it's probably not quite as dramatic as he's playing it up to be.
