Well, have any paintings been destroyed? Do these protesters keep accidentally targeting paintings with protective covers like they're in some comedy skit?
Its interesting how much time people spend criticising the protestors instead of the oil companies in these threads when literally no art has been damaged by these protests. I think people on reddit just hate liberal young people.
No piece of art has been damaged in this series of protests. You'd notice if it were because it would be in the headline like this "Protestors destroy art to combat climate change".
They could start by gluing themselves to practically anything else high-profile that relates to climate change instead of artworks. That's something they haven't tried yet.
Higher profile doesn't include those things if they didn't gain much attention. But why is that in an age where almost anything can go viral? Were they noticed or not? What was the response? And did it have a net positive or net negative effect on support for ecological goals?
Doing something that makes their movement look stupid and turns it into a punchline is worse than doing nothing.
That makes it even dumber, because people are still going to get angry about what sounds like damage to the paintings. So now they need an extra step to explain it was fake vandalism before they can even get around to explaining how real or fake vandalism of paintings is supposed to relate to climate change.
But why not attack something that is actually relevant to climate change instead of random art? It makes no sense. Go throw paint at a CEO, or destroy a factory, or block a pipeline. Art has zero to do with this and really makes no sense to destroy.
