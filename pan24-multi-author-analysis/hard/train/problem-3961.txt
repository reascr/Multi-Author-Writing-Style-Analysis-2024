Agreed with what you said tho....anti mccarthy could probably just walk out of the building, let the chips fall and call it a win because they fought for themselves for their constituents.
One the house side, its be a nightmare. McCarthy can't reason, beg, or work with them. The maga wing has him by the nuts and they aren't about to let him become speaker without some heavy concessions.
ya its been fascinating (from a poli sci major) and terrifying (from an american citizen standpoint) to watch the maga power struggle. McConnell was pretty good about not allowing the crazies into the senate or at least whipping them into line.
It's funny that McConnell is seen as some political genius. Yes, he was incredibly successful in ratfucking the judicial branch, but that was sheer luck. You don't call someone a genius investor because they went all in on their hand and it happened to be that they won the bet. You call them a reckless gambler.
Now the consequences of his gambles have started to show. He got Trump to jackhammer his judges, now he has Trump wrecking everything else, including losing the Senate.
