Not "unprepared"... negatively prepared. As in, it seems most people are prepared to actively reject any kind of measures meant to alleviate the spread of whatever the next pandemic is.
I think most people and most governments have learned nothing from this pandemic, the management was a complete disater, not the virus. Lockdowns didn't help anybody, they destroyed the economy, fucked up psychologically millions of people, now we have tons of excess deaths due to people who were at home scared of going out or couldn't get out and their illnesses went unchecked, cdc literally admitted making up the 6 feet thing (which is till in place now in some places ffs), pfeizer literally admitted lying about the vaccines stopping the spread of the virus, which made the jabbed feel safe and the unvaxxed being marginalized, ending up with tons more infected. Politicians showed that they didn't care about the mandates they were pushing themselves, having fucking parties in the middle of a pandemic...
Now who's to blame if there are so many people who don't trust the government? Well, looks rather simple to me, the government itself. That's what happens when you lie to people over and over again.
