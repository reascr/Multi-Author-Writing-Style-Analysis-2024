I'm one of those people. I apologize so much I've literally been reprimanded about it at work, haha.
100% agree on what you say about abuse killing who someone is - that's how I describe it when I talk about being sexually assaulted. I physically survived, but the person who I was disappeared afterwards. Whoever I could have become, that person died before I had a chance to find out.
It's a classic trauma response. We all know about "fight or flight", but there's also the "freeze" and "fawn" responses. The "fawn" response is a common one with abuse victims, especially child abuse - they just do whatever they can to placate the abuser. They say whatever they can to make it stop. They try to be as pliable and submissive as possible to not be a target of the abuser's rage.
Abusive partners do everything they can to make sure that's not even an option. Control their finances, manipulate them into being alienated from friends and family. All sorts of fucked up shit.
Also abusive people tend to look for those who are most vulnerable and have a smaller safety net to fall back on.
