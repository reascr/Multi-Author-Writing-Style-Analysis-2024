FYI, we don't know what variant of the Sea Kings are being sent. Nobody has mentioned the anti-submarine version, although it is possible. That requires the dipping sonar etc.
All that said, it would make sense to give the Ukrainians that capability since it's clearly something they need since the Russian surface fleet is no longer a threat.
Anyway, the scenario in which this protects Ukraine is when Russia fires missiles near the border, so that Poland can claim that they were protecting their own airspace.
The argument of “If we give Ukraine our equipment we’ll have less for ourselves” forgets that you stockpiled all that tech to defend yourself from Russia. And Ukraine is actively dismantling Russia’s military!
And probably destroys more than a Euro of Russian military capabilities, which honestly is why the military equipment was manufactured in the first place.
Russia are FULLY escalated apart from nukes which they cannot use because they know NATO will annihilate them, so sending Ukraine everything cannot cause escalation, which is often cited as a reason for not sending anything.
The Russian's genocidal actions, and their use of torture, has erased any logic behind the acts of surrender or of ceding territory; both would mean a worsening of conditions under Russian control.
