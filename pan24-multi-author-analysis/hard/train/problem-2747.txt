I agree. But the idea in of itself is completely absurd one - there are a number of reasons I think that but maybe the most obvious one is a question in what she thinks would happen if red and blue states did separate into individual countries? Red country just has a "Republican" party and the Blue country just has a "Democratic" party? Nope. As long as elections are still held for political office then factions of parties would appear and compete and would ultimately boil itself down to two major parties again and we would end up in pretty much the same place in both countries. This means that if one of the countries (not gonna point fingers here) wanted to avoid this inevitable situation then they would have to eliminate the democratic process and essentially have a dictator. If the "red" country wants to be purely Republican then they would end up a Fascist regime since basically the Republican Party is all that matters and all within the country must submit to it.
I mean red and blue have already sliced up and divided controlling America, what about the majority people that don't vote for either party and would like them both to kindly fuck off, the real divorce America wants.
If the "divorce" happens, very little would change in blue states while the people in red states would just become (let's be honest it would be literal) slaves to the giant corporations who would own/run everything.
And fuck anyone else who wants to split the states like that, not only did we settle this damn argument in 1865, most red states have big blue populations and a lot of blue states have big red ones.
As someone who lives in a state that would be purple or blue without the damn gerrymandering, sincerely...
