And that squad member is correct. Members of his own party don’t wan’t America’s slave history to be taught in schools because it makes white kids feel guilty.
In addition to setting us back in the fight for equality by saying asinine things like racism doesn’t exist and slavery was a choice.
As a black person, it’s a different kind of self hate to be a black conservative. It’s not racist to bring up race.
Nah, we all know that they're racists and we also know that he's complicit in that racism. He should own that CHOICE without it being assigned to the Republican party and removed from him.
Sure. But I'd argue that the problem is the belief that a Black person can't agree with them without being a prop.
This isn't taking agency away from a black man because he's black. It's because he's a black man already setting himself up as an enabler of white supremacy by denying CRT, denying the US has a racism problem, and shitting on the legacies of people like MLK (who he claims would agree with him).
How can you look at Donalds, who is very really denying what is a reality for much of non-white Americans, and think he's not either an idiot or a liar?
