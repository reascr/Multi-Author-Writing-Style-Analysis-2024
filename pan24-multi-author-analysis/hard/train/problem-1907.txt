This implies that Australia is ever at risk of being invaded. It is not. It is too big, too sparsely populated and too far away. China does not have a blue water fleet, I doubt it ever will for a loooong time, so being blockaded isn't a possibility and even if it was, no power can currently blockade all major ports with the exception of the US. Australia has train connections across cities to bypass a blockade. Lastly, Russia is a non threat.
None of China's CV's are capable of blue-water travel. Having a blue water navy means having the capacity to deploy a task force of ships across the open ocean, and to support them at great distance from their bases. None of China's CV's, either produced or in planning, have a nuclear power plant to power them. This means they are incapable of global reach without a massive support-fleet in tow, which ofcourse makes that support-fleet a likely target. Think about it:
This is a big part of my thoughts on it. Comparing it to the Bosphorus is a joke. You got like 30 countries nearby to aid support if any issues were to occur over that very short passage. Meanwhile the Northwest Passage is 1,450 kilometers long (900 miles) long and it's really only Canada there to handle anything that may happen. IF they are in the right spot the US may be able to send aid from Alaska.
As far as the US is concerned, Canada may as well be Minnesota or Alaska. If shit hits the fan, Canada is going to be defended as if it was domestic territory.
