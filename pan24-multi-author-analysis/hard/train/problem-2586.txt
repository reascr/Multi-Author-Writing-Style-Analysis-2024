This will probably be dismissed. But coming from the left, with a lot of friends on the left. There is a lot of criticism of DEI. Not because of its goals, which I agree with, but because of how it's implemented. For my job we had a week long dei training that everyone had to attend. A few problems.
They made discussion impossible. The q and a session was very limited and all the events (we attended probably over 20 speakers in five days) were more lectures than they were about discussion.
The speakers came off as preachy. Having some white women speak about racism, to black people... Is cringe and weird.
Its like saying ‘Civil Rights’ has passed no more discrimination in the country! When in reality we still have heavy discrimination to this day.
White people always say "there is no racism. So stop bringing it up" There IS still racism!. My fucking white family still uses the N word behind closed doors. And they aren't the only white people who do that. I'm not going to sit here and ignore that.
I'm sorry they are scared of the truth, but it's reality. We will never ever be a better country if we continue trying towhitewashh everything about us. Being in fucking denial is no excuse.
