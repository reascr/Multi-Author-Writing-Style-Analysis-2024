To this specific instance. It’s just the same shit they believe of themselves applied to their cult of personality. The guy is an embodiment of all the things they believe God wants for the world, so he’s free to take some liberty in messaging how awesome he is. In fact, this might be a true statement as far as they’re concerned. God set the world in motion, and afterwards he created his special boy Ron to come and fix it in the only era that matters, the one in which I’m alive.
It’s not a principled adherence to the tenets of the faith, it’s a fake point system through which they can believe themselves to be better than other people because they believe a little more devoutly than the next person.
Conveniently God hates all the things they do, and though he imposes some restrictions on their life, he understands why it they had to have extramarital sex, or get an abortion. It wasn’t their fault, it was the devil preying on their weakness. Everyone else though? Rotten sinners.
God made sinners, too...and dung beetles. Ron DeSantis is a dung beetle made special by God. Add link to YouTube video showing what dung beetles are best at.
