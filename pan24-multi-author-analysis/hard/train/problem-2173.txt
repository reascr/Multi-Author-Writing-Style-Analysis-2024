"The American nationals arrested were named as Alexey Brayman—a lawful permanent U.S. resident who lives in New Hampshire—and Vadim Yermolenko, a U.S. citizen living in New Jersey.".
True. It depends though if they were naturalized (is that the right word?) themselves or 2nd or 3rd generation immigrants. You do need a certain personal history in order to pass the cultural vibecheck of the country you're applying for citizenship for... or you can fake it.
I'm kinda disappointed by yall not seeing that two US citizens of Soviet origin IN CONTACT WITH AN FSB OFFICER might, just MIGHT have had pro-Russian sentiment all along. It's not really the same as accusing hundreds of thousands of immigrants.
edit: why would you get triggered by that? Two US citizens. That's not hundreds of thousands of wrongly incarcerated US citizens of Japanese origin during WW2.
Most Japanese wrongly incarcerated during WW2 were already living there for a generation, if memory serves right (Nisei). Or at least aligned to the American way, mindset-wise, if 1st generation.
