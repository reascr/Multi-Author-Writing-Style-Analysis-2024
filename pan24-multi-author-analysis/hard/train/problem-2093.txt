You clearly don't know what you're talking about. First of all, these reactors are all housed in containment facilities that can withstand the force of a jet plane directly colliding with them. 9/11 made that fear something to think about. They've withstood damage so far, and if Putin wanted them blown up he could have done so without shelling them, especially as he has the staff essentially held hostage.
All accidents so far have been counted and its still one of the safest, maybe not the safest, so I doubt this release will seriously impact those figures. Fission is dangerous when mishandled and anyone who's studied nuclear physics, like I have, knows that, acknowledges that and understands that treating nuclear power with respect and transparency makes it a safe resource to use.
The effects of this release, and whatever they are they aren't zero, conveniently won't get reflected in the statistics this group shares when they say Fission is the safest, purest, most wholesome power source god has given man.
I dont believe nuclear power is anywhere near safe enough yet, and I believe nuke power advocates are way too eager to risk the ruination of entire continents in the name of conserving them...
