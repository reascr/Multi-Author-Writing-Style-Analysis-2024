I assume they'll pay an intern to pull up all of trumps impeachments, cross out trump and write in biden.
they have gerrymandered enough of america that all their concerns are about reducing the edge of every trump and republican contrapoint.
That's why the laptop thing happening, or the hillary emails or whatever. If there's republican scandal, their job is to create a pseudo-scanadal of similar sounding for a democrat.
I would rather nothing happen and the democrats spend two years blaming republicans on not even being able to elect a speaker for nothing happen than two years of hunter bidens laptop and impeachment of joe Biden for wearing a tan suit.
I doubt it will happen but lmfao at even the remote possibility that republicans are so incompetent they won't be able to seat a speaker before the next election.
Moderate Republican speaker might be a better outcome for the country but its not a good outcome for the Dems, so I think it is unlikely. The small number of 'old school' conservative voters who might swing are motivated to do so because of the whackos that have been let in to the GOP. Putting an effective moderate up front has the potential to draw those back.
