There are many types of mines. The mines you see being pushed around the road or even picked up normally are usually anti tank mines. They are made to be set off by a tank or heavy vehicle and a person can easily move them around unless some anti tamper system is set up.
Anti personnel mines come in many forms and are all much smaller and much more difficult to move or clear than at mines.
Then there are areas where they might be the occasional mine, or where 'scattered mines' (delivered by rocket or even artillery) might have gone off course and left the area dangerous. And unexploded shells that might go off if you hit it with a plough.
Basically, if you're a farmer and want to plough a field after a war like this, you need to treat the whole thing as if it were a mine field, even if you can't find any evidence that it was mined. You're going to disturb every inch of the field, and just one device could kill you.
The problem with mines that that there are 'mine fields' that are known about, mapped and even marked, and then there are the ones that weren't documented or marked. Any field the Russians have occupied might have been mined.
