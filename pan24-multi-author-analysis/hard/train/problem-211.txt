A lot of the "he's a total loser who keeps bankrupting all his businesses" talk doesn't really reflect reality. But I think you can look at the moron try to hock NFTs and know exactly what kind of "businessman" he is.
I'm not defending the guy, he's a scumbag, a con man, and I don't think he's particularly good at what he does. He does know how to sell his image though, and that gets him far. But I also know a lot of successful businesspeople who have had multiple businesses go bankrupt... It doesn't always mean they are bad at what they do.
What Trump does is grow his businesses, and then separates the revenue from the expenses. The real estate rules are such that he can claim the expenses and depreciation now without claiming the revenues and gains yet. This essentially leaves him with just enough "losses" to offset his income and he pays no taxes.
(also, these are separate corporations. Going bankrupt with the casinos and steaks doesn't mean HE went bankrupt.).
Again, that’s my point. It’s almost impossible to not make a bajillion dollars in deductions and donations when you’re wealthy. Or even when you’re poor.
