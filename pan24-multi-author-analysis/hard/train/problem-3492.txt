They all vote differently, but white Latinos tend to be a lot more right wing than othet groups and their countries have the racist history's to show it.
The thing is that there was a similar shift among black voters though not quite as large as among latino voters toward the GOP in 2022 from 2018.
This is where everyone stumbles on the Latino vote, it's very dependent on who you're talking about.
Right, yeah if anything it helps to think of Latinos as the ultimate swing voters. They mostly align with democrats on values but they are hyper-sensitive to the economy since they mostly are trying to live the American dream and build a life for themselves. If the economy is good, then democrats will do well with Latinos.
In 2018 the country as a whole went for the democrats by 8.6%, in 2022 the country as whole will probably go for republicans by 2-3%. That’s a 10-11 point shift in the National environment. Not saying the shift among Latinos isn’t important but it’s very misleading to compare the 2018 election results to the 2022 election results.
Because the democrats rely on high margins in several key constituencies including latino voters that does matter and we shouldn't ignore it.
