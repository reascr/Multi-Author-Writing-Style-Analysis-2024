While still not actually conducting true/primary research (which, I guess would be conducting and publishing a meta study).
But I know their “research” isn’t actually real, reliable, unbiased research, so I shouldn’t expect so much.
That made me sad but immensely frustrated. It proved they didn’t actually “do their own research” at all, because if they had they would’ve at least come across the very basics about vaccines and would have known that that’s NOT how they work.
I do know someone who has been an anti-vaxxer for decades who did start to like trump a lot less after he took credit for the vaccine stuff though, so at least one of them was consistent.
When the vaccines first started rolling out I had a maga fan reply to a comment I made on a thread about it and they were ranting about how “leftists” need to be grateful and worship trump for the vaccine because without him it never would’ve happened. Yet in the next paragraph of the very same comment they went on to talk about government overreach and how vaccines are this and that and they’ll never get it, etc. It was so odd.
AZ is a bit surprising. I was there in 2016 at ASU and a lot of my fraternity brothers were outspoken Trump fans.
