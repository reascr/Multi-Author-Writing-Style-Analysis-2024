Rep. Ruben Gallego announced he will run for Senate in Arizona on Monday, setting up a potential three-way race in the battleground state in 2024 that poses a threat to independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s hold on the seat.
From reporters Liz Goodwin and Marianna Sotomayor: Gallego’s entry could make a three-way race in the battleground state in 2024; it’s unclear currently if Sinema plans to run for reelection.
She’ll get votes from both parties, and it’s definitely no rely an uphill battle for the Gallego, but it’s very possible her percentage of the votes will be in the single digits.
She’s betting that she’ll be able to split the liberal vote and in sure a Republican victory, unless the democrats who hate her support her instead of Gallago.
If the Democrats are nice to her she'll drop out, but if they aren't she'll try to give the seat to the Republicans by staying in the race.
I think Sinema's strategy is now that she no longer hold her deciding vote hostage against the Democrats she's using the Senate seat. "Give me my demands and I won't run". It's basically the only thing she has at this point since she had no chance of keeping the seat as a Dem and still has no chance as an independent.
