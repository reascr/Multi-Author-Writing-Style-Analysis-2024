The variance of acronyms is so interesting. You referenced the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and I found:
The article mentioned that the Taliban took credit for it. So basically we have a religion killing people in the same religion for being the wrong flavor of the religion.
So it's one subsect of a religion not being the right flavor as the same subsect of the same religion.
It's not only that they are the same religion (after all Sunnis and Shiites both follow Islam and they've been killing each other regularly for over a thousand years), but in this case both the Pakistani Taliban and the victims are Sunni Muslim.
I am all up for appeasing Islam by saying all religions are the same but IMHO and with current statistics, Islam has been quite destructive when it comes to killing, raping, enslaving people coz of a holy book. That too in this century.
Merely stating some stories from the history of India doesn't do any justice to your earlier delusional argument of 'hindus commited as many atrocities as muslims' . Nor does it support this baseless claim. All it does is it tells me that you are just looking to win an argument.
I didn't move goal posts. I was just letting you know that there are quite a number of examples to go by when it comes to atrocities by Islamic terrorists.
Isis, different train bombings, al Qaeda. Every country across Africa, Asia, Europe has its own painful story to share. Can't be shared here coz there is so many. And that too happening every day.
