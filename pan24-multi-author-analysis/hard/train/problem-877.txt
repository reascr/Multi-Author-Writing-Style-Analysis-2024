It's an interesting thought that would require some dives into the various possibilities. That would basically be a game theory problem, the only issue is the study of game theory assumes rational agents. I think we can all agree we can't assume that here.
As of right now, I doubt this will happen. What Democrats need to pull this off today are Republicans at the end of their career, willing to sacrifice it all for a cushy commitee position, and a few provisions in other bills.
Sort of. Although there are possibilities to win without a majority of those elected, just a majority of those voting, I don't think Democratics will do that. Either a true majority (By backing Jefferies, or a comprise coalition candidate), or no move at all.
To actually come out on top, Democratics would need solid support by giving concessions to anyone deciding to cross the aisle, locking down enough votes for not just now, but the key House items like the budget.
Becoming speaker, without the guarantees of a true majority, will ruin Democratic's position. They'll be diving head first into what was before a Republican vs Republican problem, with no easy way out.
