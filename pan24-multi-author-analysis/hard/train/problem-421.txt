Well, that's title gore really. A railway is railway, "secret" are probably just branches that go to Putin's residences. And they're not really secret, the secret lies in that everyone working on railroad knows that it's forbidden to use those forks for anything or drive there (but it's not like train drivers have any free will about where they go, anyway).
With actual Russian labor and material costs, Putin could have built railway track to take several turns around the earth during his term, using only the % of the budget he throws at war right now.
Probably not, but then again, Russia is THE biggest country in the world, with incredibly low population density. There's hundreds and hundreds of miles of tracks that don't really go through any settlements. And as paranoid Putin is, he'll surely prefer those.
Well, knowing Putin... His armored train is probably one of the best built things in Russia. It could probably withstand everything below a Tomahawk missile. So it makes sense for him because, unless Russia goes to war with the West or his military starts a coup, he'll be completely safe in his train. Revolting citizens won't really be able to do much except derail the thing. But if he's protected by a few inches of steel... He just has to wait for the military to come save his ass while watching his citizens take pot shots at him from the bullet proof windows.
