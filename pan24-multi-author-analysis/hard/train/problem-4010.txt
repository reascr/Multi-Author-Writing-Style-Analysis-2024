I think a better analogy is, fill a barrel up 1/3 with rats. After they start to get hungry they will want to get out to find food. They'd have to cooperate with one another to stand on one another to get some, but not all of them, out of the barrel. But they won't, and they'll eat each other instead.
Do they even know what a "civil war" is? How exactly is this war going to be fought. With tweets? Who determines the winner?
Why is "civil war" now the answer to everything? Between blue and red voters, and states, and now within the GOP.
You should really take a look at how close some of those wins/losses were statewide. Fascism is not hurting them nearly as much as you think, in fact if there wasn't dissent from "RINO" within the party at the state level they might have won more. Arizona had a pretty obvious choice to make and it came incredibly close. Nevada still voted in a governor who is an election denier. I can definitely see how they think doubling down will ensure their victory, and TBH I'm not sure it won't.
