I am reminded of South Korea’s development of their steel industry, and Britain’s preconditions for promoting “free trade” after establishing a dominant industrial capacity.
That said, poverty is the biggest killer in Indonesia. Fix that, and solutions to secondary problems will evolve, just like the electrostatic precipitators that had to be installed to reduce fly ash pollution at that plant in Alberta….
Having been in Beijing in heating season, I understand. Everything smelled like coal, and the haze was just disgusting. I grew up next to 2 GW of coal fired electricity generation in Alberta, and NEVER smelled anything like this.
Canadian here. Quebec has abundant cheap hydro used for green aluminum smelters. Indonesia might be using coal for theirs, but that will evolve. What’s most important is to lift the remaining 50% of the Indonesian population out of poverty.
This is a temporary thing. I state this having watched the USA regularly institute punitive duties on Canadian softwood lumber, and regularly having those protectionist duties struck down as illegal and unfair. Indonesia’s is another case of “better to apologize than to ask for permission”.
History indicates that countries must protect their domestic industries to develop world class competitors. Good on Indonesia.
Ever been to Jakarta? When I was in my 20s I cruised around on a small bike, and after even short trips you could take a tissues and rub black soot off your face. Indonesia is still dependent on coal and other fossil fuels, so they can do it, but it won't be helping the environment or anyone's health.
