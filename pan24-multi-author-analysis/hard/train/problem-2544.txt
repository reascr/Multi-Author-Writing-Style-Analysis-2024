Depends. It would likely mean that China would do to those smaller countries what Russia has been trying to do to the former USSR countries - take stewardship and eventually obliterate their cultures and replace with the occupier's.
I could see alot of eastern Russia falling under China's influence, and western Russia bending to the EU to some degree. Maybe Belarus will expand some.
A dozen? No. But I could see several splintered factions. Maybe east and west Russia. I call dibs on naming the southern Caucasus region, "Caucasia.".
See. I kinda disagree. First of all, I didn't say it can't work, I said it is destined to go bad. That's a difference.
America basically has the civil war codified by lawusing a two party the winner takes all system with the office of president collecting more and more authority over the years, things that were in the hand of congress before.
Second, your historical example seems to claim that the two party system is actually good and could even prevents a civil war, but I don't see that line of argument. You say it yourself, no one held a majority and that is where conflict arised. But having close to no majority in a two party system so that every election becomes a coin toss and important reforms can't be archived with the necessary majority, you come to standstill, the same standstill mimicking that historical situation, and in recent years you can see that conflict already.
