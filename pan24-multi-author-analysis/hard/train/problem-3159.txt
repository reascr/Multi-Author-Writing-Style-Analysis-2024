So if putin fires a handful of missiles at the US there will be hundreds of missiles fired in defense, virtually ensuring the inbound missiles are destroyed.
He means that one missile into Russia will supposedly lead to a response of hundreds of warheads. And yes, one missile can carry several nuclear warheads. It’s unclear whether he means a nuclear missile entering Russia or any missile, but I think it’s all bluffing anyway.
We've updated because we have no intention of firing a nuke or missile into Russia, but Russia has been threatening it.
The US stance is if Russia goes nuclear, then we go nuclear. We've recently updated our terms of engagement to include lesser forms of nukes. Such as tactical nukes or smaller size nukes to take out small areas. It may also include Russia using a nuclear power plant meltdown for their benefit.
Neither side will lose their mind over a single non nuclear missile hitting their home countries. They will respond in kind, meaning one missile for one missile, whether it's intentional or not.
