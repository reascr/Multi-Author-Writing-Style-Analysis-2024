Yep, at this point you can make damn near anything a credible threat as long as it has a 120mm+ gun and you can figure out how to cram a modern stabilizer/fcs/optics into it. Aside from slapping ERA onto it, though, there's not a ton you can do to increase survivability though... That's the point where things like the Challenger 2 or the Abrams shine...
All of the crispy fresh western tanks are in addition to that constant drip feed of upgraded Soviet armor.
TL;DR western tanks are more or less better at every level than Russian, better maintained, and were designed with more intelligent, modern military doctrine. IE modern western combined arms. Ukraine's army is modernizing like a true Western army, but has been stuck using Russian tools designed for Russian tactics. These tanks change that.
It's not just about the tanks. It's about the IFV's, AFV's, fire support vehicles, missile defense and artillery too.
This is really important, because those vehicles have been designed to work together in a combined arms force. They all use the same ammunition, the same command and control practices, and all that other stuff. Countries haven't been sending stuff willy nilly. It's been sent because the West has been trying to build one of these ABCT's.
