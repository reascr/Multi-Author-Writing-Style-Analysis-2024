I understand training has been authorised and may even have started but why would anyone be agreeing to send tanks until Ukraine can actually use them?
I assume a small number of nato units would join ukraine war as independents or mercenaries which means not everyone on tank team is new to German tank tech.
Without the USA sending Abrams European countries need to be willing to send significant parts of their tank force to supply Ukraine with the amount of tanks they need. Likely up to an level that at least some of their own tank units have to be disbanded since they will lack the tanks to remain operational. If not even the UK, a nuclear armed island country (so ground forces are secondary for their own defense) with one of the strongest militaries in NATO is willing to do so how can one expect that from mainland European nations some of them bordering Russia?
That was what I wanted to point out. Without the USA sending Abrams, 300 modern western MBT for Ukraine might just be an unrealistic goal.
Someone did, though no one knows which country it is yet, and I doubt weâ€™ll find out until the tanks are already in Ukraine. (Provided Germany actually gives permission).
