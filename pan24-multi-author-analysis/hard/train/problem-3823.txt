At my old house I started flying a rainbow American flag on my flagpole. I was sick of seeing all the neighbors and family flying thin blue line flags or American flags corrupted with slogans or Trumps face. I even had my brother say something to me about the flag and my only response was it is better than his tastless American Flag with “Fuck Biden” printed on it.
Read about the flag code in the U.S. So many people are so stupid and oblivious to this. It's a joke how the American flag is used these days.
The pride flag does not oppose the american flag. In fact, Gay Pride is one of the most american things I can possibly think of. When I think of freedom of expression, the pursuit of happiness, and escaping persecution (which is what the founding fathers broke away from the UK to do, even though they still owned slaves), I can think of no other group that's trying to obtain those three things than LGBTQ+ people.
Bottom line, this kind of stuff is the most anti-american thing I can possibly think of, and if you support it, you need to take a serious look at yourself and your values. Especially if you think you value freedom of speech and expression while supporting bullshit like this.
And you will never hear the end of it if you try take away our freedom of speech right to fly a swastika'.
You think trying to stifle freedom of expression is american? You're wrong. You think banning books and flags is okay? You're both wrong and unamerican. You think LGBT people abuse kids more than religion does? You're dead wrong. You think sexual education hurts kids?
