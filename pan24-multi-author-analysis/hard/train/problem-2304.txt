He should run again. He’s been the most productive and efficient president in mine and many other Americans’ lifetimes.
I’m not too concerned about age because he has the best healthcare in the world and if he’s in good health (which he seems to be), then he should continue doing this country a service.
Let us have 4 more years of a damn good politician and progress and we’ll talk in 2028 about a younger, Democrat president.
I would like a younger president with more modern views who hasn’t been corrupted by decades in politics.
I get sick of their “it’s so-so’s turn now” that they seem to play. But the democrats have had 4 years and the best they can do is biden.
the democrats as a party pretty much exist to make excuses for joe biden at this point. imagine how much more they’d accomplish by putting that energy into actually trying to govern in normal peoples’ best interest.
a "nebulous concept" of not supporting the current president is all it takes for enough people to not give a shit about voting for him in the coming election.
