Munger received that “gift” numerous times throughout his life. He dropped out of college to fight in world war 2 and struggled financially through most of his early life, which included the Great Depression.
His early adult hood was spent in world war 2 and then got completely taken in his second marriage. My grandma was born in 22 and led a fairly upper middle class life for the time, she had quite a few stories of going without. I think he’s just referencing that time to now, and he’s a 98 year old man so I tend to give them a break.
The poor int he depression did have it significantly worse and I think that’s where he’s drawing the parallel. Granted it is a dumb thing to say with so much wealth, he could change millions of peoples lives if he chose to.
Imagine how much better off they'd be if wealth inequality wasn't as disgustingly lopsided as it is.
Median income doesn't mean anything when we have a lot of the world's richest people inside our borders throwing those stats off.
Seriously in relative terms to the growth of the worlds output the wealth inequality speaks for itself. We should be 10 times better off and we shouldn't just be happy with what Mr. Billionaire says as if we should appeal to authority for his interest.
