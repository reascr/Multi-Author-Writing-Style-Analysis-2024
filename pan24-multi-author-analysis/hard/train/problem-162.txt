Not for the purposes of tax exception. All entities need to advocate for the policies that they find advantageous, be it persons, businesses, unions, religions, or even private social clubs. They are all subject to the laws of the land & so should be allowed to influence policies so that they benefit them.
The difference is that a candidate or a political party are more than just 1 law or position. For example, one can support the GQP b/c you think they are pro-life/birth but have to deal with their economic policies. Contrast this with voting for a single ordinance or writing a letter to an elected official to pass a set of anti-abortion laws.
I know that my fellow Mormons belong to the Christofascist, but the problem is our religion does not. Most "Christians" don't consider us Christians, even though the actual name of our church has always been The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints(emphasis mine, kinda). Oh, and the Book of Mormon even declares that we teach & prophesy of Christ(). So yeah, those of us that are paying attention realize how dangerous these ass holes are & refuse all association with them. It actually pisses me off when I hear a fellow Mormon spout their bull shit.
Hell, it’s harmful to other Christians. Anyone not part of their narrow Doomsday Club is in trouble. I’m sure being a Progressive Christian is basically admitting your love for the Antichrist to these people.
There are a lot of “Christian” democrats and if there’s one thing that unites all the faiths it’s any perceived persecution of their brethren. The separation of church and state is a fraud—“in god we trust” is on our money. How free can politics be considered to operate without undue religious influence when those same bribed politicians are themselves religious and paid with notes that explicitly state allegiance to “faith?”.
I have no problems with churches endorsing political candidates as long as they file taxes and get no non-profit organization benefits.
