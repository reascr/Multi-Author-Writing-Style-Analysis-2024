Russian and Western planes are built very differently. As an example, altitude is shown in feet in Western planes, while as Russian ones use meters. Therefore for Ukrainian pilots to transfer over to F-16s, it would be a very large and wide reaching change. In the immediate term, they're better served by getting more of the kinds of planes they're used to. And there are NATO members who have old Russian planes available, so a solution exists.
As to whether or not the Russians know whether a given F-16 has all the capabilities of the US market aircraft: believe me, they know. But it doesn’t matter, because it’s not the “fully loaded” capabilities that the Russians are worried about, just the basic air superiority and ground attack capabilities that these aircraft afford.
Regardless, I think this position has more to do with the difficulty of long-term logistics support than aircraft capability. While it is possible (and not uncommon) for F-16 units to deploy far from their home bases, long-term support is expensive and complex, and requires a ton of training for maintenance and support engineers.
Your first stament is simply incorrect as it concerns advanced fighter aircraft. There is not a single F-16 variant used anywhere in the world that has the full capabilities of their American counterparts. The same holds for any other advanced fighter platform, including the F-35. This includes nuclear carry capability.
Any aircraft sold by the US to foreign governments can be "dumbed down" in capability and many are. That certainly includes the nuclear carry capability.
