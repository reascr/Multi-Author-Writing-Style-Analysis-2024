Yeah I'm aware of that. Just because it's a possible side effect doesn't mean 100% have a peoblem. Hell, there are developing youth having problems gaining bone mass that aren't going through a transition of any kind. And that's a worry too. Thank god there's people who help them along. I hope they all get what they need for stability because that's super hard to come by.
I'm short too in fact and probably more people have had their height stunted during development from stress over Rx's of any kind. And what does height matter when your bones are so weak you're in a wheelchair at 30? That's where bone density and growth can be an issue. Is it happening to everybody in the trans-youth category? Obviously not or we would hear an awful lot about it.
That actually goes hand in hand with it. I would love it if people were to be better informed so they don't express incorrect, violent ignorance. Intolerance of a person struggling with themselves is itself, intolerable.
Just because it's a known side effect does not mean everybody experiences it during the process. Which unfortunately, is what a lot of more conservative voices would have others believe. Or other garbage like, 6 year olds are getting their genitalia removed which is not happening.
I never said it was easy, only that it was possible for minors to get gender-affirming surgery. The surgery I was thinking of was removing breast tissue.
Aside from removing breast tissue, what other surgeries are done before 19? Also, it’s not “easy” to get these surgeries done. You need to guve letters from several doctors that can attest you’re trans and you’ve been living as your desired gender for a year.
