Many landlords are only renting short term to resell for a profit when market changes. Some might be feeling bite of interest rates. Some been complaining they can’t afford to do this short term thing anymore due to costs.
Either way these short term landlords playing a type of stock market sales but with houses are the worse. No fault evictions for their tenants who they barely make repairs for. Also they try to do work on homes for less. Which takes money away from businesses who do fittings or supplies for houses (as long term owners of homes put more money into home improvement).
The more houses these.investors buy up, the less supply that is available to others to buy, so more people have to rent for longer.
Yep, they buy up a ton of them to park their cash and then coincidentally gain a decent amount of control over the rental market.
Actual Real Estate investments do turn a lot of profit if you're capitalized to take advantage of them.
Real estate gains are sky-high and coveted because of the massive leverage inherent in the business and a suite of government programs/tax advantages to support your investments, and that’s not really reflected in REITs.
