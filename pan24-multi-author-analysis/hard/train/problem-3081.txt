It's really hard to make such a determination. A bill gets passed but who did the work to get it passed. A small bill like this is almost no work, likely just think it up write it put it forth. Small distraction at best.
Something big like say the CHIPS act is a lot of backroom dealing and negotiation. Finding out which senators are opposed, who can be swayed, and what they want. Then of course you have the people who are against a bill working to sway people to their side. There's really no way you can every quantify who is doing what since most of this happens behind closed doors or on a private phone call. So we only know what happened when a congressperson talks about it publicly or an aide says something.
It would be difficult because not every congressman is the same. It'd be like giving everyone in the company from the CEO to the janitor the same grading system. Not to mention not every bill is the same, some take a decade to finalize and find support, and naming a post office is done in 2 hours and passed by unanimous vote.
My theory is sunken cost syndrome. They were told as children and have consequently spent their entire lives building up a "masculine profile". So someone deeming that trait as worthless would make a life's work meaningless.
