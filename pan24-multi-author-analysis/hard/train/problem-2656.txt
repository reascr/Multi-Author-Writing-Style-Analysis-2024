They are an American company and allowing threats on your platform (corporate company-owned social media is NOT protected by Free Speech laws) to share threats against the president of the USA opens up legal problems. I have been on a forum that had such rules even though the the owner was not at all US-friendly.
In fact, it is alwas up to the moderation team's call what to do with a given problematic post or not.
Also, you are falling into the mistake where you think social media companies have any obligation towards freedom of speech. They do not. They are corporations and can apply whatever arbitrary rules they deem necessary. Each social media company like Twitter (both before and after Musk) has its own rules that it can arbitrarily chose.
Why should they? It's their platform. It's their money that makes the websites and platform work. They are held responsible for what is on it, even if nobody made such a decision within the company. So why shouldn't they decide how the rules are applied?
But also "no" as in "you can't violate law". Offending a foreign head of state, e.g., is a crime in large parts of the world. Wishing him death is just a plain no.
