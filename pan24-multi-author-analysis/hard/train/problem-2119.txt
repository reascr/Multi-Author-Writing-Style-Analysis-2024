You're really ignoring that each item you mentioned was killed by right wing obstruction. Every time. Kirsten Sinema and Joe manchin are both right wing, btw.
Republican voters will never support m4a on a ballot, and it would likely require congressional action anyway. With the broken Senate consisting of wildly slanted representation toward rural right wing states, it cannot happen.
Republicans who claim they are going to compromise get voted out of office or suddenly find some reason to vote against anything Democrats propose, even if it means many of their own constituents lose out.
Republicans want compromise but Desantis and/or Trump are still the most popular figures in the party?
How do you compromise with republicans? What is the middle ground on homophobia and transphobia? They only get rights 3 days a week and alternating weekends?
People complain about the government being out of touch with people. This shows people are just as out of touch with what is going on in the government.
