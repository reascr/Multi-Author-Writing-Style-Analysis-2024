When for 15 year your idea of war is to shake your weapon, shoot a couple of rounds in the air and everyone does what you want. Of course what's happening in Ukraine is hard.
No no Ahole, Russia is directly involved in Ukraine. When Russia leaves so will the Nato weapons As usual Hound Dog face has it upside down and backwards.
If NATO was involved, Russia already lost the war as we see with just a few NATO arms Ukraine turn the tide just imagine if it was all NATO with all the weapons Russia would be annihilated.
Without wasting time as a Western guy telling other Western people how big NATO is, I am amazed that some people don't even realize what actual NATO all-out attack on Russia would look like, nuclear weapons excluded.
Russia simply doesn't have the anti air capabilities to deal with whatever NATO could throw on them in only the first few days, let alone the consequences of their borders being all over Europe and what cutting Russia out of many international markets would do to them for real.
It's not even about a superiority of power, it's a single nation against the biggest alliance there is, remnant of the previous largest worldwide alliance there ever was.
