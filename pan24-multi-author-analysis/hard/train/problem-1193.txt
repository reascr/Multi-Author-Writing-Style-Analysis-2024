>Voters overwhelmingly supported women’s reproductive freedom on Tuesday, both electing pro-abortion-rights lawmakers and voting in favor of abortion rights—even in red and purple states—on ballot initiatives. “When voters have a chance to decide on this issue, they choose to protect their rights,” one activist said.
Young adults n America are not voting for wedge issues, they are voting as if their lives depended on it. For all the fear mongering that comes from the right about “deadly caravans”and rainbows in classrooms being the work of the devil the younger progressive voters do not need this faux motivation as boomers do, they have the real threats of climate change and fascism to deal with.
GOP are more desperate than they’ve ever been, because young voters do not need to be goaded into participating in elections, they are voting for their lives.
…the problem is now climate change and abortion rights and the real threat of a fascist US has galvanized voters <30 to actually care about elections. The smoke and mirrors no longer work when a potential burning planet and lack of basic rights if the GOP have their way is enough to cut through to nonsensical “woke is bad” campaigning all the GOP muppets run with.
