By picking progressive leadership in the House and not Hakeem Jeffries, and giving progressive activists an actual seat at the Democratic Party table.
Progressives need to start acting like the rising future leaders of America if they're ever to be accepted by the broader voting public or by the Democratic Party as such. No one should expect another political faction to just hand them their reigns.
No, we don't need progressives to be handed anything. They need to take their place else they have little prospect of keeping it.
The way forward is doing good for America and the party. Win elections, help constituents, be good at governing, be an asset to the shiftable Democrats and form positive alliances that marginalize the non shiftable through quiet irrelevance, not through rancor and in-fighting.
I think the midterms proved that Progressive policies are popular enough to overwhelm most Republican attempts at election fuckery. It also energizes a growing youth vote that is overwhelmingly Left-leaning. Biden and the Dems at large will do well to remember this in the years ahead.
