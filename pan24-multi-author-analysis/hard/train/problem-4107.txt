Russian logistics are holding (mostly, the lack of quality steel is really hurting them) at the strategic level, but they're struggling at the tactical level.
We can't do much about Russia's ability to railroad in supplies from all over their country, even the far reaches in the east, but it's becoming increasingly hard for Russia to move shells from the unloading points to the front line. It's one of several reasons Russia's artillery usage has fallen off heavily.
I don't know if it was by design or not, but NATO slow-walking artillery in stages to the Ukrainians has been devastating to Russian supplies. Every time we roll out a new artillery system that increases the range of Ukrainian fire missions, Russia loses a whole mess of ammo and supply depots and is forced to push them even further back.
Once that is over, Ukrainian units will have the training and logistical support for the new toys and then launch their own offence, taking advantage of losses Russia suffered from any pyrrhic victories they might have had earlier.
Despite what people previously believed, Russia is not leagues ahead of Ukraine, so Ukraine is perfectly capable of stopping it be a war in the sky.
Ukraine is certainly in the “right” in this conflict, but they share the same Soviet mentality that we so decry the Russians for. They are trying to present an image of themselves to us that we will recognize and want to support, which is understandable in their situation, but we need to understand the different between reality and the image they want to portray on the media.
