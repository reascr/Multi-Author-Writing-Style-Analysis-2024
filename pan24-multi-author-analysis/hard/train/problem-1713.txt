Notice the conservative emphasis ("due process" and especially "unprecedented") so rarely heard from Republicans but slowly getting more common. It just goes to show that the nutcases are having a hard time purging conservatives from the Republican party.
Nancy Mace (who certified 2020 voters' decision on Jan 6) beat Katie Arrinon (who supported Trump) in the 2022 primary.
Democrats are pretty strained by the responsibility of being both the liberal party and the conservative party, and you know a lot of conservative voters are holding their noses when they have to vote Democrat. Left/right is a legitimate difference of opinion between people, and one party can't really have a coherent platform trying to serve both. There will always be incentive for conservative politicians to run as Republicans instead of Democrats, and when they do, sometimes they're going to win their primaries against the nutcases, _especially_ magans.
Considering how well Dems did on the mid terms with Governor and state legislature races, enstating Moore would no longer benefit Republicans like they hoped. It would states like PA that picked up a Dem majority and Dem governor could be forever Democrat since stayed could just over rule any future votes.
