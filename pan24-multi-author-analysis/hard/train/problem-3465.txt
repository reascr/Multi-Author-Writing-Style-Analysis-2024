Politicians are just weapons to some to be used against people they don't like. I honestly think they don't really consider the choice is going to effect them at all, but they know it will piss off people they don't like.
Luckily, the majority of people don't like that kind of fuckery, and are now voting against it. He exposed the political rot of the GOP and Conservatives, and we might now be seeing the first formations of the disgusting fungus that's rotting out the core of the country.
I'm starting to think that Trump actually kept a promise for once in his life - by draining the swamp. He fucked up the GOP so badly they may never recover, and he exposed all the shitheads who existed so we all know how shitty they are. He made it okay to be a hateful prick in public, and now we know who all the hateful pricks are.
Even if you hate everything he’s done, he did it. He said what he was gonna do in office and he’s done it all while winning a proxy war without US troops being in danger. I have no idea why republicans they call him ‘sleepy’.
