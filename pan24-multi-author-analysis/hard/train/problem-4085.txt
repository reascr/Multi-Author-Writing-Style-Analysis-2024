In the law it’s said there’s no right without a remedy. If the State courts can issue a ruling, but the legislature can ignore it without consequence, then the state court has no power. Elsewhere I read some of the judges suggested the state court ruling could be appealed to a federal court. I’d prefer that as a compromise.
Is that a better compromise, cause everyone here is trying to find the worst of every situation here.
>Under this approach, a state court could block an election map, but then only send it back to the legislature to try again rather than impose changes itself.
Unfortunately a huge amount of our election laws depend on public officials doing the job they’re sworn to do, and there’s a huge blind spot in the law if they just … don’t. (See also: Arizona).
Yes State courts have the authority to review congressional maps. No state courts do not have the authority to draw congressional maps. The constitutionality seems pretty straightforward to me.
Nah. State courts very clearly have the authority to rule on election maps and very clearly have no authority to draw their own maps. A ruling that reflects that reality is more than fair.
A narrow ruling might be a desirable outcome. The problem is that it doesn't make any fucking sense. The only way that this is a federal issue rather than a state issue, is if the state courts lack the capacity to decide that a state law governing federal elections violates the state constitution. If state courts can decide that, at all, then this is purely a state issue and the Supreme court has no jurisdiction over this.
