I can't bear watching a 90 minute game when only 2-3 minutes of it actually matter. Like with this game, the goal was like \40 seconds tops. No need to spend an hour and a half watching.
Like I know I sound like an utter caveman here but how do prevented goals matter at all? They had the same effect on the game as someone sitting on the ball for 2-3 minutes.
In football, there’s about 20-40 seconds of downtime between every single play. Some plays only last a few seconds. In soccer there is rare downtime, and when there is they add it back in at the end of the half.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a basketball and football guy myself. But I’m going to counter your argument because I think it is poor.
In basketball, it’s almost expected that every possession will end in a score, this makes every score have less meaning, and makes every possession more boring.
Basketball is boring because its just back and forth scoring points, feels like scoring a basket doesn't even matter because it happens nonstop.
