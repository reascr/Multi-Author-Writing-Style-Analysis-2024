He's a perfect fit for the GOP - he's a giant distraction for the media, so while everyone is busy talking about the latest George Santos bullshit, McCarthy and the rest of the clowns can do awful shit to the country relatively unnoticed.
He’s got a very narrow window of time to do whatever the fuck he wants with the attention and power he has, and since he doesn’t actually give a shit about governance, he’s happy to take direction while exploiting that little window of opportunity to the fullest extent possible.
He’s not getting a second term. He HAS TO know that. But there’s nothing he can do right now that would make his long term prospects worse.
And the only people that can remove him are his Republican colleagues. And they have a narrow enough margin that, so long as he does what he’s told like he just did re: committees, there is also nothing he can do that would make putting up with him worse than putting his seat back up for a special election that would probably go to a Democrat.
It almost feels like he made a bet with somebody that he can get himself elected & then kicked out of Congress within six months and now he's getting desperate he's going to lose.
