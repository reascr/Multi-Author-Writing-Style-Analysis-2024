The key is that the documented fact that military spending does not vanish money does not mean that it's the best investment. Better investments have greater returns for the economy.
If the government started actually looking for ways to maximize ROI for the entire economy then health care, the railways, and nuclear power infrastructure would be nationalized and invested in en-mass. Those industries all have tremendous untapped ROI and are all proven areas where government management works because top-down management is efficient (natural monopolies) but where abusive monopolization is dangerous to consumers. Nationalization is also proven to work in all cases.
But that would require taxing the rich to benefit society, not taxing the poor to benefit the rich, and that's a cardinal sin for Republicans.
The GOP's fetish for treating public services as profit centers is just code language for, "We hate all government services and expenditures unless they're for the exclusive benefit of the wealthy elite.".
