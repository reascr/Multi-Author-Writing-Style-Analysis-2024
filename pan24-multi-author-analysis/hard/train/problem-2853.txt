> Many of the early leaders of Christian Nationalist, anti-integration, and other anti-Semitic groups had ties to WW2 era pro-fascist and pro-Nazi organizations.
Literally only people who encourage and defend nazis or who support white supremacist, fascist politicians and policies. Saying they accuse everyone of it to try to trick people into disregarding accurate accusations doesn't work because most people aren't as stupid as the nazis who try it.
Do you pretend to be stupid enough to not know about nazis because you think a third party reading this will be stupid enough to believe you? I assure you, no one is as stupid as people who defend nazis.
The GOP has always had a place at their table for Nazis. They share a history of enforcing a racial hierarchy through the power of the state. Extreme nationalism, disdain for education and journalism, and pathological obsession over the 'preservation' of a fictitious ideal society that never was define both. They're cut from the same ideological cloth. Not every republican is a Nazi but every Nazi is a republican.
Nah, Republicans have been flirting with American Nazis since the 1950s. See: George Lincoln Rockwell, a truly despicable POS. Trump is just the latest dimension of that long-running relationship.
