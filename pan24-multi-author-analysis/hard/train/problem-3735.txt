If you read the article, their Bill of Rights states anyone 16 and over is free from age discrimination.
"The Supreme Court found that the current voting age of 18 was inconsistent with the country's Bill of Rights, which gives people a right to be free from age discrimination when they have reached 16.".
Reminds me of a great episode of The West Wing where a children's right to vote group had an in depth discussion/argument with Toby Zeigler. He was basically convinced, and he suggested they start at the local level and work at lowering it in increments. It has a lot of merit when you're talking about things like high school students being allowed to vote in school board elections.
You're getting downvotes, but as someone who supports the decision to let those 16 year olds vote, I think you're right to an extent.
When 16 year olds can go vote we might finally see changes to the education system for example. In Germany the education system is basically untouched since decades, why would they change it? It doesn’t yield votes, it’s not getting done.
