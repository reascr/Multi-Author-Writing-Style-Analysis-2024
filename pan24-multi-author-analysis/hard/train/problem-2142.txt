It is thanks to our soldiers who are fighting near Svatove, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Vuhledar, Orikhiv that there was no place for a "special military operation" in his annual address.
"I met with @JosepBorrellF to coordinate steps to speed up the production and delivery of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine. We agreed to launch a new format of regular consultations between the EU and Ukraine’s foreign and defense ministries to streamline our joint work.".
But so be it…. on to the next potential Putin speech where he could declare war Launch nukes General mobilization Absorb Belarus Annex parts of Georgia.
A Belarusian attack on Lithuania would mean that Putin would either have to give up on Belarus and pull troops out or risk entering direct conflict between Russian and NATO forces.
The point is that Putin can say anything and his people will listen to it and applaud and the rest of the world will listen too and dissect.
My guess is that secretly a lot of people around Putin wishes there was someone sane in Putin's position, but it doesn't seem like anyone will act on it.
I dearly hope that going forward, people will stop hyping up these fucking ridiculous speeches from Putin….
