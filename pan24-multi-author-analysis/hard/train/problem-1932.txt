They got rid of almost their entire moderation team, and Elon has a non-existent moral compass, so where Jack would step and and demand certain incendiary figures got banned (sometimes rules be damned), Musk is just unbanning everyone and letting the crazies run the nut house.
He did call a random guy a pedophile with no proof once upon a time. It's just back then he was busy running companies people believed in that he bought after they already had a successful plan and good people in place. Now he's running Twitter into the ground and people are shocked to find out he kinda sucks at running companies.
At Twitter, there is no management layer steering the ship, it's just him, and so far he's a disaster. The only way to make his management look competent is to claim he's purposely trying to tank the company. I think the simplest explanation, that he's out of his depth, is the most likely.
Elon Musk is a chode. When he was still fighting to get put of buying Twitter, his main angle of attack was that Twitter was flooded with bots, more than was disclosed.
That is the only way to stand against and combat this bullshit, make Twitter irrelevant like the alt-right Twitter clones. When the rest of us allow the platform to drown in obscurity, their power is non-existent.
Abandon the platform, delete the accounts. Don't click on links that bring you to Twitter. Don't click on links that are articles about Twitter.
