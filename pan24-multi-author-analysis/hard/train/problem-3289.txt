This is what happens when ego is so big they think they can do no wrong. Kanye legit said in a public form, INTO the microphone that he can say anti-semetic things and there's nothing adidas can do about it. The fact he thinks he can say or do anything without consequence Yeah thats an huge ego talking there. He thinks hes the second coming of Jesus.... he is not. He is a moron.
Now I just think they are dumb. Ignorance is fine not everyone knows everything. But being dumb is a choice, you can't stay dumb forever unless you actively block out new information.
Imagine actually looking at this guy and using him as an example of a smart/strong/sane person. It's been 6 years and I literally can't understand how this man has any supporters. I feel like I lost all respect for 38% of the country. I used to think "well they are ignorant, but they aren't necessarily dumb.".
I.e. being into expensive shoes, even if they're ugly or you don't wear them, is really no different than collecting guns, knives, old video game consoles, comic books, etc. It's not inherently less valuable than any other hobby, you're just not the target audience.
I didn't really get it either, until I heard that for people from some social circles/cultures or for people who live in densely populated cities where something like car ownership or home ownership is not realistic or possible, they turn to things like shoes, hats, etc. as ways to express themselves and take pride in something that's valuable to them, and that makes sense to me.
