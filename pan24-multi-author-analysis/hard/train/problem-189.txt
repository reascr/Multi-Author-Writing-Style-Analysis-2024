Sure, but one of the reasons the French subs were taking so long, and costing so much, was because australia was asking France to modify their nuclear design to conventional power.
Now, you might be able to argue the French were correct that Australia wouldn't cut its losses and terminate the contract if the nuclear sub deal wasn't on the cards. However, it's hardly the fault of Australia if it makes the desire to seek alternative options known and another viable option is presented.
Australia had signaled they were exploring alternative sub options in public forums one year piror to the actual cancellation due to contract underperformance. The decision to accept the nuclear subs deal was also supported by both major Australian political parties so it was hardly a captains call.
It's safe to say you don't understand the American defense industry if you are making this comment. The only concerning barrier is how quickly Australia can acquire the trained workforce to operate the nuclear submarines.
At the end of the day, nuclear submarines are much more suited to future warfare and the types of seas surrounding Australia.
Just FYI in case you're not following as close as us Australians are, the submarines are not expected to be in the water for another 40 years. I will be 70+ by then.
