The smarter play is her flipping Republican and getting Mitch to promise no primary in 2024. Warnock getting the 51st screwed that plan.
She know she can't win a Democrat primary, Democrats are winning state wide elections (albeit very very close). The better bet is going Republican, getting that backing of the party and the kudos of delivering the Senate, and get the voters who walked away from the crazy.
Well, she did say she would not caucus with the Republicans, so it seems unlikely she wouldn’t with the Dems because then she would lose her committee seats and power. Even without her, because King and Sanders both caucus with the Dems, it would still be 50-49.
Dems already have 2 independents that caucus with them for the purpose of committees, etc - Bernie Sanders and Angus King. As long as she doesn’t caucus with the Republicans, Dems still get majorities on committees. It was actually 50 R - 48 D last session.
“The aide said that Ms. Sinema would keep her committee positions through Democrats, meaning the party would still hold a one-seat edge on the panels next year, giving them new flexibility over nominations and legislation.”.
She’s pretty dumb so maybe she does it anyway, but there isn’t much advantage to doing that in terms of power to get what she wants (money).
