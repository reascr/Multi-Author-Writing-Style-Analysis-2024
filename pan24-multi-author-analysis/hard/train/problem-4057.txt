RuZZia simply doesn't have that many nationalistic men anymore to waste .. the Soviet Union is gone and most young Russians dislike Putin.
.. he can keep sending prisoners and men from the South and East but he will run out eventually and have to send from St Petersburg and Moscow.
This just in, after sending in the army , mentaly Ill, criminals, and a draft no new men that aren't oligarchs to be found....Russians now sending in the.
I'm not trying to down play Ukrainian's resolve or accomplishments. As someone who grew up with the Soviets being the scary "bad" guys of the west I'm just dumbfounded and how terrible the logistics and tactics and supplies Russian has been using.
At least that's one way to solve Russia's outfitting problem, and they're the only ones inhumane enough to do it.
I firmly believe it's going to get to the point where Russia mobilizes so many bodies that the first and second waves will have no weapons at all, and will be followed up by dudes right behind with weapons, just to exhaust the Ukrainians of will and ammunition.
