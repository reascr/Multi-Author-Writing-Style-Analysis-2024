Same here but actually in colorado. I voted the fuck out of yes. (Also straight blue and for legalizing shrooms; let’s serve as an example of how to do it CO!).
This is going on now too. There isn’t “French fries” daily but the healthy vegetable is tater tots one day, then French fries, then baked potato wedges, then sweet potato fries. Pizza has one serving dairy and 1/2 vegetable (plus 1 vegetable from French fries.
What is worse is kids are forced to take the healthy parts with the junk food so most milk and fruit gets tossed in the trash can.
This is why this free food shit is both a waste of money and tremendously damaging to the health of children unless we make sure it’s only healthy food being supplied.
Give kids free lunches, theres 0 justification for forcing the peanut butter sandwich cause your parents didn't send you money or you forgot or the money got stolen or whatever.
People will use the excuse that they don't and they get a peanut butter or similar sandwich if they don't have the money. Its a joke.
They already have to make enough meals for the kids, just give them the food everyone else is getting.
