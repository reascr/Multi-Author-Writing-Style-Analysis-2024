Have they just not heard of Trump before now or what? It was like I loathe the guy and always have and even I admit it's the whole reason he won in the first place.
It was sixteen degrees out when I got up and I was just glad the wind finally let up, so I'm right there with him. If there's any redeeming quality to a cold winter it's your coziest comfiest clothing and your favorite flannel blanket.
I'm morbidly fascinated by what 2024 is going to bring for the GOP. If this is what they put up during what ought to have been a slam dunk midterm things could go very poorly for them. I think it'll come down to the response to Trump's announcement bid. If the MAGA crowd sticks to their guns Republicans will be in the unenviable position of letting hem run roughshod over them again or risk a third-party run torpedoing their chance of winning much of anything.
Not all the MAGAs are gonna ditch trump, and they're doing damage control now to try to get as many votes from him and back to the republican party as they can. I hope about half of them put trump as a write-in.
