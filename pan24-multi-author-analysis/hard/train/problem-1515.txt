It fucking blows my mind that no country is immune to that bannon/trump/facebook/idiot style of shitty .jpg's and "every fallacy in the book"-'arguments'.
I have a 1year old doggo and talk with a lot of people when walking it. Lo and behold I actually found a climate-deniar who instantly started spewing shit I recognized both from 4chan-meme's and other shit. What used to be literal jokes about how mentally handicapped some of the deniers were, only to actually be weaponized and adopted by the idiots who couldn't tell satire from truth.
They've also ramped up disinformation. 2022 was the worst year in modern Swedish history in terms of misinformation being circulated that originated from russia and the ilk.
It's mental that the far right in Sweden regurgitating Russian propaganda is blaming the fact that they do so on the American left.
That this came from the US, the implication that the right wing part of the "cultural war" is a reaction to the left, and that things can only get worse.
This is what happens when we import American political issues, we get the same propaganda regurgitated, both the left and right are doing it. Its just gonna get worse my friend.
