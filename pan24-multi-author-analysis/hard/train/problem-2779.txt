Successfully! with scramjets, accurate targeting, threat avoidance and high-mach maneuvering. Unlike the russian "hypersonic weapon" used in Ukraine, which was pretty much like any other missile, and of little consequence.
Was funny that this attempt failed as have all attempts by russia to produce supposedly advanced weapons, there armata tank is vapourware, they have to buy drones from Iran and ballistic missiles it sounds like.
Putin has been reporting he has hypersonic missiles since trump sold him Americas secrets about the nuclear tipped hypersonic weapons .
He got a jet to fly at hypersonic speeds the shoot a missile thenc alled it russia's response to the US.
During the Cold War one of the few areas that the Soviet Union was consistently more advanced in was rocketry. It makes sense that they would be able to develop the Zircon and it actually performing to their claims, especially since hypersonic weapons were stuff they’ve been developing since the 80s. What actually matters though is how many of them they can field, which is unlikely to be many. Considering their Zircon only entered service just before the invasion, I wouldn’t be surprised if they literally only have single digit numbers of them.
