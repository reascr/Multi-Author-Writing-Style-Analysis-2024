My 13.5 year old puppers just gave into her battle with cancer in December. Spend all the time with her you can. My best photos and memories were in our last two years. I knew she was slowing down so I’d spend an extra 15 mins on the patio with her, or let her get that extra sniff in of that bush; give her extra snacks or pull her a little closer at night. We don’t deserve their complete love. Read the poem “The Power of the dog” by Kipling. If it brings you to a tear, you’re probably doing the right things.
I think you're both on point here. In your case, the people were already on the cruise and showed strong moral fiber by thinking about the victims before their own enjoyment. In the comment you're replying to, it's the situations where the first takeaway is a "cheap vacation" and those harmed by the tragedy are a complete afterthought.
It is really lovely to hear that the passengers were so concerned though. The cruise was already charted, yet they still showed enough resistance about docking there that the captain had to make it clear this would benefit the Haitians for people to get on (off?) board.
