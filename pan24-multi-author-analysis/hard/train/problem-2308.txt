This is a 17 year old boy, he went to hospital after a hard car crash and was about to die, he was still alive and TERRORISTS entered a hospital and took him and disconnected him from all the machines that were keeping him alive....
A 17 year boy Israeli agent in hospital on the brink of death after a car crash? justifications of these actions are so silly, this is in no way self defense or anything like that, all of you should be ashamed of yourselves, taking hurt and almost dead boy from hospitals and killing them is the ugliest and the most unhumane thing I've heard of, wild animals have more mercy on people more than them.
"apparently they thought he was an undercover Israeli agent and that his body could be ransomed for Palestinians being held by Israel or for the bodies of Palestinians held in Israel".
For anyone wondering why: apparently they thought he was an undercover Israeli agent and that his body could be ransomed for Palestinians being held by Israel or for the bodies of Palestinians held in Israel.
