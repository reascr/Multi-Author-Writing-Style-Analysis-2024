I remember when chinaâ€™s current dictator came to power a decade ago and how he had some insane anti corruption purge that resulted in something around 1500+ members being ousted. Obviously it was also a way to rid him of political rivals and adversaries and consolidate power but yeah, these types of things are always super common.
Also to note, Ukraine was also always a country that had a STRONG corruption stereotype lol prior to the war, not many people knew much about Ukraine but the things people did always associate with it are corruption, lots of it. I think either Poland or another neighboring country had Ukrainians make up the most of its jailed prisoners, many due to corruption to an extent within business meddling or something lol.
However, the thing about societies that have had endemic corruption for generations like Ukraine is that everyone with even a modicum of influence or power is also corrupt, including those doing the corruption hunting. That's why it's so difficult to root out.
It is difficult, but possible. I think Zelensky, used the Servant of the people show to offer a mirror and a vision of future to the Ukrainians. That is an important first step. The Maidan protests, and the fact that he was elected based on this vision is an evidence that there's a buy in from the Ukrainian people. The war could be an important catalyst that will speed up the process, but assistance and help from the west will be essential. We must not betray their trust in us and our system of government and rule of law.
I come from that part of the world and it was eerily reminiscent of my country's transition to democracy. Other than the fear of Russian invasion. ( I guess we finally kicked them out in 1990 or 91 so we did have that practical experience in the past).
