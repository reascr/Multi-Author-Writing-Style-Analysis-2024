So by means go ahead and then explain to your citizens why your country's GDP has magically shrunken by 50% overnight because these are the repercussions you are facing.
Orbanland is currently on collision course with EU. Since current polls are showing that Polish government will change this year to one that aligns with EU more and that means end of shielding each other from european sanctions (and even now it's likely it wouldn't be veto'ed as being seen together with Orban who is pro-Russia is going tu cut into your popularity in the polls).
Well, even if Poland flips out of the Orban orbit in the next election, I'm curious if more conservative Italy or Sweden (barring any Hungarian NATO vetos, that is) will start protecting Hungary from the EU like Poland was.
That makes sense to me, but I could see the argument that they can both support Ukraine against Russia and support Hungary against the EU.
Italy's current government might be quite conservative but they have also been very clear in their support of Ukraine against Russia aggression. That's why I don't see them wanting to get any closer to Orb√°n.
