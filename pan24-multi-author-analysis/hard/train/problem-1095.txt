When death is the punishment for peaceful actions, you're gonna get violence from the protesters and their supporters instead. What's the point of peacefully protesting when it has the same punishment as violent riots to overthrow a government.
Now that protesting is punishable by death sentence, protesting is now a fight to the death - thats as escalated as it gets.
If only protesting peacefully means you get the death sentence, at that point you might be inspired to escalate as it doesn't matter. Its how all fascist nations develop partisans and resistance movements.
We're talking about the Iranian people rising up as the government is not giving them any other choice. This isn't about war.
The Iranian government could make some small reforms and maybe keep things chill and placate their population. But instead they're greatly escalating it from a peaceful protest situation to a mass execution of citizens situation.
Once they start imprisoning or executing the family of protesters fir "enabling" them, the number of protesters will drop quick.
