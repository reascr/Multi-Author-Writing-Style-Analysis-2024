Frankly, they should keep it legal, and just apply double/triple the excise taxes they do for cannabis.
I feel like the cases of abortion being criminalized have been as a result of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision (which was not achieved by a majority vote of the citizens of any state), and subsequent state legislatures passing bills to restrict the ability of doctors to perform abortions (which to my knowledge have not been as the result of achieving a majority vote of the citizens of any state where it has occurred, only the votes of several dozen mostly white male legislators).
Post-Dobbs abortion restrictions are tyranny, by virtue of them being demonstrably unpopular (as most americans support the right to access), and still being enforced despite the demonstrable will of the majority. That be some tyranny.
Popular vote can be tyranny on either side. For smokers the flavor ban is extremely unpopular and just makes their enjoyment worse while not impacting consumption.
At least, based on the fact that they recently banned flavored tobacco products outright, by a majority vote.
Well 1st off, How is it a nanny state if people have already been voting against tobacco (they recently voted for a ban on certain flavored products). The voters dont mind screwing usage of tobacco. Voters have an appetite to go against tobacco usage and legaslators are responding and debating.
News flash: many californians dont want to breathe tobacco, hence they will be sympathetic to those that take an extreme stance to banning tobacco. They also dont want to deal with the costs.
