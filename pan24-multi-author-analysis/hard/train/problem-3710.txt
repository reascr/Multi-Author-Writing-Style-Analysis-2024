This isn’t a Russian offense. This is just what typical human beings do to their environment. This feels like anti Russian propaganda. I can only imagine what ecocide was caused by any/all warring nations. This story isn’t a special or egregious offense but another casualty of war. I wasn’t aware of this reality but it seems like a common occurrence not endemic to Russia’s offensive.
I’m sure dolphins and whales were cool when usa got bombed by Japan and vice versa. I don’t think you really realize wtf I’m saying. This article has the equivalent depth of saying, “ unprecedented deaths of Ukrainian people are dying since Russia invaded Ukraine”. When fighting erupts, all things in that area die. It’s a common occurrence.
thats because it is just propaganda. although we both agree on what you said, do you agree with me when i say: ukraine is killing an unprecedented number of both russians and dolphins?
Now it’s clear we agree: Russia is killing an ‘unprecedented amount’ of both Ukrainians and dolphins.
From the article: ‘… unprecedented reports of dead dolphins and porpoises washing up on Black Sea beaches since Russia invaded Ukraine.’.
