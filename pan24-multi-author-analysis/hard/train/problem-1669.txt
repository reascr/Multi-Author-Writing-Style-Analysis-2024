“…data obtained by The Times showed that over the last two years, the agency could not reach more than 85,000 children. Overall, the agency lost immediate contact with a third of migrant children.”.
Emphasis mine. This is disgusting.It is inhumanely negligent at best, as well as being state sanctioned child trafficking.
I got to read the entire article and it is basically human trafficking. When unaccompanied migrant children get handed over to ‘sponsors’, they are being handed over to the people who will immediately traffick them.
I wish I could send you the screenshot, but of the many many companies involved with child migrant labor use is Ben and Jerry’s and their spokesperson said the MOST fucked thing ever. In a nutshell, they said they work to make sure that working conditions follow the minimum standards and if underage child migrants need to work, then it’s better they work at a place with good working conditions. The dairy industry, according to this article, is amongst the highest in reporting injuries to workers of all industries. Just incredibly tone deaf and looks like I’ll really have to do my homework to find a substitute for ice cream.
