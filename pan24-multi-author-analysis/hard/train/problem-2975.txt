This is what we did in Spain last year. Lights, helmets, hand signals, obeying lane rules and traffic signals or you get a big-ass fine. Since then I have noticed a significant, but not complete, reduction in the number of lawless assholes and idiot kids in the middle of traffic on these things.
Hmm, there is something to this, just forcing them to obey basic road etiquette and actually enforcing it would indeed go a long way to ameliorate most of the basic issues people are pissed about...
Too often they are driven by people that think they own the road and think everybody should give them space...
It's not the scooters themselves, it's the attitude of the people using them that's most of the problem here together with them cluttering up every street corner, because people are just dumping them everywhere and there aren't really any dedicated places where they are parked or situated in contrast with the Velibs for example.
They have become so popular so quickly and remained unregulated for most of that time, that I get why some people want them gone...
