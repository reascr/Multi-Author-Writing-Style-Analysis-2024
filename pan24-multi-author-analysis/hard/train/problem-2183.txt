But that argument is nonsense... at least in our day and age. In the late 18th century perhaps that would fly... but we have different expectations now.
Even without voting, it could be argued that technically they are represented... as residents of a given area.
There's an argument in the article that the state constitution says only citizens can vote. However reading the constitution, it clearly says that citizens have the right to vote. It doesn't say anything about non citizens.
DC residents can still vote in local elections. Same for residents of Puerto Rico. This bill would make that an option for tax paying non citizens in RI. I don't like the fact that those two places don't have federal representation, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about the specifics to really go further than that.
I hope this bill becomes law, and that more people feel empowered to participate in making their community a better place.
Because the community whose elections they'd be participating in decides to make it legal for them to do so. That's how democracy works.
