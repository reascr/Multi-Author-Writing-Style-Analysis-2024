From a societal standpoint, one might argue that everyone get's to live to the age of 80 and once they reach this age, medical treatments for major issues are no longer provided. Like you would no longer put people aged 80 and up on the operation table for cancer removal or hip replacements or something like that, but offer pain killers and other "ease of living" medicine to them, while also giving the option of assisted suicide for those who feel their medical situation has deteriorated to an unbearable level.
To be fair, if you were raised with the expectation of being euthanized at a certain age and it becoming culturally ingrained in people, I bet there would be little opposition. Suicide has been ingrained in Japanese culture as well.
In some sense, we do a similar thing allready in most Western nations because in most geriatric situations, treatments are no longer aimed at curing the underlying disease or medical issue but rather making it bearable to live with it. The component of assisted suicide is not present though. We should, however, have the discussion on the ethics of having someone die painfully over a long period. Medically assisted suicide should be revisited by experts as an option for those who suffer from incurable deseases.
I do they should have assisted suicide for people for terminal illnessesâ€¦ hell even with people that have crippling mental illness(this should be a time though).
