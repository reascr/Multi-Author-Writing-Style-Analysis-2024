Address that to your country's government too. I mean...if these stations are known...why does barely any country seem to do anything about it?
Close them down. Governements of the affected countries should be furious and take action. Instead we get strongly worded statements and that's it.
You banned all foreigners from travelling to China and later requested everyone to have a negative pcr test and upload all kinds of personal information. And then when you enter China you're put in quarantine for 8 days at some state run facility (not your hotel). And you also have to pay for it!
Get off your high horse when some countries now demand a stupid basic COVID test of any traveller (not just chinese) that comes from China.
Oh no, China wont let me come there because they are mad at other countries not letting their people in?
The reaction to chinese travel is only what china would do, if the situation was reversed, and to be honest, it beijing gies ahead and blocks entry to china from certain nations then for me,.it would be no great loss. Being of an age of increased risk I certainly wouldn't go there until i was sure that the risk level was comparable to the country where I am living.
Absolutely no reason to allow unrestricted travel until china have the disease under control. When other nations have worked extremely hard to bring it under control and gone through very serious hardships to be able to lead a normal life again, it would.be insane to allow chinese travellers to jeopardize the progress made by bringing in waves of new infection.
Time and again, history has shown that travel and intermingling can have serious negative consequences, and with the world still recovering from the economic shock of lockdowns we should be learning from recent history.
