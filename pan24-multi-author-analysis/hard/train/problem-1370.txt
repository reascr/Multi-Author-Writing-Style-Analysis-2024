So basically as anyone who thinks critically could have predicated, euthanasia is going to be used as a tool and pushed more and more to remove the "undesirables"... basically anyone disabled or poor under the guise of compassionate care.
Whatever one thinks of euthanasia as it pertains to the terminally ill, there's no doubt that in a society that's focused on capital over care that there will be many casualties as a result of these policies.
Fully agree that euthanasia should be allowed for terminal conditions and if a kid had a terminal condition that’s fair, but in other countries the threshold is becoming lower and lower and we have to make sure we don’t get to the point where there are are no resources to help their condition except euthanasia.
I agree in principle, but if anyone does further research into the euthanasia situation in Canada, it's really quite appalling just how low the threshold is for assisted suicide. It's especially bad how many disabled people in Canada are receiving such low financial support that they almost are indirectly being pushed into considering assisted suicide. ODSP gets you around $20K/year, regardless of the cost of living where you are in Ontario. Even in Toronto, a severely disabled person would only get around $20K/year and lives on the brink of poverty, if not actually well below the poverty line.
