I hardly think it's at all pessimistic to remind people that they can't just breathe a sigh of relief and check out of politics until the next election because things didn't go quite as badly as they could have this time. Complacency is how we end up with a repeat of 2016.
My point: the next few DECADES are no time for complacency. Like it or not, Democrats and non-Republicans generally need to show the same disciplined commitment to voting in EVERY election as Republicans and Pro Life advocates have demonstrated since Roe v Wade. Politics REQUIRES effort, and as someone who has voted in every election since I turned 19 (yes, I skipped a fall odd-year local election at home when I was a freshman in college across the country), I have no sympathy for ANY reason not to vote.
Equal parts deep cynicism about what the GOP has become and deep cynicism concerning Democrats inability to nominate candidates who'd appeal to independent voters.
That said, McCarthy personally and Republicans generally would deserve the agony a Republican majority of fewer than 10 seats in the House of Representatives would produce. A Democratic majority would be far better, but a razor thin Republican majority just might hasten the disintegration of the GOP, collapsing under the inconsistencies between the idiots, the cowards and the insurrectionists.
It's not like Graham harbors any realistic presidential ambition, so what it takes for national electability, including Republicans in states other than South Carolina (and it's not like Graham gives a rat's ass about Tim Scott's relection), is a matter of indifference to him.
