The democrats cant do shit if they’re getting obstructed every single fucking year by some dipshit republican who has a grudge. What are they supposed to do? You act like it’s easy to do. The democrats problem the last decade+ is that they are too ideological meaning they want everything perfectly done and by the book which is what you’re supposed to do and i applaud that but when you have the Republican Party pulling every dirty sleazy trick in the book and perpetually just obstructing progress to get back at “the libs” Then at some point you gotta just give out a few dirty uppercuts of your own otherwise it’s just a continual circle of zero progress and further division of the country. Fuck that.
Fuck that and do what? Republicans use the same claims to justify their dirty uppercuts. In the end, it's just a continual circle of zero progress and further division so long as people feel justified in their pettiness. Finding quality candidates that can rise above is most certainly not easy, but it is necessary, as is replacing politicians that have proven themselves unable to do so. Worst case, you end up with a new crop of lousy officials, best case is actual change.
Sounds just as petty as the rest of politics has become. And here I had the crazy idea they were voted in to collectively do what is best for the nation and their constituents.
How do we get past the "they did it first" mentality or payback for perceived slights and start governing for all?
