AFAIK there’s been no specifying that PAC-4 missiles would be used. Given trends with other weapon systems donated, it seems the Army will probably be sending older generation interceptors that might be near retirement date. That would be somewhat more economical.
The broader point about NASAMs being more appropriate is still a valid one though— sidewinders are ridiculously common, and the system has lower training barriers.
NASAMS, with its ability to use comparably cheaper and more plentiful AMRAAM and Sidewinder missiles, is far more interesting. As is the Flakpanzer Gepard, which Ukraine has been using to great effect to cheaply shoot down Iranian drones.
I'm kind of shocked that this is news to you, the use of Javelin and Stinger missiles in Ukraine has received extremely widespread news coverage.
They sent thousands of stingers to Ukraine, they had some of them before the war even started. They are an important part of why the Russian airforce has been a non-factor in Ukraine the entire war, every babushka and her dog has a stinger stashed away.
The US sent roughly 1,400 Stingers to Ukraine, reportedly around one quarter of its stockpile. Nobody's talked much about it since around May, when the US made some orders to backfill what they'd sent. It's uncertain if the US ever sent more since they aren't currently being manufactured and there's been some challenges in starting up the production lines again.
I'm somewhat annoyed by the focus on Patriot systems. Sending them is largely symbolic (signifying a change in what NATO is willing to provide rather than any substantial change in aggregated deployed capability), they're extraordinarily expensive to use ($4 million per missile for PAC-4) and there won't be very many of them. As such they will only ever be used extremely sparingly for the most important targets. And yet everybody acts like they're going to be some sort of game changer.
