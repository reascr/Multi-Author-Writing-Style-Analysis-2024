Nah canada is a leading country when it comes time to dealing with chinas shit. They are a trading partner but we have laws in place that stop other countries to do to us what china is doing to europe and the US. CHINA cant hold canada by the balls and they hate it.
In my experience most chinese canadians don't want anytning to do wjth the CPC. A large number of them back politicians and parties that are against the CPC, are highly religious(which is against communism in general), an increasing number of them are pro marijuana, and regularly prostest anything involving the CPC. For a lot of chinese canadians and chinese people living in Canada, life in Canada has become about enjoying freedoms they don't have in their native country and moving their assets to a place the COC can't possibly touch, which is a big part of the housing issue.
Chinese people are a sizable minority in Canada. In some places like Richmond they're the ethnic majority. But to my experience any affinity for China is mostly cultural and almost none of it is political.
But I will agree the chinese canadian love of china is largely a love of the culture or traditions rather than the country as it actually exists in 2022.
Maybe its just becauae I live near a lot of temples and churches but I don't think religious people in the chinese canadian community are that rare. Whenever a local church or temple does anything they draw increasingly large crowds, to the point where they're beginning to become comparable to larger festivals on some occasions within the last year or two.
