To be fair for Hong Kong it was cuz we stopped protesting because of the pandemic and then couldn't restart because of the national security law... fair point on the others though.
The root of the conflict is that Jews felt the need for a state due to pogroms, racism, and genocides across Europe, and Palestine was the only real place for it. That in itself is complicated given the fact that whether you think that's justification for trying to make a nation state is itself complicated, not to mention the location and method etc., as well as the fact that the Yishuv initially didn't have nearly as much conflict as modern Israel today, although conflict still existed.
Lastly I will finish with this, the Palestinians who remained in Israel gained full citizenship with all the rights it comes with, sure there is racism, it's awful but it's a problem that exists all around the world(same reason we have suffered, tribalism makes humans target minorities since they are such easy scapegoats, especially in our case, in the midst of such a charged conflict). Palestinians who have arrived to Arab countries however became refugees, as did their descendants. Only in Jordan in where the majority is Palestinian did they get citizenship.
There's a reason Egypt and Jordan refused the lands Israel offered, and it isn't because the Palestinians are a pleasant people.
Israel occupying Palestine is not, in of itself, justification for what HAMAS is doing. Especially when you consider why Israel is occupying them. Hence why this is not a black and white conflict, but very gray.
And then Reddit thinks this conflict is black and white rather than the messy very very gray and complicated conflict it is.
