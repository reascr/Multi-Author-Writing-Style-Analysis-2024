Something about the way Germany behaves now makes me upset. It's cowardly that modern Germans are so against supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons. The biggest bully of the 20th century now suddenly is ardently against weaponizing a nation that is struggling to survive. They act like they have a reason to be so against war. For once, Germany can thrive and be on the good side of history, but they seem so afraid. Like they're morality-bound to never be involved in war again. It's fine to be involved with war. Just don't fucking do what you all did throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Shit gets to me.
Germany wants to make money while France keeps the old empires in check as best it can in Africa and the Middle East. I think that's a cowardly position for the Germans to take given their history. They don't get pity for being destroyed. They had to be destroyed and now they want to sit the hard decisions out.
Germany still had a gigantic wall splitting it down the middle \30 years ago that the Russians installed. Poland isn't the only one with a good reason to out spend everybody on defense.
I mean Poland has a pretty good reason to out spend everybody on defense.. geographically there are country that gets steamrolled anytime somebody has the bright idea to conquer all of Europe.
