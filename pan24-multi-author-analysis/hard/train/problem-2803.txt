Cooler heads tend to prevail throughout a lot of the most heated situations, especially in more modern history. There are so many factors involved, no one really wants a major war between NATO, and I don't think an accident, even one where allegedly 2 people died, is going to really push anyone over the edge. It's absolutely tragic if a few people did die, don't get me wrong, but is 2 people dying in most likely a total accident, really worth probably millions?
Russia didn't attack Poland here. This is most certainly an accident. Some Belarusian soldiers near the border testing their own equipment that probably fucked up or misfired. If Russia was attacking Poland they aren't going to hit a farm in bumble fuck no where.
The response from NATO is simple: Move more air defense and air awareness capabilities the borders around Belarus and Ukraine and continue sending money to help end this war sooner so accidents stop happening. Nations that aren't on the brink of going to war themselves tend not to fire off missiles in such provocative locations.
If their missiles are so untrustworthy that there is a risk to neighbouring countries then they shouldnt ben using them period. If i'm aiming rubber bands at my little brothers head and accidentally hit the sleeping pitbulls nutsack next to my little brother then i may have had nothing to gain and yes, it might have been and accident, but i shouldnt be surprised if there are consequences. Accountability is a thing you know, who aims unreliable missiles next to a NATO country. What a nutty thing to do.
