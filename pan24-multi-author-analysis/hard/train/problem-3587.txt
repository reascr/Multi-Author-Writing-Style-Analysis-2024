You see, communists want a stateless, classless, and moneyless society. Without money you have no classes. So that’s one down and one more to go.
That’s okay. Given the standards the state has set for elder care, there are gonna be some interesting times ahead for those people. They’ll deserve everything they get in the nursing homes to come.
Frankly, he’s betting he can do whatever he wants for two reasons: Florida was the only sound choice for Disney World when it was created, and it’d be nigh impossible to find a replacement with a suitable climate in the US (also…the price!) Disney World isn’t going anywhere; DeSantis has Disney at gunpoint.
They aren’t going to spend billions to relocate unless they know they won’t have the same problem elsewhere. Thing is, the south is run by Republicans who are apt to try the same stuff as DeSantis. So again, he can do more or less whatever he wants with Disney - they’ll never move until there’s a reliable blue or purple state in the South.
Disney should go to tender to other states to relocate Florida disneyland, maybe not necessarily go through with it, but just put it out there. See how Florida reacts to losing their single largest tourist trap.
Which is what DeSantis and his idiots think. So if they make overtures to even \_imply\_ they are moving, that'll rattle a lot of cages and make a lot of people freak out which may force Desantis' hand to back down.
