Lol this part SENT ME - how the hell did that make it into the final cut? it's beyond obvious that A) he's reading off a teleprompter and B) this video is the stiched-together Frankenstein of dozens of reads by Trump - how the hell did this make it in??
Like there are ways he could have made that seem kinda personable - something like "it might not sound so amazing to me, because I always love meeting my supporters anyway..." but no we just get "it's what we have.".
I dunno man - the Four Seasons Landscaping press conference has always been my favorite moment in the Trump Cinematic Universe, but I gotta say the writers are really hitting their stride again this season. This shit is positively gut-busting.
Literally had to pause the video to laugh out loud for a few minutes when he said "...like dinner with me - I dunno if that's an amazing prize but it's what we've have.".
They. Arent. Even. NFT's. The site explicitly says there is no limit to how many will be sold and they are for entertainment and not investing. They are literally nothing. You're paying Trump for the privilege of paying Trump. That is it.
But that's not ALL! The first 1000 people who order will also receive a 24kt genuine gold plated facsimile of a reproduction of Trump's first $1 bill he ever grifted.
