He’s not wrong. If you think the various medias of the world don’t specifically pick and choose what they want to write articles about then I would just ask that you realize they do. They’re made up of fallible people, like you and me.
how do you explain then when way before Netanyahu was elected , during the Palestinian Infitadas the Palestinians sent hundreds of suicide bombers during the 90’s and early 2000’s?
Incoming Palestinian sympathizers demanding the Jews in Israel let themselves be massacred . It’s literally in the Hamas charter (who Palestinians democratically elected in Gaza) to wipe out Israel and the Jews … I wish both sides could come to peace.
“Come on guys, we have all decided to try to stop murdering every single Jew and are just are settling for 98%!” Hamas, probably, when they updated their charter.
If Israel wanted to wipe out 98% of all Palestinians, why haven't they done so? Palestine doesn't have the capability to stop them.
And strangely during that time didn't set up an independent Palestinian state. Then 3 years later went to war with the PLO (Black September War) and kicked them out of Jordan.
