Do you recall how after the fall of rome monastic orders maintained and reproduced histories, records, and technological advances from that age eventually allowing europe to rediscover those otherwise lost advances in civilization?
I'm merely pointing that above poster overstated things and that religion has and continues to do good as well as evil in the world.
My core point, which I believe I may have strayed from (and I apologize for that), is that people have a great capability for good or evil and religion is simply a tool for either. To blame religion for evil in the world is like blaming cars for car accidents. Religion is a tool to explain the unknown, give purpose, and connect people. Unfortunately, that can be used in very negative ways too.
History and every evidence point agrees with me. My point is not to undermine evil, my point is that it's a weak and petty cop out to put the blame on religion when it's humanity we should blame.
Oh, and with that logic, any crimes committed by fundamentalists have nothing to do with the religion, because the religion is not relevant there.
My point is that while religion has been the source of many bad things history; there's overwhelming evidence that humanity can be extremely evil, with or without it. And the evidence goes even further to suggest that religion is less of a factor.
Evidence suggests that we could be better off without religion. It also shows we are capable of devastating evil without it as well.
