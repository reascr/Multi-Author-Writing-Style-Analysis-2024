That is what many of us don't realize -- putin will not be replaced by a peaceful democracy. We are also fighting the next few totalitarian dictators to come after him right now. All of Russia needs to learn to keep their pathetic shit within their own borders moving forward.
A lot of western corporate money will go to a more stable Ukraine, once it is rebuilt and fortified its borders, rather than risk this craziness that Russia is intent on causing.
The primary existential threat to the Kremlin is a bunch of Russians looking at an increasingly Western-aligned and prosperous Ukraine, decade after decade, and starting to wonder why things are so much better just across the border.
Never mind the cognitive dissonance that Russia is explicitly targeting Ukrainian civilians and that western "expansionism" is just their neighbors turning to the West because they don't want to be invaded by Russia.
Either Russia planned to provoke the West so hard they actually attacked Russia, Russia actually wanted to invade some part of NATO, or Russia simply _did not care hardly at all about proximity to NATO_. Russia did not want NATO advancing east because their plan was always to reclaim as much of the Russian Empire, or of the USSR, as possible. NATO membership is only a threat to Russian imperialism.
This argument _does_ make sense, but it only makes sense if you believe Russia _deserves_ the claims of the Russian Empire, like the US believed it _deserved_ Manifest Destiny, or Britain believed it _deserved_ India. It's all imperialist horseshit, and the justifications for each step will always be made up.
