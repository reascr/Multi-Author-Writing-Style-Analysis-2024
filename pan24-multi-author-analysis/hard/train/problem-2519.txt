At this point they must be aware that whatever they accuse Ukraine of will be assumed as their plan. Maybe they are aware and this is yet another backhanded way of threatening nuclear escalation?
Yeah seems very odd that they would let it be known that they were loading nuclear missiles on warships unless it was just another tactic which is very likely with that dirty bastard.
My guess is that they're hoping for a nuclear "accident", actively trying to fuck up the reactors... However, as other people have mentioned, the reactors are protected in ways that would minimize the effects of a meltdown.
That being said, if a reactor has a catastrophic meltdown in Ukraine, it would still be cause for foreign intervention to at least clear the area and stop radioactive pollution from spreading into the rest of Europe. And that's something that's absolutely on the minds of Russian leaders.
I mean, the unfortunate reality is this would be a disaster for the entirety of Europe and international intervention would be required to at least slow the spread of radioactive materials and entomb the reactor.
