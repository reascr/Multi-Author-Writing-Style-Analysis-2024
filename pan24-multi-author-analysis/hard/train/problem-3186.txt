And their apologists. Someone had the audacity to suggest the west just didn't understand, and that crippling Ukraine's power and infrastructure was Putin's goal from the very beginning of the invasion, i.e. basically, it's all going according to his plan.
Like yeah, destroy Russia's influence and fear factor on the world stage, kill (edit: and wound) over 100,000 Russian soldiers/conscripts, destroy or lose much of their modern military equipment, get neutral nations to apply to NATO and double the Russian border with NATO members, get the EU and UK to drastically reduce reliance on Russian energy and accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels in general, get sanctioned all to hell by the world so they can't even get replacement ball bearings to run their trains...
All that, just to cripple Ukraine's power infrastructure for the coming winter. All part of Putin's original plan from the start. Uh-huh. Sure.
Of course. I'm just setting the record straight that people literally cheered in the streets, en masse, when Sadam was overthrown. Also, it wasn't just some staged propaganda; the vast majority of the citizenry acted that way.
I just wanted to keep us grounded in reality instead of acting like the US wasn't greeted as liberators in Iraq by most of the people of Iraq.
I mean, the Iraq thing was true, at least until the realities of Islamic sectarian retribution and power vacuum set in. The vast majority of Iraq was stoked to be rid of Sadam. But replacing his regime was a complicated process and there were a lot of axes to grind by the majority against the previous ruling minority sect. In not justifying the invasion, rather I'm stating the nuanced truth of what happened there due to the removal of Sadam.
