Hitting yourself in the dick with a hammer to own the libs. This is feels over reals taken to its ultimate, most braindead self sabotaging conclusion. Do it, idiots.
What a bunch of morons. My candidate didn’t win so I won’t certify any of the votes in my county and will make the other candidate’s margin of victory even bigger. Taking election denial to a new level.
This rigged election bit? It's softening up the Right for a pitch for no elections. "No democracy, no democrats.".
Oh, please happen. But honestly, they'll spin it as Democrats disenfranchising the county. "See? We were right, it was rigged. When our votes meant xyz would win, they didn't even count us.".
If it’s not this, it’s something else. They’re obviously not going to stop. If by now you’re not anticipating “more radical political action”, I’ve got news for you. Let them have at it. It’s not like the US hasn’t been through worse.
Well, clearly it will be pointless for voters in Republican-leaning Cochise County to show up at the polls in 2024, seeing as they stand to be disenfranchised by their political party of choice.
So, sue the shit out of these craven enablers enjoying their moment in the tainted sun and carry on.
