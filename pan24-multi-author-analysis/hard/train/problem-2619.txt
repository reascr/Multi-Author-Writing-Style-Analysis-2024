When the founding fathers of the United States signed a document saying "All men are created equal," most of them didn't mean it and their actions didn't match it. But one would have to be both ridiculously cynical and historically illiterate to think the fact they wrote those words didn't matter.
For two and a half centuries, the words they never really meant have lived on as a sword in the hands of the oppressed. The world is a better place today because they claimed high ideals as their justification for creating America as an independent nation, and because they thereby permanently opened America to rebuke with its own hypocrisy.
The U.S. is a "freekin' awesome country" because it was founded upon enlightenment ideals (to which it asymtotically approaches), is a bastion of freedom, has become the most powerful nation to have ever existed, creates peace and hope, does awesome things like landing on the moon, has altered the direction of history for the better, and created the greatest food of all time: Pizza.
Stopped a bunch of genocide in various places. Killed several dictators and a bunch of jihadis, Kosavo, pirates, counter-balanced other powers. Prevented WWIII. Yeah, doing pretty well.
Yeah, could been putting in more work, but you'll notice that SpaceX is an American company and they are basically the biggest space program around. (Props to Elon).
