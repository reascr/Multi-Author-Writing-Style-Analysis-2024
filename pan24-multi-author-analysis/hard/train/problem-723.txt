We had a year and a half of zero covid while your lot were dying in droves. During this time most of the population was vaccinated. Then Omicron arrived and no one can contain Omicron so our borders were opened and we all started getting covid.
No we are not. You may not have noticed but we have a ton of covid already which is why it won't make much difference especially since the tests are not reliable.
Yes I was boasting about not ever getting covid in early December Tested positive the same day. Lol. Our rates say half the population but it is definitely under reported. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. If you do get it hopefully it will be mild. It was for us but we are very vaccinated.
That is not how vaccine efficacy is tested. Independent teams in different countries used the vaccine to see how effective it was.
Either that or she (or her team) understands that as the whole world has covid now and most people are vaccinated. Preventing people from one single country to get in when you already have covid everywhere doesn't really make any sense, and even less when the most contagious variant of covid right now and for which vaccines don't seem to work very well (XBB) is not even in China at the moment, but mostly in the US.
