And even this is water under the bridge. People who did it are dead. What matters is intentions of alive people. And alive poles intend to kick russian ass until it's blue and purple seems to me. Who could ask for better friends? .
I am with them. You cannot be lobbing missiles into NATO territory and killing NATO citizens. It's insane.
but that would be nuts. They could go into Ukraine to fight Russia and would Russia be able to strike back into Poland?
And I would like to be that one Ukrainian who says that I wish that one day Russia will support us just as much as Poland does despite our previous conflicts. Fuck Putin, and the Russian government, and my cousin who is a Russian citizen who supports war, but there are still good people there.
Russia is more than you guy's common enemy, and you are more to each other than just momentary allies. You're brothers, and you should look out for another. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a hurricanes waves will drown all of you all the same. Who cares which side of a randomly drawn border you're born at, what language you speak. Recognize who is the current asshole, and who are your friends. That's it.
We should always make different choices, work together to make ourselves whole where we can, and continue to work together and do right by each other where we can't.
