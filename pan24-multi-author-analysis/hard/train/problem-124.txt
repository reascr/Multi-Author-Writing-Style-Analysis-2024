Now, back to the topic at hand, it is very interesting to hear that popular support in russia for the invasion has dramatically decreased, hopefully this leads to even more discontent within the russian population against their government.
Russia is a failed state with zero democracy or morality as shown by the fact that they, in 2022 none the less, tried to invade a European country and attempting to assassinating president Zelensky. If they had succeeded with their "3 day invasion", they surely would not have stopped at the Ukrainian border.
However, that is as irrelevant as bringing up what the US has done when discussing russia's invasion of Ukraine that is currently undergoing.
Itâ€™s sometimes hard to imagine how putin could possibly have any support from Russian citizens at this point, but then I remember that trump still has the heads of half of America shoved firmly up his ass.
Somehow I haven't yet met a single pro-war person among those Russians from Russia who are abroad, and I'd say there were less than 10% supporting the war among those whom I dealt with in Russia (I wouldn't say my circle could represent a typical person though).
