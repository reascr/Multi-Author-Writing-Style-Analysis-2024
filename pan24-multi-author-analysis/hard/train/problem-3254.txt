When Europe runs into energy problems because their oil imports come under pressure they turn to coal as their fuel. So keeping them secure in oil is a large net positive for the planet. It will take time to move to renewable energy everywhere. If you just turn off oil without a proper alternative you end up making things worse.
The reality is that we should have been phasing out oil decades ago. We didn’t. You can’t just set up green energy overnight. Until we have a replacement, we have to use what we have.
Are you willing to turn off your power? Would you rather the world financially support regimes like in Russia and Iran? Should millions die from exposure so that we can shut off all fossil fuels tomorrow?
I’m not even saying get rid of all fossil fuels immediately, its fucking common sense at this point. We are live watching our country get left behind. I am just so sick of the democrats having terrible messaging and not getting behind winning ideas.
Honestly, the real solution (yet one that both parties lack the will and gall to go through with) is a large scale investment in green tech, rebuilding our electric grids to support a sustainable future, partially funded by tax increases on fossil fuels, as well as a removal of their subsidies (and harsh fines for the market gouging they have been doing). I would have no problem with investments in oil to help with the transition, but the green focus isn’t there on the level it needs to be so this kind of news is disappointing.
