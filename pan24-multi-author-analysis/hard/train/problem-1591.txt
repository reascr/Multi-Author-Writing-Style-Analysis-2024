They ARE the SDF. The US just rebranded them due to the PR disaster that the YPG was engaging in before the US got involved with them, namely forced evictions of native residents in territories they controlled, which continued all the way up to 2015-16 when the US forced them to stop.
Oh, also. Wanna know why the Kurds have never been able to unite under a single flag? It's because a third are Islamist, a third are communist, and a third actually don't care about independence and are okay with just trying to get more rights in the nations they live in.
The PKK are literally designated by the US and EU as terrorist organizations. The YPG literally has members (including leaders) that are a part of the PKK.
The YPG actually shared values with the rest of europe and fought against ISIS, while turks helped isis.
It is in NATO's interest to work closely with both the Turks and the Kurds. Therefore it is in NATO's interest to permanent pursue peace talks between the Turks and the Kurds. In my mind, that leads to the creation of a Kurdish state, likely carved out of Syria.
The Turks have a genocidal obsession with the Kurds. You can't trust them. They think every Kurd is " PKK".
And no, the YPG are not "progressive". Also don't excuse this sort of behavior just because they're "progressive" in your opinion.
