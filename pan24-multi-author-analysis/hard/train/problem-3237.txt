if it's supposed to be positive PR for Qatar, so far I'm learning a lot of awful shit about that country that I didn't know before the World Cup hit the news cycle the last couple of weeks.
Yeah it’s not right that this is the way that it is in Qatar but it seems like people are fucking around and subsequently surprised when they find out.
To the argument that visitors in Qatar should respect Qatar customs, usually I would agree. But Qatar was chosen to host a global event. Visitors are paying a lot of money to travel, attend, and stay in Qatar. No one is expecting Qatar to change their laws against homosexuality (despite general outcry), but they should be welcoming hosts to a global population that largely supports homosexuality.
Hopefully this is an opportunity for Qatar to learn from other cultures. While the world can also respect Qatar's culture, we shouldn't bow to hateful practices.
If you think about it from the perspective of Qatar, though, it really doesn’t make sense for them to allow it. You can get killed in that country for being gay, so why would they allow gay representation in their country? I am not a Qatar fan, I really dislike the Middle East in general, but they also have customs that should be taken into account.
