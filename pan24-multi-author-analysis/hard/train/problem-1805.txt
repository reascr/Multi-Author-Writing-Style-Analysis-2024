I mean rejoining Transjordan is probably the best option but the Jordanians hate the Palestinians cause they outnumber them and treated refugees in Jordan like crap.
Oh yeah, Jordan fought a war with Israel half a century ago that create a refugee problem for them, never omit this part.
Oh yeah, Jordan fought a war with Israel half a century ago. Since then Jordan has been the most conciliatory and neighborly country towards Israel of all of the Arab states surrounding it. And Israel refuses to repatriate any of their refugees because their chief domestic policy is ethnic cleansing.
Jordan is the most stable country of all of Israel's neighbors, and they've put up with a lot of bullshit, and their population is already like 20% refugees from Israel, Syria, & Iraq. But yeah, I guess they draw the line at Israel potentially doubling their refugee population with a flood of new deported Palestinians.
Also, the refugees are a result of their attacks on Israel in 48 and 67, so it would be ridiculous to draw a red line there. "We have attacked you twice and lost, stop creating a refugee problem for us"?
