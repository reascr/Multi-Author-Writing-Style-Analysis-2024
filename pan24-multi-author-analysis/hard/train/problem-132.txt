The soviets did not go to war to free the jews, no country did. despite the fact jews told the world what the nazis are doing even during the war.
And that's just what they did during ww2, later on jews in the soviet union were banned from certain professions and were litterally sent to the gulag if they were suspected zionists.
The auschwitz extermination camp might've never existed without the soviet support until 1941, and it wouldn't've exterminated as many jews if the russians didn't stop at the border.
Which is wild because there were plenty of contemporary testimonies of Russian officials horrified of the things they saw in the camps (Although the Russian army did their share of atrocities in their way to Berlin as well).
Russia took over Nazi concentration camps and also created many of their own, but to the best of my knowledge they never ran any extermination camps.
To be fair, concentration camps and extermination camps are not the same thing. Extermination camps were literal death factories; people went in the front and corpses went out the back. The death rate at concentration camps was in the ballpark of 50%. At extermination camps it was 99.9%.
