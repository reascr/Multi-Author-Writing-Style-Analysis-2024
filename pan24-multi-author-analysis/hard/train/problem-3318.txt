It would also be the best way to get war debts repaid, a crippled economy constantly having money removed will not make as much money and be less able to repay debts. Better to build up their economy.
And given the EU wants to get Ukraine aligned to their rules and economic standards for eventual membership, as seems to be Ukrainian aspirations, more likely you see European investment. That would fit EU's desired outcomes. The US has mostly got what it wanted, which is another Russian Afghanistan to bleed and decrease the capabilities of a rival, it gains quite a lot geopolitically. It'll want some things, but I doubt it's going to do what people here seem to be imagining, Ukraine aligning with the EU would be a general win for the US as well tbh.
How much would you be willing to bet that they are probably not doing this out of concern for the people of Ukraine and the pure goodness of their hearts?
This is why I don't trust either side of this war, whatever is left of Ukraine by the time this ends is already up for auctions for the vultures on this side of the western world. Not saying whatever Russia takes will be better off but in the end this whole war and follow up is being built on top of Ukranian graves and we are supposed to cheer for that.
