Live In the Midwest too. Thereâ€™s amazing polish and German places. Pretty good Italian places(mom and pop Italian places that make different homemade pasta noodles each morning), great Mexican food, a great Salvadoran restaurant. Thereâ€™s also really good Vietnamese and African restaurants. Plus others in forgetting. Thatâ€™s all within a 20 minute drive.
Not sure how to explain it other than I just didnâ€™t have good food? I spent about a month in each country so I had a fairly good idea of the food. 90% of my meals were at food carts or little local restaurants with those tiny plastic chairs. So the type of restaurants I went to were all the same across Asia.
A lot of food is hella derivative, even Asian stuff in the SE. However compared to EU, thereâ€™s less varieties of food and a lot can be a direct impact of colonialism that elevates the variety of food in European countries.
Personally I love American food but I agree it doesnâ€™t need to be that high, as long as itâ€™s higher than the UK countries though ðŸ˜‰.
Iâ€™ve backpacked around loads of countries(all over Asia and Europe) and I was pleased surprised at the backpackers I met who had been to the US and said itâ€™s some of the best food theyâ€™ve ever had. And thatâ€™s coming from people that have 20-100 countries checked off their list.
This is just a random list of countries. Some Twitter account trying to conjure up controversies for extra traffic. Just a stupid article and stupid list nobody should pay any attention to.
