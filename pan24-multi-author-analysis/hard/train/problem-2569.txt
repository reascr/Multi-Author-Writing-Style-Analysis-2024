What in the fuck are you talking about it’s not at all like that if anything it is very touristy with a couple of choirs/sermons on some days the whole place has electricity I’m tired of you westerners larping about being in Ukraine.
I’m half Ukrainian and I was last in Kyev in 2018 before that 2014 before that 2010 before that 2008 before that I lived in Черновцах as an infant. Your description makes it appear as if you’re going into some dark cave where the only light source is candles and everything is very mystic and surreal whereas I found it to be way more mainstream and touristy. Basically you’re over-exaggerating.
You want mystic and surreal go to the monasteries in Briansk or Solovky (where the real pilgrimage for Russian orthodoxy is not the Larva).
I'm sure there are more interesting Orthodox places to visit but I was giving my own experience of the place mentioned in the article.
I really don't see how it's exaggerating when everything I've said is entirely accurate and confirmed from other sources, apart from the chanting monks but like I said, feel free to dismiss that if you want as I can't prove it. It's a dark place with numerous mummies and where people are encouraged to carry candles around.
Yup, they don't allow photos in the catacombs, although I got a nice photo of the monastery itself.
