The F-16 is one of the most widely exported fighter jets out of the USA. It has an extremely long history of operation and training foreign crews on the airframe. Additionally, for a fighter jet, is relatively easy to learn to operate. Someone who already knows how to operate a fighter jet of any kind should be able to transition with ease and expediency.
I know the Iraqi pilots were in training for years when they began their program, and I’m fairly sure most if not all those guys had been flying MIGs beforehand or some sort of jet.
According to officials the US is expecting it to take around two years just to get Ukrainian pilots proficient with the aircraft. But mastering and actually being effective might take longer.
In aircraft they're trained on. Doing a sortie with little to no training is a suicide mission. You're not going to just hope in a F16 after flying in a SU27 and be able to drop a JDAM or launch a Maverick. You'd just in the sky waiting to die.
Thats what they're referring to. During the Korean war Russia sent their own pilots to fly with and train in.
During the Korean War, the USSR had ‘volunteer’ pilots fly jets while the North Koreans and Chinese learned. I’m pretty sure there are more than a few retired Western pilots willing to ‘volunteer’ despite all the risk.
