Because the world watched Ukraine roll over in 2016 with the annexation of Crimea. Putin figured that since he got away with it once, he could do it again.
However, Ukraine and the rest of the world were ready this time, and surprise underhanded tactics didn't work this time.
Putin's trying to save face. He fucked up, underestimating Ukraine and rather than look weak by pulling out, he's going to keep pushing even if it drags all of Russia down with him.
Maybe it isn't, and we should still support Ukraine fully.. but increasingly it's feeling like just another fake-out by Russia, in a long long long javelin-destroyed caravan of lies.
seeing the west take back their tank commitments pisses me off, they really, really dont want Ukraine to reclaim Crimea.
Ukraine is a full fledged western style democracy and if Ukraine falls, we will be looking at an all-out world war between NATO and Russia. Better to kick Russia's ass in Ukraine and contain the conflict.
The only peaceful solution is for Russia to withdraw entirely from Ukraine, including Crimea. Putin can do that, unilaterally, anytime he wants and Ukraine will stop fighting.
The quicker Ukraine kicks Russia's ass out of all of Ukraine, including Crimea, the sooner this war can come to an end. To do that, Ukraine requires overwhelming force.
No military, not even a drunken one like Russia will "announce" offensives or counter-offensives. As with the invasion, the offensive was identified through intelligence and observed behaviors.
