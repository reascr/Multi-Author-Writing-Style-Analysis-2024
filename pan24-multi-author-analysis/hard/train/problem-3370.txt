And the churches that don't do those things are growing. Far right politics is not biblical. Abortion and same sex marriage aren't biblical. Giving me a bible church. Not a politics church.
If you don't believe me just go to Holland. All the affirming churches are dying a slow and inglorious death. Go to the states - all the mainline denominations that have liberalized are shrinking at a spectacular rate.
That's funny because in the US it's the hardcore evangelical denominations shedding members faster than ever to mainline groups.
It's also important to point out they aren't leaving mainline churches in the Netherlands to find more out of touch churches that still live in the middle ages but abandoning faith altogether.
At least in the US the hardcore evangelical denominations have been the ones that have most openly embraced far-right ideology and mixing politics with religion, though, and the mainline denominations have been the ones adopting more pro-LGBT positions.
I am in full support of LGBTQ+ people, but for the church to support same sex unions seems like they’re admitting that their storybook may not be as relevant to dictating morality like they have previously claimed. They are blatantly going against what is in their scriptures, which is great, but let’s take it further and just scrap the whole thing.
