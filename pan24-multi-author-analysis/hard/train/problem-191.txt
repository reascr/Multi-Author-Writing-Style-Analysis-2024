Lukashenko isn't entirely stupid, he knows that the second the Belarusian conscripts cross the border in to Ukraine he is getting removed from power.
I don't think it makes 'perfect' sense for Belarus - but it makes perfect sense for Russia to strongarm Belarus to go along with a false flag operation.
Kidding yourself if you think somehow NATO would get involved just because Belarus' weak military jumps in.
I must also say I don't believe NATO are planning to do this, things are not at that level and there is nothing for NATO to gain from attacking Belarus.
Now I don't think that will happen and it was a few years they came up with the plan so it might of changed but rhe general idea was it's a way to show Russia NATO are willing to escalate without striking Russia an starting WW3.
It is unlikely that NATO would escalate the use of a tactical nuke in Ukraine be using a tactical nuke in Russia and there are not many other European targets where NATO could use one to prove they willing to not back down.
Interestingly one of NATOs responses to the use of a tactical nuke is to attack Belarusian military facilities (possibly with a tactical nuke).
I should point out that a) I said possibly a tactical nuke, this doesn't mean definitely, b) Russian nuclear doctrine says they will use nuclear weapons to defend Russia, so a NATO strike on Russia soil would give then cause to use nukes, NATO know this and are fully aware of the risks involve with actually attacking Russia and c) I said one of their responses. This doesn't mean it's the likely response or they still have that as a plan. There are properly 100's if not 1000's of possible responses they would of planned out. 99% of them we will never hear of.
