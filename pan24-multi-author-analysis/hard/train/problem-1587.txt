The problem was that the law was written in a way that the technology could be abused by law enforcement. Nothing to stop a cop from stalking their ex, or investigate someone for political reasons, etc.
Or is your point that you ONLY want them to digitize the workflow for investigating tax evasion, and you don't think the technology should be used for other crimes such as murder/robbery/etc.?
You call it incompetence but it's just reality. A human detective cannot reasonably analyze videos from all over the city and read license plates and figure out that a car was spotted near five crime scenes. It would take them forever and we can't have a detective working on 1 case watching videos for weeks.
The software in question is literally just digitizing the workflow that a human investigator would have to go through.
What really grinds my gears, is that there is so much potential to make police work more efficient and effective but rather that digitize the workflow and starting to work on problems like tax evasion they work towards a surveillance state. It so much that should and really has to be done before something like this can ever be an option.
