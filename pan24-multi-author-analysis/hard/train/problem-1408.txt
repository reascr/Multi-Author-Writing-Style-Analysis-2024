Ah, the US giving everyone around the world money except for it's own citizens. They leave us behind and that's the plan. They designing a brand new world and don't give two shits about all the people that keep this country going.
$100 million may not sound like much but it adds up AND furthermore it doesn't help that WE barely get a say in where are taxes are going.

"Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, also says he requested disaster assistance from FEMA, which he says was denied. But the White House says that's because this is not like a hurricane, tornado or another natural disaster where there's widespread property damage.".
