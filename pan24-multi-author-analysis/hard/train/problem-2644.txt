I'm a father who was laid off for requesting a full 12 weeks paternity leave (which my state is one of only 2 states that offers parental leave on a gender neutral basis).
Also, please explain why your statement is not heteronormative because gay couples that adopt face way more hurdles for family leave than women do.
Now that you know my truth, please explain to me why this statement that "it disproportionately affects women" is not complete and utter bull$ +?
My reply was to point out that while both genders are negatively affected by this, that does not make it gender neutral because one is and has been more negatively affected. If this is to be a gender neutral issue, as in we all recognize that both genders are significantly harmed by patriarchal gender stereotypes, then we must also do that do all issues involving sexism. I am absolutely all for that and think we should. However, in doing so, we can not deny the differences in levels of harm, or we will not be able to find solutions that fully support both genders equitably.
