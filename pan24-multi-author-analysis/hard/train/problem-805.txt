3. Attempt to con Trump into standing down and playing the role of “elder GOP statesman,” possibly by offering to pay his legal bills and promising to constantly kiss up to him. He would go along with this for a bit, until Republican fawning over DeSantis became too much and his need to be the alpha male overrode whatever promises he had made. Chaos would ensue, and the party would be fractured.
4. Stick with Trump and encourage DeSantis to wait for the 2028 election. Given that Trump hurt the GOP badly in the 2018 midterms, lost the 2020 presidential election and again hurt Republicans in this year’s midterms, he will be an electoral disaster. He’ll keep prattling on about a stolen election and his cruelty and divisiveness, now known commodities, will doom GOP hopes to win the White House and further tarnish the party’s image.
2. Continue coddling Trump and let the GOP primary play out, which would produce the same outcome as option No. 1.
5. Trump announces run, Desantis agrees to serve as as VP pick 2 years ahead of election. Pair announces first of 1,523 planned rallies for this weekend….
I know it’s unlikely, given the two massive egos, and their individual thirsts for total power, and not to mention neither trusts the other, but it’s still my fear.
