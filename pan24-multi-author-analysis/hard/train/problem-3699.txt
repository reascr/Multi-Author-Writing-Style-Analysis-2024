Most of them are career professionals that could see what would happen if a bunch of goons and cronies took over. They stayed to keep the wheels on the bus but they had to follow orders to stay. It's gotta be a nightmare filling in the brain drain that happened during trump and I can't imagine they've finished making up for the centuries of collective experience lost under trump.
trump was being hounded after his June 1st attack on protesters to call in the military to kill the 1st amendment. Milley came out and said the military wouldn't be used for political purposes.
It's why January 6th happened. After his idiotic bible photoshoot he realized he didn't have the man power through the government to overthrow the government. So he used his violent cult to do it.
"So he used his violent cult to do it". Yeah, you're correct. I remember seeing his violent cult attacking cities across America. Burning down thousands of businesses after they looted them. Senselessly, blockading roads everywhere. They set up that thing in Seattle called CHOP. They attacked random people just walking down the street. My favorite was the May 29th attack on the White House. Yeah, his cult was out of control for about 3 months there in 2020.
How about we hold all people accountable for their actions, regardless of their political/tribal affiliation. Not holding people accountable, is part of the reason western culture is so divided right now.
