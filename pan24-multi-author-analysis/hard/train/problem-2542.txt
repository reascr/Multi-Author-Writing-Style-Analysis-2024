I wouldn't say some outside agency is policing them, it's more like... every single lawyer is policing every other lawyer. Yes, conflicts of interest exist, lawyers who are chummy with one another, Lawyers who work together, or for one another, but, in the aggregate, the entire profession is holding each member of that profession accountable. For a large enough group of people, with enough conflicting priorities, enough different little tribes, this works. Short of these industry wide organizations, almost no self policing body is ACTUALLY policing itself.
It is very possible for an organization to police itself and there are many well established means for doing so. All of them require the organization be run by people who actually, at some point or another, want to establish the necessary structures to make it possible, and all of them from then on do require "buy in" from at least a signficant sub-portion of the organization, but both things are possible.
Very few of the organizations we expect to police themselves have either of those being true and even the ones that do never seem to implement the methods that are likely to make self-policing possible... almost as if they never wanted it to be.
