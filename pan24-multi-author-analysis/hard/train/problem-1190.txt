It's because these people let tribalism dominate. I have a Shiite friend from Bangladesh. His whole family in Canada (except him) supports Ayatollah Khamanei and goes to a mosque that secretly preaches anti-semitism. They think criticism against Iran is fake and that Jews are evil.
I hear my fellow Americans HATING on Muslims. Like guys.... You don't hate the people, you hate the terrorists and the terrorist sponsoring governments. But the media would have you believe everyone in the middle east wants you dead.
But looking to the point of the people above, even Russians living in the US seem to have the opinion that Ukrainians should be killed in mass and raped?
Yes and forcibly "transferring" the Ukranian workers to Russia is kidnapping and yet another war crime committed by Russia.
"Vladimir Putin in October ordered Russia to formally seize the plant and transfer Ukrainian staff to a Russian entity. Kyiv says the transfer of assets amounts to theft.".
Came here to say this. Either this is pure fear mongering as usual and we could theoretically ignore it, or this is a blatant threat.
Yeah, and I genuinely can not for the life of me understand this. Either you are hoping of intentionally and consistently missing and thus only stoking fear, or you are actually aiming for it.
