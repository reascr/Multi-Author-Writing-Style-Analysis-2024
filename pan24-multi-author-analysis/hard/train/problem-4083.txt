Random thought: Can we have a primary for the VP? Biden gets the job done, but recently voted on confidence in his 'replacement' could make the age thing less concerning.
I remember when Biden was elected nobody assumed he'd run for a second term. Most folks I knew expected Dems to use his first term preparing a candidate to take the party and country from there. But national Dems have failed to do this, just like they've failed to build up their ranks on state levels like in Florida. It's not a forward looking strategy and risks giving up the small gains Dems have made up to Republicans.
See that's interesting because it almost sounds like youre saying that the problem is a candidate that meets those criteria doesn't exist or hasn't tried to run. But where do you think party candidates come from? They don't just appear out of thin air. Parties are supposed to vet, recruit, and build up future candidates. It feels like a lot of Democratic voters have given up on assigning any responsibility to the party in favor of blaming magical candidates not just appearing, or blaming masses of unorganized voters not voting a certain way.
That's exactly what I was referring to here. Rather than holding the party accountable for recruiting, vetting, promoting, and building up their slate of candidates, you'd much rather blame unorganized masses of voters for voting a certain way.
The only people I've encout weed who feel like this are the same people who didn't vote last election, so they can say whatever they want, they don't vote regardless of how fire the situation is.
