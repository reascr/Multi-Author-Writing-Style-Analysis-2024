There’s a legendary story about the SR71 blackbird requesting a 60,000 ft flight path. Purportedly flight control said “sure, if you can get up to 60,000 feet you can have it.” The SR71 military sources plane, which cruises at 75-85,000 ft said “roger that, Descending to 60,000 feet”.
For high altitude operations above 60,000' I'm not sure, as that's no longer considered controlled airspace. It seems like it would be a good idea to at least tell them about it, though.
Problem with that idea is that Class A is worldwide, so you'd still need to cross through it even if the airspace above it is uncontrolled. That being said the FAA only controls the airspace that belongs to the US.
If you're in controlled airspace, absolutely. The one flying at 40,000' especially, as that's where jetliners fly and is squarely within Class A. (So was the Chinese balloon but just barely...Class A ends at 60,000').
It's a Chinese spy balloon. It's not a Chinese spy balloon. They're balloons. They're not balloons. They're big as a bus. They're about the same size as a car. We are getting the wreckage. We are not able to find the wreckage. Norad has been monitoring them the whole time. They didn't monitor them. They know what they are. They don't know what they are.
