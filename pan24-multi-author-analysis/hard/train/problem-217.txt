Stopping (delaying) the event in which the new president is confirmed by illegally storming the place that happens, while actively searching for members of Congress comes pretty close.
If you think the events of Jan 6 didn't endanger the very fabric of American democracy then you need to take another look at it.
And lets take the Jan 6 scenario to its extreme - lets say they isolated and murdered a bunch of Democratic politicians. What then? They just... hand the keys to the nation to a bunch of dumb rubes? No, they'd have eventually been swarmed by heavily armed military and killed by the dozens and the survivors would all be awaiting life sentences in supermax. Actually, in this scenario the liberals of r/politics might have finally gotten their dream realized - Trump in prison.
My dude, they have guns. We're not talking about those few isolated cops that got beaten, I am talking about a literal coup in which you'd have to defeat an actual organized police or military force there to stop it.
The worst coup attempt in written history was the Beer Hall Putsch, where the crowd was stopped by over a hundred police officers before it could get off the ground.
