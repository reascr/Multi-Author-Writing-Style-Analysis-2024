Call me crazy, but I'm starting to think Republicans running on "the election was stolen" and "early/mail voting is insecure and we should discourage our voters from doing it" wasn't exactly a great way to inspire confidence in their voters to vote.
But a very, very slim margin of a Republican House majority (218 or 219) with the constant infighting and having a minority party of Democrats being large enough to constantly breathe down their collective necks sounds like a schadenfreude inducing consolation prize.
Don’t really get the doom and gloom over losing the House as winning it was always a stretch, I mean it’s frustrating that we were so close (big ups to my dumbass local Party) but still :T.
If/when the House is called for the GOP (in 3 fucking years at this rate), it's going to be the biggest wet fart of a victory for them hahaha.
If every race was called with the vote margins they have right now, Republicans would win the House, but with only 221 seats. Not only is that a far cry from the 240+ seats that were predicted, but a razor-thin lead of 3 seats wouldn't be hard to split on some votes.
If they shift focus to working behind the scenes, they could help bring about making their states, and other purple states, more blue than they have been in decades.
