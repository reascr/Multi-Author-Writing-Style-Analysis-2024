It would have had to come from a private seller. Because of the time and expense, it's not something you just pick up, and temples have very specific rules for when, why, and to whom a Torah can be sold. You couldn't even get one that was irreparably damaged, as those get buried.
I would add that the person who was planning the demonstration is yet another idiot who doesn't understand that Judaism and Israel are two different things. A protest against Israel would call for the burning of an Israeli flag, not a Jewish Torah.
At least the Torah and bible burning would have been about making a point regarding free expression. The Quran burning was just some tool expressing his hatred for Islam.
In that parallel, how was burning a Quran anti-Turkey? If it wasn’t, what reason could you attach to it other than that it was a public display of hate and islamophobia?
The amount of hypocrites in this thread is amazing a few days ago you were all for burning the koran “it’s just a book and part of free speech” now you view this as a hate crime.
I said you could legally burn a Quran (and should legally be able to), but you're an arsehole if you do it with the specific intent of hurting other people's feelings.
