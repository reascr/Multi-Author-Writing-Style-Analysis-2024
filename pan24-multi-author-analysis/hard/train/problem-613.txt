Putin's pre-war speeches revealed that he considers all of Ukraine to be an illegitimate state that was unfairly carved out of Russia. He was not just talking about Donbas and Crimea.
Russia has been somewhat effective in misleading the West into thinking that the conquest is only about Donbas and Crimea. Meanwhile Russian officials all the way up to Putin himself have been hinting or outright stating that the war is about annexing all of Ukraine.
A lot of people had quibbles with your comment, but none of them pointed out that "regime change", by assassination, is exactly what Russia has been trying to do to Ukraine.
Ukraine says they won't negotiate in Putin, but if pigs fly and Putin one day just says "fuck it, we'll rolling back to 1990s borders", I'm fairly certain the Ukrainians will start to talk. Ultimately they care more about making themselves whole than replacing Putin, especially since there's no guarantee any Putin replacement won't be even worse.
There is some argument that if Putin is replaced during this, rather than just die and be replaced, its because of the war in some capacity, so his successor, evil or not, may want to cut this off and just go back to ruling Russia with an iron fist.
