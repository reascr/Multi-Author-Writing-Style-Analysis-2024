I see it all the time. The saddest are the ones who turn republican bc they think it will help them become wealthy. WRONG. Dumb wannabees.
The stupidest people are the smartest people. Their vessel to store stupidity and ego is just that much larger than the average mere mortal.
Drumphf only releases the 1 in 7ish years he actually turns a profit. Dems only want the IRS to turn over the records of the 6 in 7 years he’s investing CapEx, aka losing. To mock him for being a failed business man.
But I do enjoy the left/right conniptions over their near deity like characters. So bizarre, and entertaining.
Na, not a Trump fan. Just don’t waste my life consumed over him either. Or Elon Musk for that matter.
Well, i will be happy with the excitement regardless of what happens. if by forcing the IRS to reveal the Covfefe Monster’s tax records ends with the left finally destroying him, or just turns out to be Trump playing them for fools yet again, epic salt will flow. It will be an auspicious event no matter how it plays out.
