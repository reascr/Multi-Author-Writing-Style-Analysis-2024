Weird to think there will eventually be a time where only 1 person in NZ is left legally allowed to buy cigarettes, even if only for a short while lol.
By banning cigarette sales to people born after a certain year, do you really think that will somehow make more people smoke? Well I guess you obviously think that, but like I said, if you took 3 seconds to google anything about it you would know it has done the opposite. Less people are starting to smoke directly because of these measures.
Because of previous measures already taken very few people still smoke. They are already taxed through the roof and a pack of 30 costs $40/pack. Young people almost exclusively vape now anyways. If you smoke now you can continue to smoke.
And if you smoke outside and dont blow it directly on someone (who the fk does that?), how are u affected?
If so you could argue that all the fatties spew out more exhaust gases due to the increased weight that need to be pushed around by engines (weather we talking jet, mc or cars).
