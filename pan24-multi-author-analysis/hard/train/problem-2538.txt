One of the biggest wins in the debates for Pavel was Babis saying he would not support Czech military assistance to fellow NATO allies despite Article 5, instead opting to say he'd try dialogue and negotiations if an ally were to be invaded. Meanwhile Pavel is literally the former Chair of the NATO military committee, the most senior military position in NATO.
He was also the Chairman of the NATO Military Committee until 2018 when he instead went into politics. So him being Pro Nato also isn't exactly a surprise.
The fact that the president elect is pro-west, pro-EU, pro-NATO is notable and should not be taken for granted.
It's not automatic. There are still people who think Czechia (and other countries) should orient themselves to the east instead, to Russia and China. The still current Czech president was like that at times.
The Czech presidency has very few powers. It’s a ceremonial position (and yet one that tends to get filled by embarrassing people).
No. Babiš has framed Pavel as a warmonger (going so far as to send out fake texts from Pavel telling the recipient that they have been mobilized), but it’s all bluster.
The difference is that Pavel expressed regret for being in the communist party and atoned with three decades of distinguished NATO service.
