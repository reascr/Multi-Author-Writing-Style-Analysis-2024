Other replies are missing the point her and remarking about his lies - but like even the stuff this guy has been confirm to have been involved in is a pretty wild life.
Like, as far as we're aware right now, he's lived in two countries, lived under several assumed names, married a woman while having a consensual/problematic relationship with another man, scammed people on GoFundMe, and then ran for congress and won.
He does exist and word is that he’s the greatest Democrat secret operative that has ever existed… when everything else is a lie who’s to say he’ll vote the way McCarthy thinks he’s supposed to? Or at least that’s what I’ve heard… probably worth spreading around….
It was never investigated because it did precisely what it was meant to do. Make everyone stop listening to a black man talk about how the Republican Party always managed to say crazy shit to make people stop listening to actual problems. It could not have been more Pavlovian if it tried, Richmond was literally saying not two seconds before how the public would drop anything if republicans said something bat shit crazy enough and sure enough…. Nestor.
Google Nestor Gaetz not just Nestor. It’s a very weird story and my money is on Nestor being Matt’s biological son that he had with Nestor’s supposed sister when she was a teenager.
