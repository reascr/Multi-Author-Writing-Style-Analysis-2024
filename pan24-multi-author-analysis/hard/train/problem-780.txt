Crime history is a no no. We have this principle that when you have served time for a crime your debt to society is paid. Normal people will never get to see those reccords.
Extended police report is needed when you apply for certain jobs though, you have to give a report that the police vouche for you. (So sex offenders wont get to work in a school for instance).
Does that happen with sex offenders, who are already public knowledge? I've never heard of it being an issue, so I can't see why it would be a concern here either.
Granted, the number of false convictions will never be zero. But this is not just based on hearsay or accusations that people would be on this list. It would be people convicted, which is famously difficult to do with regards to domestic violence specifically (murder probably a little easier to convict).
I think even with first degree murder (for example a person planning and killing their serial abuser) there are instances where a person can be reformed or released safely back into society without risk of reoffending.
While I agree there are absolutely people who can’t be reformed, or who have committed such serious crimes you can never trust them to be reformed, killing a person itself doesn’t make someone unreformable.
BUT if someone has been found guilty of a crime by the justice system, and has served its sentence, that person then should be considered pardoned and reformed in the eyes of society (not those of the victims, mind you) and so it feels morally wrong to consider them a lot more dangerous than average citizien when they might have genuinely repented.
so i think this disclosure could work but it has to be done carefully... last thing we need is a public list of targets for mob vigilantes.
