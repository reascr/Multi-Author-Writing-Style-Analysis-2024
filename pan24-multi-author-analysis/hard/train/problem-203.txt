Hopefully, this becomes a thing in California. I see so many job postings without salaries, and the ones without any listing always have the shittiest offers and insane requirements for candidates.
If theyâ€™re hiring three different positions with three different skill or experience requirements and three different salary ranges then they should just fucking put up three different job postings.
For example, you've got a company hiring software developers with multiple positions open across multiple teams, and they're open to applicants of multiple skill levels. A senior developer might command the $180k, a mid-level might warrant $120k, and a junior might be worth $70k or $80k.
Not the person you were replying to, but: because it's beneficial and the states have refused to act. Same reason we need a federal minimum wage, same reason we need federal overtime standards, etc.
That's assuming they need 3 engineers. It's entirely plausible that there's room for $180k in the budget, and they're casting out the net to see whether it's more valuable to bring on a couple of juniors or to just hire a strong senior. It might even be that different teams within the department are at different places, and team X can't afford to babysit juniors, but team Y can, and team Z could use a little more experienced help.
