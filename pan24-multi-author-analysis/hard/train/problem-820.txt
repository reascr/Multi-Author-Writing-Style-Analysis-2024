Rosa Ortega cast several regular ballots after incorrectly (fraudulently) certifying that she was eligible to do so.
I personally don't believe that either of these cases warrant prison time, but there's a pretty significant difference in the two. Provisional ballots literally exist for these edge cases where validity or whatever is in question. You take the provisional ballot and, if after extra scrutiny it checks out, it's added to the tally.
I got to say this every time I see this mentioned, but when he did that, he was talking about provisional ballots. Wherein someone who already sent in a mail-in ballot can go to the polls on election day and vote "again" just to make sure that they're counted since mail-ins can be rejected based on certain criteria not being met.
Just to be clear though, voting by mail and then voting again with a provisional ballot is not what provisional ballots are for, and is not suggested officially. That's just not what a provisional ballot is for. You don't vote twice, period.
