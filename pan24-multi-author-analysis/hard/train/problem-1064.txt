If you lived here you would know that the tv ad campaign mentioned only a "high compacity" magazines and said absolutely nothing about law enforcement getting the final say on who could and could not own a firearm.
I'm well aware, but I still think that many ardent gun control supporters would still have voted for it knowing that it would effectively ban gun sales in OR for the foreseeable future because they see that as a good thing.
I would like to believe you, but I don't have confidence that many gun control supporters wouldn't view the effective ban on gun sales as a feature of the law, not a bug.
Itâ€™s a distributed database that allows for the government to track a specific firearm, but prevents it from pulling up a list of people who own a specific type of firearm. They can, with some work, take a firearm that was recovered from a crime scene and trace that back to the person who purchased it from the store. But if the government were to ban, say, assault weapons, it would be infeasible to pull up a list of AR-15 owners and go knocking on doors.
It passed by a very narrow margin and it was not well-understood that the police could unilaterally bar an individual from owning guns (or delay issuing permits). The police bureau is extremely unpopular in Portland and if people here had been made better aware of that fact it absolutely would have been enough to tilt the scales.
