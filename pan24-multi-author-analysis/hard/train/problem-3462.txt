Videos of black people getting arrested for voting even though they were told they were legally allowed to vote.
Who would want to take the chance of voting if you'll get arrested, EVEN IF YOU WERE TOLD YOU COULD LEGALLY VOTE.
Yep, and as I said in my OP, they were told they could legally vote by the State of Florida. That's why the police were apologetic and the charges were dismissed in court. This may very well have been a publicity stunt to put a seed of doubt in other voters' minds that even though they may believe they could vote, they could very well be arrested anyway.
Its like people have totally forgotten Florida is famous for vote rigging for Republicans because they are terrified of being labeled as 'election deniers".
Otherwise it's too easy for the people to grt siscouraged by the endless DeSantis ads and just feel defeated before election even arrives.
It's closer than it seems... the Dem organization in FL is terrible. Put legal weed and abortion access on the ballot and way more people would show up.
