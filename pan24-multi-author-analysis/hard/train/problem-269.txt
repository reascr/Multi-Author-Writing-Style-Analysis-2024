I’d always respect someone’s wishes but as a parent myself who lost a child to leukaemia, does it really fucking matter who’s blood it was? If it might help your child, never mind save them there’s just no question as to accepting it.
This is something I’ll never understand, covid & vaccines aside; how a parent could refuse help for their child.
They raise a good point, the parents are doing this because they believe (wrongly) that a vaccine will harm their child.
The issue is that they likely fully agree with you there, it's just their understanding of vaccines is so misinformed they see "vaccinated blood" as not meeting that criteria.
The parents believed the use of vaccinated blood would cause further heart problems for their child, and so they have a plausible best interest argument even if based on false information.
The health authorities rejected the request to use volunteered unvaccinated blood on the grounds that it adds extra complication to the process, would not be as strictly quality controlled and there is no evidence to suggest vaccinated blood would have any adverse effect on the child. The court agreed with these reasons and concluded going with the blood service to be in the best interests of the child.
No, because the parents weren't denying care, they were demanding the use of unvaccinated blood from volunteers the parents had solicited.
