Some guy saved the lives of some kids from the war machine he's part of only for them to be kidnapped by said war machine. This is not a feel good story.
But that's just a truism relevant to many wars. However, if and when a "good" deed is carried out by the invading army and is celebrated by agents of the war machine, it's just perverted propaganda.
There's a time and a place for all of that. But if you find yourself looking Russian propaganda, its probably not the best time to say "hey yeah that's a good point".
This will be an unpopular opinion, but I’m sure that there are Russians who don’t approve of the war, so they spend their time helping as much as they can. Maybe this yuri guy is one of those people.
If you bothered to look at my post history you’d see most of my posts are overwhelmingly pro Ukraine and anti Russia, so I’m not saying this at all from a pro Russian stance. I fucking hate Putin. But does that mean every single Russian is committing genocide? There is not one Russian who, in the constraints of what they’re allowed to do by their psychopath government, actually tries to help these kids? Sorry, I have too much faith in humanity to believe that every single Russian is evil, just because that’s the popular way to think in the Reddit hive mind. Life is not always black or white.
If any of you all read my post history you’d see how pro Ukraine I am, but go ahead keep downvoting me for daring to humanize Russians that never asked for their psychopath dictator to invade a neighboring country. Real life isn’t black and white.
