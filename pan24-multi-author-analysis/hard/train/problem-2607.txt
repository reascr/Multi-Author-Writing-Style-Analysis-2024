But there is no solution. You can't process the trash fast enough to even slow down its accumulation. Obviously there is no capacity to move the trash away or process them. You can try to move people away but I doubt there is the capacity to do so right now.
So basically everyone will just watch the disaster unfold with fascination, rant a lot and secretly relief that we are not over there (except those affected).
what climate challenge? The trash mountain is killing people a lot faster than how it affects climate change. The climate challenge is a lot less relevant than those who are being poisoned right now.
Listen climate change is bad, India will be hit hard, there will be heat problems. But this is just insane nonsense.
Also I think that the 'sexiest' solution to world leaders with huge populations having to immigrate is fixing that global population decline issue. Whatever country takes in the most immigrants in the next 50 years will punch waaaay above its weight as every other nations population declines faster and harder.
