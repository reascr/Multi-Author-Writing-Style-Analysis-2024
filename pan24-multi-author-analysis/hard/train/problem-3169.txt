Judging by how these school board meetings turn into violent shouting matches where Christian nationalists yell their absurd beliefs to the world, nobody. Most sane people want to stay away to avoid what happened in Tennessee.
It's amazing to me how the teenagers are the ones acting more mature than adults lately, especially with right-wing parents. While I hate to pit generation against generation, Gen-Z is really among the most empathetic group I've ever seen, and I'm really proud of them. I hope they don't change that, because the adults currently need to learn from their example.
Christian nationalism is a drug worse than heroin. Apparently, being friends with LGBTQIA+ people brings about the destruction of the United States? How? What are LGBTQIA+ people doing? What, we are melting the ice caps in Antarctica or something?!
Yow. That's . . . depressingly unsurprising. What a paragon of Republican virtue. I see, though, that he did not win the election outright and then dropped out in favor of Jarom Wagoner (which is about as Mormon a name as I have ever heard). I wonder if some other skeletons were getting ready to tumble out of the closet? Best of luck out there.
