No, he will die a quick death from a bomb getting dropped on his head. It's the innocent people that will really feel it when and if an all-out invasion happens. History repeats itself and the US will be forgiven by everyone and the same thing will happen all over again, to the next enemy.
You're not wrong about the innocent people feeling the consequences but where you lose me is by saying "the US will be forgiven and move to the next enemy. It's just like the Korean War all over again".
Yes I saw a survey that showed 90% or so of Koreans like the US. I can't speak for every Korean because we definitely have groups in the minority that hate US soldiers and the crimes they commit in SK but almost everyone I know is thankful that the US helped save SK from communism.
I'm Korean and the vast majority of us are happy and thankful for the US because they saved us from the horrible fate that innocent North Koreans face daily. Hopefully if the US can one day topple North Korea we can reunite and give North Koreans a better future.
The USA could destroy North Korea but it doesn't mean it'll be a happy ending. North Korea will destroy Seoul in the process, it can lead to escalation with China, and even 1 nuke hitting us can affect us economically or escalate everything to something worse. Nothing is in a vacuum when it comes to war.
