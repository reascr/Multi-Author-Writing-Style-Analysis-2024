I get the feeling it's gonna be a few years before we see another Ace Combat with properly named MiG and Sukhoi jets, doubt they'll be as willing to let them license their planes for a while after this war.
Act 1: Pilot in small country flying a MiG-29 becomes an ace on the first day of an invasion by a country that definitely isn't Russia but is flying a bunch of Sukhois. Gets the callsign "Ghost". Ghost fights valiantly, but loses the rest of his squad over the course of a few missions. On the last mission of Act 1 his airbase gets destroyed by cruise missiles and he's forced to land in a neighboring country that definitely isn't Poland.
Act 3: Usea finally enters the war and they bring Ghost over from not-Poland to be their experienced spearhead. You finally get to use gigachad American fighters like the F-22. Theres a mission where you blow up this big important bridge.
Act 2: Not-Poland drafts Ghost into their air force right as they enter the war. Ghost then flies a bunch of European fighters like the Mirage and Eurofighters. Meanwhile not-Poland tries to get Usea (not-America) to enter the war, but they're hesitant. During this phase you sink their flagship, not-the-Moskva. Also a mission supporting MLRS.
Iâ€™d be surprised if they actually had to pay for a license. Russia probably saw it as a propaganda opportunity and just insisted that their jets be playable and not shit.
