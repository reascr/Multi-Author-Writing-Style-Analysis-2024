No. The authority of the executive to discharge this debt is rock solid, regardless of what Pelosi, the Republicans, or Biden himself has said. The current lawsuits- and any that would arise from completely cancelling and discharging student loan debt- have no standing at all. The correct move would have been to cancel it all, effective immediately, and then tell the courts to come and collect if they want my $20k back.
They don't though, and just because you and a few other people say so in bad faith doesn't make it so.
it's not an EO, it's using executive authority as granted by the HEROES act that allows the Secretary of Education to waive debt during wars or national emregencies (like global pandemics).
No it isn't. Piecemeal cancelling and then stopping the process for groundless judicial stays is not "cancelling it outright." If Trump's judges are illegitimate so are their rulings.
We can say judges are illegitimate all day long but they are ruling from a platform of legitimacy. And the best way to change that is through congress chambers.
