Why stop there? Why not guarantee every working American 7 paid sick days per year. Since we are gonna fix our health, let's also restructure Amercan healthcare so when you get sick, it doesn't ruin you financially.
I agree with you 100%. They are fucked up. The worst part is the people we elect to speak for us, to protect us, and to make the laws we want don't do any of those things. They cave to corporate pressure, lobbyist, and foreign money. Most of our elected officials get into politics because it is guaranteed to make you stinking rich! There is not one poor politician that I can think of. They make policy that makes them rich. Insider trading...the list goes on and on. It is sad.
In the USA, you generally just don't get paid at all while you are away sick. The Dr's note will excuse you but you won't be paid. Some companies offer paid sick days as a benefit. But if you have 5 sick days you stop getting paid after the 5th day absent.
So would that mean that those are all unpaid days when they remove themselves for illness? If they're so short-staffed why would they want someone to take an unpaid day off now, and then take an additional paid day off in the future, instead of having them just take the day then?
By having it unpaid, they're hoping to push people into not taking the day at all, and only ever using the scheduled ones. They'd rather have the people come into work sick.
They have paid sick leave though, right? They just have to use their other PTO to take it, which is how every other jobs I've had is.
