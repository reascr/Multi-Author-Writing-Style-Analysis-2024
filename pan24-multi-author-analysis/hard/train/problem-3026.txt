I live in Shanghai a few streets from that area. It's getting pretty wild in the WeChat groups right now, then things go silent.
My friend showed up to our games session last night having to walk through it from home and had some bloody hands and knee from being knocked down. Another friend saw some police brutality. Lots of interesting videos being shared of people chanting, yelling, and lots of police in force.
I have never in my life seen people in china pull people from police and shout about having the CCP step down.
There were a few hundred protestors in Shanghai that had anti-CCP chants, the rest of the overwhelming majority is protesting against the Covid measures and not against the CCP.
People are protesting in China but the overwhelming majority are protesting the Covid measures not the CCP. That's a fact.
So yeah. It's not really the most observant question to ask why the Chinese almost never protest, and don't feel much incentive to protest. There are better ways to support the Chinese people than shaming them for not standing up for themselves given the immense risk and faint, barely-there reward.
