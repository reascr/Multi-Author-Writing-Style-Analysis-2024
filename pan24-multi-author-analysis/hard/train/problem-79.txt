And will talk about publicly. If there were some that the perpetrators don’t know that MI5 are aware of, they wouldn’t necessarily confirm they knew about it.
I'm fairly confident that if you thought of that, MI5 have also thought of that and made a calculated announcement for reasons they'll likely not reveal. Not saying you're not a smart person, but I think MI5 got this covered and know a thing or two about this kinda stuff.
Seems kind of naive to me to think that MI5 or the FBI or various police departments, etc., work with journalists without any sense of oversight into what gets published and how.
This sort of phrasing is IMO really irresponsible and buries a lot of the nuance in the West's relationship with the Middle East region and their general sense of sovereignty. They are paranoid and untrusting, sure, and this can be deeply problematic, but let's be fucking honest the West has done less than nothing to engender a sense of trust from leaders in the Middle East. Even our closest allies are constantly fucking around and hoping they can maybe skip finding out.
