I see one force content with us being near the bottom in nearly every OECD ranking, and another that actually wants to figure out ways to move forward in a way that can actually help the average person out once in a while. Yes, they both take corporate money, but, hey, SCOTUS decided they're people too.
Some conspiracy theorists call the Dems and Republicans the "uniparty," because they're both backed by corporate interests, so they're both "the same" (but don't forget to vote Republican anyway!). I disagree.
There were never any significant investigations or punishments, and Obama's people justified it as wanting to "unify, not divide" people more and that they were "focused on moving forward, not looking back" and similar wishy-washy phrases.
I'm a leftist, but I love my country, or at least the values that it was meant to stand for. I just want to move forward. And I want to hold the far-right accountable for some of the things they've done in recent years.
Exactly, they need to be held accountable for their crimes and trying to overthrow a fair election. It literally calls into question the rule of law in the country if the main perpetrators aren’t held responsible. There’s no working nicely and in a bipartisan way with fascists.
