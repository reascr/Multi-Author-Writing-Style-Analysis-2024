Even among super misogynistic men who do rape and abuse women, you’ll notice that 99% of the time they still only target women with no social power. Take these men to the US and have some hot woman walk down the street in front of them butt naked in front of a bunch of armed police men. Suddenly, they aren’t going to attack her, so wow, I guess they’ve magically developed superhuman self control they just inherently didn’t have before!
Like if tomorrow something wild happened and suddenly all of say Iceland developed all of these crazy laws about women having to be completely covered up at all times and not even really allowed to be anywhere in public, and you somehow enforced that, little would change. Abuse and rape of women would barely increase, not even after decades of that, because fundamentally they do not have the same concept of gender as these places do.
Treating women horribly, physically or mentally, causes so many problems for both boys and girls in the next generation.
I feel so sorry for the women and children; especially those who were able to receive some education.
In addition, the lack of education for women has serious consequences for the health and well-being of the entire population. As I mentioned earlier, without education and access to healthcare, women are unable to receive the medical care that they need. This can have serious consequences for their health and the health of their families.
