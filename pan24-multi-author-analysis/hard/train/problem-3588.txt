Pro tip. Use textise.net to view most paywalled articles. But, it depends on how the page is coded. Don't expect WSJ or Bloomberg to work with this trick. But for most it does.
You're right. It's a garbage article from a garbage websight. But there are probably hundreds of thousands of people here who hate this "socialist" entitlement. And others who, like you, agree the problem needed fixing, but disagree this was an ideal way to do it.... ignoring the stupid argument about "socialism." Most important, the one-time loan forgiveness probably does absolutely nothing about the continued astronomical cost of higher education.
