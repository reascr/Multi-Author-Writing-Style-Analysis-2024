She was at 34K earlier today (maybe higher, I caught the Pima, Pinal, and Maricopa drops all at once, and if Pima came first that would have put her further ahead before Pinal and Maricopa chipped away). The big drop is always Maricopa which went 55-45 in Lake's favor this time, so it is definitely accurate to say Lake cut into Hobbs's lead.
In Maricopa County, all ballots printed and filled out on Election Day were counted by 2AM Wednesday morning (aside from about 17K with printer issues, 12K of which were counted in Friday or Saturday's batch). And most of the mail-ins received by the Saturday before Election Day were signature-verified and counted prior to Election Day, and released in the initial batch. So we're left with a gray zone of early ballots received by mail or dropped off between Saturday and Tuesday, and those are being counted in the order received (i.e., ballots dropped off at precincts closer to downtown were counted first, and suburban/exurban fringes of the metro area further from the counting center are getting processed last).
The ballots remaining are mail in ballots that people walked to the voting place on election day, but my worry is that Lake told her voters to do that (only vote same day and donâ€™t mail your ballots).
I believe everything being counted now were from voters who dropped off early/mail ballots on Election Day. Take from that what you will - the fact that this population used mail ballots suggests one thing about the partisan slant, and showing up day-of to drop them off suggests the opposite.
Because these ballots can be dropped off anywhere in the county, there is no way of estimating how the vote will skew.
The whatever reason is that the Rumble morons were telling viewers that the only way to ensure your vote would be counted was to drop it off on election day. At least that's what I was told by my MAGA family.
