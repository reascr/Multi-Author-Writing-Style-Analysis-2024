Ukraine back in 2014 was not the same it is now. Nobody would have given them anywhere close to the weapons they were given now.
The M1 has an older gun that the modern Leopards. The M1 is still using the licensed gun which is the 120mm L44. The modern Leopard 2 starting with the A6 variant use the 120mm L55.
Yeah, it's literally a Leopard 2A4 hull, just with a new turret housing a 130mm main gun instead of the usual 120mm one.
Again, instead of comparing the M1 to the T-72, compare it to the Leopard 2, which has the same gun. Exact same gun. In fact the gun was developed for the Leopard 2, and later adapted to the M1.
The Leopard 2 has the same gun. They invented that gun. If the Leopard 2 is less hampered by logistics and can also kill T-72s, and it was designed with them in mind, perhaps its a better tank.
Bigger question is not T-72 vs M1, but what is so greater about the Abrams that its worth the logistics burden including fuel and not being able to cross real bridges in the most likely actual battlefields over the Leopard 2?
The next question goes: How much better is an M1 Abrams vs a Leopard 2 that justifies that added logistics burden that will exist for any army that fields any tanks or any vehicles.
Military vehicles are supposed to be designed with logistics in mind, a more expensive vehicle to maintain, takes away from other parts of the military.
