It’s not debatable when you open the “whole world,” up for debate. But it’s definitely true, in the US, that legal, and safe abortions lead to lower crime.
While I agree some of the issues will still be there, abortion is still something that the majority of Americans want to be available. That won't go away in 2 years and Gen Z is now a BIG factor. Take into account that boomers are dying and the younger generations are heavily leaning to the left, the onus is going to be on the republicans to come up with something more creative to act offended toward. The republicans are becoming more and more unpalatable to the increasing majority of Americans. People tend to react very strongly to having their rights taken away from them and their kids. Gen Z seems to be thinking long term and has dug in on voting for their rights instead of cultural issues used to distract at the very most.
The right is getting more and more desperate. Americans don't want to be ruled by authoritarians, christians, old white men who are out of touch or anyone who is as extreme as any MAGA candidate. It's encouraging to know that the GQP is being crushed and rejected by most facets of society. The majority isn't buying what the republicans are selling. So, either the republicans change their ways or they'll be extinct in the next few election cycles.
