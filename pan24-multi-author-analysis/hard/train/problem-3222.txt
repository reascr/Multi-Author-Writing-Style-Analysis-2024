Everyone is getting confused here. The reason why SpaceX is baulking and limiting use here is due to one very specific example. See, Ukraine has directly integrated SpaceX Starlink terminals into the suicide drone itself. The Starlink terminal is part of the weapon, which in this case is effectively a tv guided torpedo.
The communications network of Starlink allows these tv guided torpedos to have infinite range, limited only by how much fuel can be loaded into the drone. If they were to use solar arrays to provide power for propulsion then even that restriction can be removed.
This changes things for SpaceX considerably. It turns them from just a communications provider (which they have no objections about since they also provide US military with communication services), into a weapons manufacturer. A very different deal for SpaceX. The other uses for Starlink is fine. They have objections about Starlink being made into part of a weapon.
(You're saying Starlink doesn't want to be held under some US weapons law... But the US government might want them to be anyway)?
