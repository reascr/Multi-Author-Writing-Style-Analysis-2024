We're doomed. reactionaries just want to use authoritarian police to drag the US back to 1950? 1850? and the centrist view from nowhere media are just parroting their talking points and manifesting a crime wave into existence.
I've tried explaining how the media (especially right wing media like FOX News) runs "crime stories" because they generate more views, but my father remains unconvinced because FOX told him that crime is way way up.
He's been watching FOX News for over 20 years, but the fear that right wing media has instilled in him over the past decade is on a whole different level.
My parents live on Long Island and watch FOX News. My father worked in NYC for decades. Now, he is always telling me that he wants to go back into NYC, but he's afraid of the roving gangs of teenagers who like to punch elderly people for no reason and the huge numbers of criminals who mug and/or kill anyone who enters the city.
I've tried to fight against the misinformation, but my father's dead set in his views now. FOX played up the scare tactics so much that my father is convinced that it's impossible to be in NYC and not be a victim of some violent crime.
Sadly, this works. My father is absolutely convinced that crime is running rampant everywhere. He thinks that this is especially true in cities, but even in his suburban neighborhood he thinks he's taking his life in his hands when he goes to the store to get groceries.
