The real problem is the Russians who leave, because 100,000 or even if it ends up being 300,000 be as horrible as it sounds but if millions of young men leave to escape the draft it will be the nail in the coffin.
Their population had an even worse decline than russia and they were also poorer and similar in corruption ranking, i do hope the war purged the corruption and that it will give the Ukrainian people the spirit and motivation to work hard& make children after the war is finished (as Afghanistan&vietnam prove no matter how many how many people die in war if you make enough children your population would still double).
if we are strictly talking about casualties the problem is much worse for Ukraine whose population is 3 times smaller with even lower birth rate and similar military casualties and tens of thousands of civilian casualties so even if all the 7 million refugees return to the coumtry(a lot already did) they would still have a huge population problem that most people seem to ignore.
I was saying i hoped the war purged the corruption in the Ukrainian ranks , it was in favour of Ukraine ...
So yeah, Putin's actions are viewed as justified and most people feel like they would rather die than let Ukraine win. Welcome to WW3, which is found digitally online, just like everyone predicted.
