But if DeSantis is the GOP nom, we will never hear the end of carping about Biden's age. And the Millennials and GenX-ers will be furious that the older generation will not let go. And I'm sympathetic.
I admit that Biden has accomplished a hell of a lot as President, especially given the current political atmosphere.
There's a sound argument that Biden has been more effective than Obama, who was only 47 when he took office.
I like Biden, and also he's our literal best shot at keeping the Republicans out of the White House in 2024.
The major difference about Biden's voters that I enjoy is they do not see Biden as some demigod like the GOP sees Trump as. There is no cult of personality around Biden and honestly most of voters, including me, only voted Biden because he was not Trump.
Biden has already gotten more votes than any current Democratic candidate who is younger than him, in the 2020 primaries. All the other possible's, like Governor Newsom, have flat stated they aren't running in 2024.
