This might be a hot take, but America needs a strong Republican Party to help balance the government. I left that party because of their denial of scientific facts like COVID and global warming, and refuse to ever go back. But we need more decent people like Mitt Romney in that party to help push back on the crazies.
You literally just described a Democracy. I agree with this lady. The Republicans need to change their playbook, as it has gotten out of control. There is nothing wrong with fiscally conservative Republicans that are willing to say “no” to Liberals who want to spend on every social program. We need that balance for a strong government.
Agreed. Republicans are full of shit, and have gotten worse the past 6 years. I lean liberal now, but think ACTUAL fiscal conservatives are needed for a healthy government.
I agree that we need balance, but where are the "fiscally conservative Republicans" when it comes to tax cuts for the rich, increased military spending, and other programs that Republicans traditionally favor? The national debt isn't all the fault of Liberals.
