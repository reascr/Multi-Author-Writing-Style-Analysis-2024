I think the "new solutions" for infrastructure attacks is Turkish power power plant ships that will be docked in ports and provide electricity to Ukraine. Turkey has a bunch of them and has already said they will send one. Obviously Russia won't attack a NATO ship.
Turkish ships are all over the Black Sea and Russia doesn't touch them. A Turkish civilian vessel being attacked by Russia would bring Turkey directly into the war as a full participant. There is an enormous difference between hostile forces and civilian ships.
A solar installation for a single house uses about 2-400 square feet of roof surface, and costs about twenty thousand dollars. Powering an entire city with solar requires hundreds of square miles of panels. It's really helpful for stuff like emergency lighting and keeping road signals working, but as a general purpose power supply you have to spend a lot of time and money building very big. If it was a quick solution we wouldn't still be burning coal all over the world.
