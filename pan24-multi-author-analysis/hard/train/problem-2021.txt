It will never be eradicated, but the truth of the matter is that the right-wing radicals are incapable of gaining and wielding power at this point. They blew their best shot six years ago, their coup attempt two years ago failed, their attempt to set up the next coup failed. The system held and strenhened itself and now they are forced to actually compete under it for popular support, which will remain elusive because large majorities are against them.
Just because conservatives and their radical wing is a minority and is trending even more so does not negate the fact that that they wield disproportionate power and are not afraid to use this power to hold on to that power.
I don't understand how anyone could study history and think fascism is so easily eradicated. I'm hopeful, but the right wing radicals have shown what they will do when democracy is against them.
What you're seeing is a correction of that tilt back to democracy. We are witnessing the destruction of a failed attempt at a fascist takeover, and the people and party who attempted that play failed miserably.
