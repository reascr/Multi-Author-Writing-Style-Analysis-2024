Well the people scared of hazmat suits can deal with it. Why should someone sacrifice their personal safety when it’s not causing anyone else any physical harm? There’s a pandemic, and some people don’t want to get infected, and some people who are immune compromised can’t take that chance, so if some people have a problem with that, too bad, they can mind their business.
Totally true. My brother is currently in China on a business trip, 10 days quarantine in a hotel with shitty food. If he went in with Covid, it would be so much worse.
Covid is going to get a lot worse for China for many factors. Having over 1 billion people with similar genetics (Han Chinese) is a big Achilles heel for fighting a virus.
Marek disease in factory chickens is an example of this due to narrow genetics and immune responses with 1 type of vaccine that became ineffective.
Having a populace with broad genetics like USA, Brazil, Europe, etc. Prevents ease of replication due to differing immune systems and it's response to the virus. Also having a variety of effective vaccines.
Unfortunately, the rest of the world produced, and shared among themselves, some effective vaccines. China didn’t and, in their pig-headed communist way, preferred to maintain they were fine, despite overwhelming evidence they were not, which they hid from their entire population and forced entire major cities into lockdown (except for those given the job of sanitizing runways).
It has been drilled into them since kindergarten that the West is bad so they are conflicted and ambivalent ( not to mention they are probably called upon to make regular “fill ups” at a Chinese “service station”).
