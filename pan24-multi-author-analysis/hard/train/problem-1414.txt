Russia as a single country wasn't given a seat, the USSR was. When that fell apart, Russia simply assumed the seat, they were never formally granted a permanent spot. Until now, no one bothered with it because Russia was considered a major power and of course they have nuks and are prone to tantrums. But the reality is, any country of the former USSR could have laid claim to that seat, Russia just bullied their way in because Moscow was the USSR's base of power. What really needs to be eliminated is Russia's veto power. There's no country that has abused that power more than Russia.
Russia was not the last member of the USSR. Russia declared independence from the USSR on December 12, 1991. The request to the UN for Russias seat was not presented until 24 December 1991. Russia had no standing to request make that request as there were members of the USSR up until May 1992.
Russia was not voted to take the seat. A letter was circulated with no objections. Article 27 states that â€œDecisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmativevote of nine members.
It should have been written into the charter that a Security Council vote could be overridden with a plurality of the General Assembly. Sadly, it wasn't, so we have to work within the setup we currently have. None of the countries with veto power will give them up willingly.
The veto powers belong to the US, France, UK, China and Russia. The first three all have the exact same geopolitical position and will essentially allow the US to do whatever it wants in terms of military endeavors and invasions. The US is not getting 'kicked out' of the UNSC regardless of what happens with Russia. However, the value of the council will disappear overnight as it will become just another forum for the West to impose their geopolitical will, why would any upcoming powerful country want to be involved when Western interests are the only interest that matter?
