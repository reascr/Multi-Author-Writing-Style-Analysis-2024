Im a german civil servant so not exactly fitting the bill here but close enough. NO. Most people have simply put no fucking clue what civil servants do whatsoever. Most of my job is deliberating on matters and then justifying actions to be taken by the state based upon my deliberation. In practice that means that I sit in front of a pc and look at current jurisprudence as well as writing long ass Essays. There is no point whatsoever that I need to be in an office space talking about Bobs Cats and their children that never visit. If I need to consulate a colleague I do this by the same means i did before, via Telephone. Good luck outsourcing my job to an indian Firm.
I agree that your role is difficult to outsource to India. They have a very different cultural sense. On the other hand I do wonder if your own cultural sense was informed by some years of seeing situations that you did not plan to see, but turned out to provide useful context for your current role.
It sounds like you have a job which is extremely dependent on your nation's culture in terms of what it would like to consider just judgment.
Maybe I'm just a boomer and I'm too old. If everyone hated meeting other people randomly at their company and accidentally gain some contextual understanding outside of their station then we are moving towards a workforce of very well siloed individuals working under their team silos.
