Nowadays, majority of Chinese Indonesians zoomers can't even speak a lick of Mandarin (or other dialects) and don't really participate in Chinese cultural events bar Chinese New Year, especially of those who converted to Christianity from Confucianism or Buddhism.
That's the same. Younger generations are less fluent in their Sinitic mother languages (Min (Hokkien), Chaoshan (Teochew), Hakka (Khek), just for major examples) compared to their elders. A lot of them now have their first and second language to be both Indonesian and English.
I have been visiting Indonesia almost every year over the last 15 years since my wife is Indonesian. People there don't seem to notice it but I have seen is surely but slowly turn Islamist. First time I was there the aunties and nieces were wearing dresses without sleeves or knee high skirts. Now they are all wearing headscarves and long dresses with long sleeves, even the children. No more beer in the supermarket. Many family went from never praying to 5 times a day. The people are just as friendly and nice as ever but life definitely did change and in my view not for the better.
I think there are some supermarkets in big malls that are allowed to sell beer. But anything other than that e.g. the local supermarkets in residential areas are not. Even in a big city like Surabaya where I usually visit.
I actually went to Bali a few years back and really liked the place. At the time, I could definitely see myself running a remote-first software company from there.
