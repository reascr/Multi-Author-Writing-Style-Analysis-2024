The good news is that like the A-10 would be, they haven't been particularly survivable in this conflict. At least the A-10 has a "bathtub" cockpit and redundant flight systems, not sure the Su-25 is as armored.
I think one theme we can recover from the Cold War is that the western defense contractors were phenomenal salespeople for Russian capabilities, and I thank them for that, because now everything the west has is sort of OP.
I agree with this, outside of specific operations and tactics, but I think it eventually starts adding up, and as USSR-spec kit becomes kaput, and replaced by NATO kit, eventually Ukraine is fighting with equipment specifically designed to wreck Warsaw-pact equipment that Russia is fielding.
While its true that NATO kit will surpass Russian counterparts and already has shown its value in this war, I hope no one legitimately expects 50 of any armored vehicle to turn the tide in any sudden way. I think it's mostly to set the grounds for continued support, first 50, then another 50 etc. etc.
Yeah. Russia(n Government) started a revanchist war for nothing but glory and resources. Until they stop and get the fuck out there should be no meeting in the middle on anything, no guarantees, no nothing.
