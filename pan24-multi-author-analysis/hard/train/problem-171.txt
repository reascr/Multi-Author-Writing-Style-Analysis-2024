"bans teaching anything that assumes “fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, or to members of a race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin because of their race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.”.
Especially when the law "bans teaching anything that assumes “fault, blame, or bias should be assigned to race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin, or to members of a race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin because of their race, sex, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin.”.
Not with South Carolina judges. And not when the law literally bans any acknowledgement of systemic racism. It basically makes it so they can enforce it in a systemically racist way and they can never be called on it, because doing so is itself illegal.
That is why they conveniently define racism, and define it in such a way that it is basically "anything that would make a white supremacist uncomfortable.".
