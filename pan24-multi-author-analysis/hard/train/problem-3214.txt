Fun fact: If you write that cheap ass, skinflint, phony billionaire a check for $0.18, that pathetic doofus will cash it. There is no handout too insignificant for him to turn down.
If anything, this will continue to be a bellwether of the intelligence level of people you converse with. "Oh, he's going on about Hunter Biden, that gives me at least 5 minutes to putz around on my phone while he blathers".
Leave them alone, they're done wishing they were vampires, now they wish they were were werewolves, because a werewolf can kill a vampire (did you know that?).
Yep. People need to remember that to impeach and remove someone from office, whether it's the president, a Supreme Court judge, or a member of the president's cabinet, it requires 67 Senators to vote to convict. There is zero chance that 17, and possibly 18 (depending on the GA runoff) Democratic Senators will vote to remove Biden or anyone on his cabinet, mainly because the Republicans don't have any legit reason to impeach them.
For a bill to become a law it must pass a majority in the House, then pass a 60 vote threshold to defeat a filibuster in the Senate, then must be signed into law by the president. Any legislation the GOP passes with their razor thin majority in the House won't even come up for a vote in the Senate and that will be where all their bullshit "legislation" dies.
It won't even get to the Senate, because they won't even be able to get all of their House caucus to vote for an impeachment. Republicans from blue states and close districts won't vote for that crap.
