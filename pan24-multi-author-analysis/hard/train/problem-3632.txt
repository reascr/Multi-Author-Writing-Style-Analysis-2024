I thought some of the actual hit men were publicly excited by MBS to attempt to shift blame. MBS is still fist bumping world leaders. Your point is correct either way.
You’re right! We should partner with the civilized people of Palestine, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc etc etc who elect terrorist organizations to run their countries and stone gay people to death and don’t let women go to school or drive cars and marry of children and murder women who don’t cover their heads. You know the really super civilized people of the Middle East.
The difference is Ukrainian is not run by a terrorist organization that send suicide bombers into Russia routinely and fires rockets at Russia routinely. How can you not see that? It’s actually almost funny how hard you’re stretching to paint Israel at the aggressor but it’s actually just sad.
Very messed up, it's vile what the far right of Israel and their army do to Palestinian civilians along with the astroturfing of propaganda to bury their suffering or blame them for it.
Opposing Israel's actions towards the Palestinians has fuck all to do with it being a Jewish state, and everything to do with those actions, taken by any national/ethnic/religious group towards another being wrong.
If supporting Israel didn't materially and politically benefit the West, it would be treated the same as so many states that have gone through this (The Balkans during the Yugoslavia Wars, Malaysia, Myanmar, Rwanda, the Congo, etc).
Even if it does not meet that requirement, the conditions imposed on Gaza, and the internationally acknowledged illegal seizure of Palestinian land, sounds much like the definition of ethnic cleansing:
