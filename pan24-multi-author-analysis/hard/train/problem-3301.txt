Not allowing college students to vote where they live while attending college full time, instead forcing them to return to whichever city they are from (if in state) in order to vote. This can be mitigated if states have half decent absentee voting.
Closing voting locations and consolidating into just a handful to increase the amount of time needed to vote. This also increases the amount of effort it takes since you can't just swing down to your local center/church/whatever and cast a ballot. Kentucky likes to do this shit for cities, but allow tons of centers in rural areas.
Strategically place prisons to diminish the voting power of youth/urban voters (they tend to go hand-in-hand since rural America is dying). Prisoners are counted for the purposes of district drawing and gerrymandering. Doesn't help much in state-wide races though, but does demoralize people when they see "oh we made 55% of the vote... and got 30% of the seats" like in Wisconsin.
If we can’t defeat them by making it hard for just minorities and the poor to vote, let’s just prevent everyone from voting until we are all dead.
If we start eliminating people from voting for being too young…can we also eliminate those that are too old? Older voters may be voting for things that they might not have to deal with the consequences for in the future.
Voting matters more for 16 year olds than 65 year olds. I'm tired of geriatrics making life worse for younger generations with no consequences to themselves.
