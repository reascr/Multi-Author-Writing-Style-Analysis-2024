I tried to find some background on her. She went to a small Pennsylvania college and a second (if that) tier law school. She supposedly was born in NYC. Nothing else. From some news reports she was a lawyer for some parking garages (made me think of mafia and the trash collection business) before becoming trump's lawyer. She has been identified as a "Super Lawyer" by a publication that's kind of like a paid publication of lawyer advertising.
A year or so ago I looked her up because there were some news reports of statements she made that I thought were pretty dumb, including arguing in court with the judge handling the Carroll case.
In one of trump's NY cases she submitted an affidavit asserting that after a thorough search by her there were no financial records to be found at any trump residence (including MAL) or business. This thorough search was carried out a week before the Saudis arrived at Bedminster. If she did a thorough search, that means she saw all of the classified documents at MAL.
Interesting idea. If trump sues her for the sanctions, that would trigger the malpractice insurance coverage. It wouldn't cover her liability to the court for the sanctions because, like car insurance, it's there in case you get sued.
More likely, since he and his attorney are liable jointly and severally, he'll just ignore it and leave the attorney to pay it and chase him for his portion. Then hire other lawyers to fight that suit, who if they are paid at all will be paid out of your aforementioned sucker fund.
