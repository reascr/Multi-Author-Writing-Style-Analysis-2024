apparently when he caught a felony gun charge in 2019 the DA let him plead it down to a misdemeanor + probation.
>He was charged with a felony, they reduced the charge as part of a plea deal and it was a misdemeanor for possesing a loaded firearm, part of the deal was he got to keep his firearm.
There is a link within the twitter thread that the article is about. but it is just a snip from somewhere about a plea deal for a firearms charge. I can't vouch for anything about this.
I don't pretend to know why these people do what they do. When I do see someone wearing a MAGA hat these days they're typically a senior citizen and they appear to have a permanent scowl on their face. As for the people wearing "L et's Go Brandon" clothing, they're a mix of the aforementioned MAGA hat wearers or younger "country" folk who feel like they're on a mission to piss off all the liberals. I did see a new (to me) hat recently at Walmart being worn by a younger fellow. It said "Pedophile Hunter" and below it was a rifle. I can only imagine that person is a pleasant individual.
Bullshit. I saw two last week. Although one did say "Foxtrot Juliet Bravo" instead of simply "FJB." I also saw a "L et's Go Brandon" sticker yesterday. There's still a truck driving around in my area with a large image of Trump on the driver's-side window and a picture of Clinton behind bars on the passenger window.
I'm still seeing a bunch of Trump 2024 flags and stickers. I imagine it won't be too long before they receive updated firmware and start putting up DeSantis stuff. I suspect there will be some holdouts, but in the end they will fall in line.
