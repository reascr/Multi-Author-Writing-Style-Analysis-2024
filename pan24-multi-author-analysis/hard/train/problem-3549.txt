Not recent on what? Those scams are still running and no one even bother to stop it there. You guys are the one trying to distant yourself from US, and that explains well why your Russia buddy is supporting you.
Russia betrayed pretty much all of their allies at one point or another, just look at Armenia. Ukraine was the culturally closest country to Russia and russians had no problems starting genocide there. Its very naive of India to think, that just because USSR supported them 50 years ago, Russia of today is exactly the same and just as reliable. If India gets into a war with China, Russia won't move a finger to help them.
Theres 0 chance of India selling these weapons on to russia, that doesent help their strategic goals.
Considering India's weapon exports are increasing and is about to make some Nato weapons as well. Brahmos missiles were sold to a few countries so I guess decent.
Why are you talking as if India is gonna give it to Russia? It being made for the Indian army and Russia doesn't need India to manufacture weapons for them.
