If we're going to eliminate people's jobs, there has to be a way for the people doing those jobs to be compensated and reap the benefits of technological advancement instead of only the employers.
In the short-term I think if you're an owner, if you see your competitors cutting costs dramatically by laying off workers and replacing them with robots you will do the same. Though I'm sure there will be some companies that are "proudly non-robot" in the same way there's a niche for organic food which is getting more popular every year.
Yeah, but now we have Google Gato which can do hundreds of tasks humans can do and direct other robots. It's also, and I hate to be that guy, a logical fallacy that just because a thing has happened a certain way in the past means it will happen the same way in the future. I hope you're right though.
We can hope it will. When we invented steam engines, it wasn’t as if the steam engines could create steam engines too. Sewing machines couldn’t automatically sew new sewing machines.
