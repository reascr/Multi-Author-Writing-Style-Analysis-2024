It looks like Frisch is up by 4900, with a batch of about 8000 R and 3000 D votes remaining in Mesa, which is typically heavy R. The other remaining votes don't seem to favor any candidate.
Based on that data and the current margins in each of those counties - I am calculating out of a total 36,450 approx votes to count that Frisch wins 19,246 of them to Boebert's 17,204.
They must think the margins will swing even wider for B in these counties - although 55% of the remaining 36K votes left to count come from Pueblo county where Frisch is currently ahead by a 11% margin.
I‚Äôm not sure why the New York Times analysis has the remaining votes in Pueblo County breaking for Boebert when 55% of the vote total Went to Frisch. Maybe they are using last election cycle‚Äôs percentages in their estimates? Or maybe they know something I don‚Äôt. Military vote? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Looking at the counties that still have outstanding votes, Boebert looks to be toast. At least one less qanon nut to chair committees once the dems lose the house majority.
