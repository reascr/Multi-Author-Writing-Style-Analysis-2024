It is only the ice on land that raises the level. The ice floating in the ocean when it melts will not raise the levels. Easily checked with a glass bowl a bunch of ice and a marker. The level will not change as the ice melts. Basic science.
No argument with any of that. My statement was only that floating ice when it melts will not lift the overall height of the oceans. Only ice on land that floats into the ocean.
Like others have said, we're looking at land ice here, not sea ice. Land ice makes up a big chunk of Greenland and Antarctica, and is, in fact, melting. The sea ice is also melting. Arctic sea ice is down 28% since 1979. Like you said, ice that's already in the water isn't going to cause a rise in water level when it melts, but that doesn't mean it's harmless.
You want to talk basic science? Get a glass each of room temperature salt water and fresh water, each dyed a different color. Pour the fresh into the salt. What happens? Your fresh water likely sat on top of your salt water, because salt water is denser than fresh. Now, do the same thing with a cup of fresh water close to freezing, and a second of warmer water. Your warm water likely sat on top, because cold water is denser than warm.
When ice--both land and sea--melts, it makes the ocean below less salty, therefore less dense. It also makes the polar seas warmer, because the dark seawater absorbs more heat from the sun. So that cold, salty, dense water that forms the basis of all of the ocean's circulation slowly ceases to exist. We have already noticed this starting. Changes to these currents have dramatic implications for storm patterns, hurricanes, wind currents, the distribution of marine nutrients (and therefore the abundance and distribution of fish), weather patterns, and more.
