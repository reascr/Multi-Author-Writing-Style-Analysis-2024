Wait until you hear about how the parking lot for a popular dinning destination is built over one of the original graveyards in Columbus and they are now using that area as a base for a new high rise. They are still finding bodies. Same thing happens with one of the main reservoirs north of town.
Yes, North Market. Alum Creek and Hoover are also built over lots of small towns where all they did was remove the headstones.
The school was Upper Arlinon and I thought I read that during the latest remodel, they found more graves.
Also the high school, was that the Upper Arlinon School district, or another one? With that one, they just exhumed the remains and buried them in a different cemetery with no markers.
Almost two-score graves desecrated, at least, and for what? A fucking data center? I think Microsoft of all organizations can afford to work around a small plot. The PR alone wouldâ€™ve been a great boon to them I reckon, considering how fiercely many Virginians oppose the data centers being scattered everywhere across the state. This is the sort of shit that honestly just enrages me. Makes me wish I held some sort of public office so I could actually do more than vent on Reddit.
As a native Virginian this is the sort of thing that enrages me, but particularly hurts here at home. We as a state trumpet our long history, but all too often my kinsmen forget that we have more than just white history; we have black history, indigenous history, immigrant history, and so on and so forth. All of it deserves to be protected, especially that which has for so long been neglected or concealed by our forefathers.
