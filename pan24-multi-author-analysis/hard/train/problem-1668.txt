I would say all this talk is "gaslighting" but its pointless here lmao. I know you didnt even touch on free speech btw. Good call lol.
Good. Do this more often. Leave 'em standing there like they have each other's dick in their hands. Spineless cowards. Like the lady said, they'd be on a plane to mar a lago to kiss trump's ring hand. Good for them.
Good. McConnell and McCarthy were complicit. If either one had a spine January 6th would have NEVER happened.
>Representatives of those receiving the Congressional Gold Medal decline to shake hands with Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy during a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
I applaud them for not shaking hands with McConnell and McCarthy Neither one of those trump ass kisser should have known not to be there, they and the rest who resisted to publicly denounce trump on January 6th And that py bag McCarthy is speaker of the house next year? He should automatically be disqualified for third in line to the presidency REALLY.
