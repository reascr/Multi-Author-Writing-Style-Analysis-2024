There has been too much retaliation and injustice by both sides. Someone has to break the chain. Two people get murdered, so several dozen are about to die, so more people will be murdered. The Palestinians think that the Israeli goal is to exterminate every single one of them, a belief which the Israeli government never seems to work too hard to disabuse them of.
But until they are you'll get murders, Israel needs to reign in its settlers and Palestinian terrorists can be dealt with as a separate issue then.
To push its claim on Palestinian areas and to probably eventually getting rid of any idea of a two-state solution. If Israel can take more and more of the West Bank, they can claim that the two state solution is dead cus hey look, we hold all this land now, not enough space for a Palestinian state.
Until the occupation ends Palestinians will be RIGHT to fight occupation, if you were occupied by a foreign power you'd have the right to do so to.
As far as all Palestinian leaders, and many of their people, the occupation will end when all Jews will be "Annihilated" (Real quote). It is literally written as the first thing in the Hamas covenant.
