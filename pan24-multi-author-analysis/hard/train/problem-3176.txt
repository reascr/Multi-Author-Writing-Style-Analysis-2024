Of course the politicians won't support something that they see will alienate a large portion of their voter base and may mean that they'll lose/won't gain the power to govern their country?
We're also the only country in the EU where it's not just possession that's illegal, but the use of the drugs themselves, actually just having it in your body/blood stream. So if a police officer forces you to leave a urine sample and you test positive for cannabis, then BAM! You're now a criminal and will have a hard time finding a job in many many different industries.
It's 100% the case where I'm from. The older generations 45-50+ have been indoctrinated into the belief that cannabis and all other drugs are a huge moral failing and something you should be ashamed of using, and they also seem to think that cannabis is about the same thing as heroin.
i believe its a bit of a generational issue in Ireland i believe most people under 40 or so are for or on the fence with cannabis decriminalizing.
Think the majority of people are in favour of more access to medical cannabis and not wasting gardi, court and free legal aid on people caught with personal use amounts, most polls done are in favour or legal market or decrim.
No it does not, an opposition TD has brought forward a bill to decrim 7g for personal use, it will not pass as the sitting government do support it and will vote it away. I wish we were legalising or even that this bill would pass but unfortunately it wont.
As an Irish man I don't see Ireland decriminalizing cannabis any time soon, not in the next 5 years anyway.
