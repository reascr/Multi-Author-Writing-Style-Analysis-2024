The priority here SEEMS to be getting them more arms while only encouraging talks. It's not as if the additional arms comes with a seemingly aggressive requirement for peace.
Yeah right Hungary, Poland, Czechia, Romania, Slovakia and Bulgaria are all top fairly easy military targets right next to Russia and all part of NATO. Turkey may as well be on the last too since they are both troublemakers and in a highly strategic area that Russia would love to have if they could.
It seems like you have no clue about what countries are in NATO or what countries the USSR had taken over in the past and would be prime target. Almost all of them are now in NATO, unfortunately Ukraine is the one big one that isn't.
yes ukraine was not in NATO and now im seeing people talk about not wanting them in NATO because of "risk".
if NATO is so afraid of having to actually serve its purpose and defend something that they refuse "risky" members then clearly NATO is no longer fit for purpose and should be dismantled.
but a defensive alliance that excludes a potential member because they may have to defend them is no longer fit for purpose.
