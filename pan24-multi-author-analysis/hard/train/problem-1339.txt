There is no access. The police is not setup for this amd it will be years before Oregon can issue a permit under these guidelines. Oregon fudged itself and took away their own 2A rights.
There are no police anything setup for firearm approvals. This will take at least a year to get setup which means the people of Oregon will no be able to buy 2A firearms. This is an attack on the 2A and if you cant see past the lies youre basically a shell. If the intent was to instill firearms training courses before selling you a gun then then Constitution should be ammended. This is BS and Im surprised Oregon fell for this BS.
Background checks are already a thing nationwide, it’s dumb for Oregon to be like “oh yea, me too!”. 3 day waiting period as well, already in place.
There are no statistics to show that magazine bans actually do anything. Plus, you think the cops are going to give up all of their mags that hold more than 10? Nope, they still gonna mag dump someone’s back with 17 rounds before they reload.
The FBI statistics show that in a defense shooting situation, the average number of times you pull the trigger is like 3-4 times. However, that’s just an average; yes, a single shot really could stop a threat, but I don’t want to take the chance that I’ll get it done in 4 or less shots. I’ve seen videos where a threat soaks up a mag dump and is still attacking the cops. I can comfortably carry 17 rounds with no issues, there’s no reason to do anything different.
The gun I carry everyday, it was designed with a 17 round capacity in mind. I don’t see a need to reduce that number for any reason.
