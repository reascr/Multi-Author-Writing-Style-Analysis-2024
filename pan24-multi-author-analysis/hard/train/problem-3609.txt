The free market is amazing until it’s working against you. Musk is about to find out the same way Parler did that even with free speech you still need to moderate the platform itself.
“Musk frames the dispute with Apple as an issue over free speech and content moderation, and Republican politicians agree.”.
Musk is trying to force Apple to remove the mobile Twitter app from the app store in order to give Republicans an excuse to attack “woke corporations” that are “censoring” free speech.
Honestly, as much as I dislike Musk now due to his right wing nonsense, I do think that the monopoly power that Apple has over its app store is problematic.
Either they have to allow other storefronts on their phones imo, or they shouldn’t charge apps for access.
Monopoly over access. They have complete control over what apps can get downloaded onto iPhones, and the ability to decide how much app makers have to pay to get that access. They can abuse their market position to extort app developers on the App Store.
I am not saying that Apple's ability to determine what can be downloaded from their store is problematic. I am saying that Apple's ability to determine what can be downloaded from the App store, along with banning any other storefronts and forcing app developers to pay 30% of their revenues is what's problematic. It's like the modern version of the company town during the Gilded Age. It's abusive and anti-competitive.
