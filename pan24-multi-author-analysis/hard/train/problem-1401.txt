They have annual PTO, which is used for sick days (as in many other companies). They start out with one week annually, but the average employee has three weeks annually.
> At the start of February, workers got 30 points. Taking time off almost always costs them between two and 15 points. They can only earn [four] points back by being available for work with 90 minutes’ notice for 14 consecutive days, meaning they can’t go out of town, schedule doctors appointments, or go to a movie. Use all 30 points and they get suspended and given 15 more points. Use those 15 points and they get suspended even longer and given their last 15 points. Use those and they’re fired.
Sick days are a red herring. Railroad workers want unpaid leave. When you clock out on Friday, you don't get paid but you also can't be called into work at a moment's notice.
Railroad workers are still on call even when they go home, unless they use PTO. They can't schedule a doctor's visit when their employer might suddenly call them into work. They can't do much of anything at all.
They can't do that, because they aren't. Republicans are the party of rich white men, Democrats are the party of rich people of any skin colour and gender.
