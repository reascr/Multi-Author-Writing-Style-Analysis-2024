I could be wrong, but from what I read, the New York state courts stopped the rampant gerrymandering you saw allowed in Florida, Texas, Georgia and other Republican controlled states. Democrats are complete idiots, instead of doing what Republicans have done and changed state laws to help them take/retain power, they instead believe in having fair representation.
Well you see, when the main point of an election is to elect candidates to represent your state, you might start giving people a reason to blame specific states.
A lot of the weirder gerrymandered districts are actually that way to comply with voting rights. If they had just drawn them in a way that was visually sensible, it would have resulted in minority disenfranchisement.
Not all Gerrymandering is bad, it is actually a nessecary process so long as there is still inequality or geographic separation. If everyone was equally well off, and there was no racial or class based discrimination of location, then we could throw out gerrymandering.
Not to mention just totally pissing off every kind of social or ethnic minority possible lately; me included. I'm not a fence-sitter and always vote, BUT I KINDA WISH I COULD SHOUT MY VOTE THIS CYCLE.
