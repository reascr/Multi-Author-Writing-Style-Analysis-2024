This has been driving me nuts too. Had the Suozzi or Zimmerman campaigns done even minimal research, they'd have started finding this stuff the week after the Republican primary was over. How fucking incompetent does a Congressional campaign have to be to just completely refuse to do even cursory opposition research?!?
“You know what? I could say the same thing about the Democrats, I could say the same thing about Joe Biden; why aren’t they being called out for their lies? Why isn’t anybody talking about the Democrat Party lying machine?”.
I heard a clip from Fox News yesterday where Tulsi Gabbard, the fill-in host for Tucker Carlson (yeah, seriously), asked Santos if he has any shame for lying about his resume. Guess what he said in response? (my paraphrased version).
Tl;dr your average Republican voter wants rules for the out group and none for the in group (which they consider themselves a part of). Santos helps them accomplish that, his background be damned.
Many of these goals prop up the others, but the crucial step is beating Democrats – which Santos did handily. The remaining four will inevitably follow.
