It's a tank killer in the objective sense, judging from its experience in Operation Desert Storm (ODS) where it only took 3 non-friendly-fire losses (out of 1730 Bradleys deployed) while facing tanks. The TOW 2A missiles they can carry have a longer range than NLAW and older Javelins and more explosives than NLAW (the TOW 2B missiles are even better). The ODS Bradleys put their missiles to good use in the Battle of 73 Eastings.
The tank killer on a Bradley is it's pair of TOW missiles, which are fantastically effective against any armor out there currently.
A common mostly defensive tactic is to build up a series of berms for tanks to sit behind/on, roll up acquire target, fire, fall back and reload and watch as the missiles fly over head. You set up 4 tanks or so in a coordinated fire pattern and they have sustained constant direct fire attack. Drones and other indirect fire systems are designed to help mitigate such tactics.
TOW missiles are mostly wired guided and range limited to about 4300m, a main cannon on a MBT like the Abrams is over 5000 with advanced Optics. Further cannon rounds travel faster than missiles.
AP rounds are mostly propellant: the bullet flies out of the cannon at higher speeds, but that also means it loses energy quicker while flying.
