After 10 years, Ukraine will have the most modern factories, shipping terminals, communications systems, etc. because everything needs to be rebuilt. Having such a modern base will make Ukrainian services and products very competitive on a global scale.
And exactly for the reason you give, Ukraine must join both the EU and NATO after this war. Let's see Russia threaten Ukraine when it as well as other countries have their missiles pointed at Moscow.
Russia will be able to send missiles, rockets and artillery shells into Ukraine FOR THE REST OF HUMAN HISTORY.
If Ukraine wins... can bet your ass it'll have several NATO or US military bases established and a massive uplift in missile defense systems and long range missiles.
Let's just agree to disagree then, the internal pressure in Russia is growing and the west have agreed to start providing offensive weapons to Ukraine.
I agree the war will not be over in the next 6 months but in a year or 2 I find it hard to believe that all of these combined pressures will not cause Russia to crack.
Every day that this war continues the rest of the world solidifies their resolve that Russia must no longer be a top military power.
