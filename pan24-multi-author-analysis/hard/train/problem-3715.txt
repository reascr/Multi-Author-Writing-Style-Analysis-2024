Trump takes a $20 million loan from North Korea, has a meal with a dude who praised Hitler along with a white supremacist AND wants axe the constitution. (Everything else aside, I’m going by news cycle). But all Republicans are concerned about is Hunter Biden’s dick pics.
Does some of the data make Hunter Biden look bad? Well yea, but that's not even remotely news. Anyone that follows politics knows Hunter Biden has had substance abuse issues, we know Hunter Biden had sex with his dead brothers wife. We know Hunter Biden had some nude pics, we know we have pictures of Hunter Biden doing drugs, etc. None of that is disputed.
The story itself doesn't pass the sniff test. Hunter dropped off his laptop at a random store, to a blind man who has no receipts.
I will say this, once I did stumble across a picture folder. The customer in question was a very large woman, she was also a teacher at the local school. She also apparently enjoyed being involved in gang bangs and recording it. It was not something we enjoyed looking at. Thankfully never ran across CP, that was always my biggest fear (FYI that was a mandatory report if we did).
