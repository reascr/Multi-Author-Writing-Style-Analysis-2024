I don't even gaf if it shows his son smoking crack and banging hookers. There is no denying Jr is smoking crack and banging the hooker that's his wife...maybe.
So to say "well everyone does it" is the fucking problem. I hate trump and am excited to see Rupert Murdoch bury him on move television w a golden shovel but he did bring the corruption of the American governments last twenty years into focus. And he's probably about to split the Republican Party or fleece them for a billion dollars to bow out gracefully. Silver linings.
And I don't care about the laptop or him smoking crack but if you made it your life's work you couldn't convince me that hunter Biden wasn't employed at Burisma in a way devoid of corruption.
Even better, if Hunter and Joe Biden are such obvious criminals, why didn't the DoJ under your leadership for 4 years investigate, indict, and try them in a court of law?
Of course, that same Rep (Comer), who is in line to chair one of the committees, has said that “We’re not trying to prove Hunter Biden is a bad actor, He is.", so I'm sure the investigation will be totally fair and impartial...
