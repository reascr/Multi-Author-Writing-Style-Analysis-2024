The US and allies should be supplying Ukraine with longer range munitions to delete every Russian piece of kit in Crimea.
Ukraine has already been hitting targets in Russia, just not with western long-range weapons. It's been drone attacks and sabotage.
But if we're going to be honest, if Ukraine was told "our continued support of you is contingent these ATACMS don't get used on Russian territory proper", they would quite likely follow that directive.
interesting if you think in an all out war between russia and ukraine it isn't a possibility ukraine run out of soldiers first.
That will force Russia hands to do an all out mobilization, and potentially NATO soldiers to be mobbed since Ukrainian bodies might run out.
You’re assuming a lot: that Russians will cooperate with a full mobilization. That Ukraine, a country of 43 million people, will somehow “run out of bodies.” That other countries won’t step up their responses long before that occurs. That if that somehow does occur, that NATO would then decide that that’s the time to put boots on the ground.
