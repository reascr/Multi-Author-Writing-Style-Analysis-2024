“The U.S. should be mindful that no matter how desperately it may seek to disarm (North Korea), it can never deprive (North Korea) of its right to self-defense and that the more hell-bent it gets on the anti-(North Korea) acts, it will face a more fatal security crisis,” she said in a statement carried by state media.

Kim Yo Jong, who is widely considered North Korea's second most powerful person after her brother, lambasted the United States for issuing what she called “a disgusting joint statement together with such rabbles as Britain, France, Australia, Japan and South Korea.”.
Kim compared the United States to “a barking dog seized with fear.” She said North Korea would consider the U.S.-led statement “a wanton violation of our sovereignty and a grave political provocation.”.
The problem with N Korea is not that they are a direct threat to the US, but how they could very easily disrupt our interests in the area and could potentially threaten our allies.
If that were true the US wouldn't hold massive military exercises with South Korea every year right outside North Korea and the USA wouldn't send bombers near the border when NK launches missiles. The USA government cares , I don't think the average citizen cares.
