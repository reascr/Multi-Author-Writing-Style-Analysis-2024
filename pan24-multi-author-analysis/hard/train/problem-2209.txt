Even if the West agrees by some miracle, What reason would India have to negotiate these talks? An End to the War would be amazing for India but mediating it would not. Assume these peace talks fail and Russia breaks some ceasfire, The blame would be equally put on India for both being the nation who hosted the talks and for being unable to mediate. And if we are being real here, There is a high probability such a scenario will occur. It's a high risk High reward scenario, But the Risk is worse than the reward. And you bet failed negotiation will hurt more than succeful negotiation will help.
I don't understand you Western leftists, Don't you see that just because a guy is right wing doesn't mean he is like Trump?
No. Even as an Indian who supports the oil deal this is a scenario that won't happen. The West has agreed to let India buy oil, But that doesn't mean they will accept India to mediate any discussions of peace. Mediating discussions of peace by India would mean silent aknowledgement that India buying Russian oil meant it was being a neutral party, Which the West would never agree to thus The West would prevent Ukraine from allowing India to host any peace talks.
The only way for this war to end is for Ukraine to realise that Russia is trying to help them, and to peacefully surrender and stop their actions which are escalating world tensions.
