So US companies have announced about $200 billion worth of stock buybacks so far this year. By end of the year, let's say that's 1.2 trillion on same pace.
That 4% is $40 billion dollars in tax revenue. Not a small amount of money by many standards, but the actual question is not if 4% is the right number, it's if 4% will cut into or negate the value of the process of stock buybacks in the first place enough to discourage it?
Yeah the thing about buybacks being such a delay in the taxes being paid by the shareholder are why I don’t mind a small excise tax on buybacks, I’m just pushing back on some of those comments about buybacks being purely stock manipulation.
Buyback artificially pushed up the price of the stock, allowing the shareholders to delay paying their taxes until they sell. It’s essentially just a tax dodging loophole with no real value to the economy.
Putting aside the laughably low effective tax rates of companies on their profit, before buybacks was legal, shareholders must be paid dividends(which is taxable), or the company enjoys rapid growth for the shareholders to see a return on their investment.
For as long as this loophole exists we're encouraging the rich to over-capitalize corporations in order so they can pay less taxes on increasing share value instead of just paying that money out as income.
It also creates a moral hazard since capital gains tax can be delayed until realization, every year they delay is an incentive to dump money into lobbying to lower the capital gains rate further, making the tax system even more unjust.
