No, it didn't. Hitler's entire concept of race and blood purity had him convinced that literally all Jewish people on earth needed to die if the Germans were to survive. A single Jewish person left alive would be a failure in Hitler's eyes. Let alone in an area that Hitler considered part of Germany. (There were thousands of Jews still alive in Berlin by the end of WWII as well, tho obviously under the radar).
To label the Holocaust as "winning against the Jews" is quite frankly something that I imagine most Jewish people would at the least not agree with, if not be outright offended by.
This strikes me as highly biased whataboutism that ignores the reality that Zionists made deals with the Nazis and literally tried to become allies with them in Palestine (based on their authoritarian ideals being similar no less). Seems like he's got a one-sided agenda.
He should do it ex cathedra, if he gave a shit. Catholic doctrine says that he's infallible when doing so, and literally channeling truth through God.
It is historical fact that the Catholic Church did not stand against the Nazis in a meaningful way. I mean something like 30-40% of Nazis WERE Catholics.
How many prominent Catholic Nazis were there to start with? The Nazi party wasn't a big fan of Catholicism (they didn't like any other large institutions which might command people's loyalty in a direction they didn't like) and you can't excommunicate someone who was never Catholic to begin with.
