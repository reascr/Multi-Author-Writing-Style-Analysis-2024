That's not Republican spin. They're saying it's a big deal now because the media and Republicans are rabid to find scandals for Biden and they just don't really exist.
The opposite of that is acknowledging that it's probably not that dire and that it has happened multiple times before and neither been a news story or resulted in calamity shows that it's only being made a deal of now because they want to harm Biden.
So you're saying it's a huge deal and bad that Biden allowed it to happen? Because that's the Republican spin.
So yes, the Republican outrage was delusional. But so was the blanket coverage on mainstream media. This was a headline news story for days.
As an example, CNN was running the headline that "Tensions Rising" with China over the shooting down of the balloon. CNN reporters were confronting Chinese officials, who themselves said that the US Government was "overhyping" the story. CNN then has the ranking Democrat member of the Intelligence Committee on, who was saying shooting it down was a "huge intelligence win". You will notice that Republicans and Democrats don't really differ in their assessment that this was some kind of serious threat by China. They only differ in they assessment of how the White House reacted to it. This was a 10 minute prime time segment on CNN dedicated to the story - it wasn't just Republicans going crazy over this story.
The point is, this wasn't a story manufactured by Republicans. They overhyped it no doubt. But both Democrats and Republicans were acting as this balloon was a grave infringement by China - they only differed in assessing the White House response to this "threat". This was made into a big story by mainstream media, not just "right leaning media".
So why was it all over the news on largely Democrat leaning media? This wasn't a story confined to Fox News and Newsmax. There are plenty of those types of Republican outrage stories. This wasn't one of them.
