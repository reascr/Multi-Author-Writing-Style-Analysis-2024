I no longer work in international development but the fact is that no matter where this happens, it's always the girls that are completely fucked.
I agree 1,000%. The organization I worked for actually did that. You have to help people in the ways that they want to be helped, unless the help that they want is going against someone else's rights.
Some of the solutions are pretty accessible but not popular for cultural or social reasons. Creating opportunities for women isn't impossible, we've done it throughout history and are still doing it today.
I'd argue that a lot of effort internationally went into allowing a generation of women in Afghanistan a chance at education and rights.
I agree that realistically, the best way to improve lives of people is to provide good education, especially to women, and especially emphasize gender equality from young age.
I think there also just needs to be a culture change, let girls be as "useful" as their brothers not by selling them off like chattel, but permitting them to pursue the same education and find jobs that will also lead to improving the family's life.
