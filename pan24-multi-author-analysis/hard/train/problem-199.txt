Iran is not a young country whatsoever and their system is religious extremism doesn't allow non extremists in power.
Basically, people are protesting; the government of Iran doesn’t allow protests against them so they send in their military police to suppress them. Violence ensues, protestors die, and yes, also police. Police arrests a bunch of people that they claim were involved.
They sentence them to a highly dubious crime of “war against God”, which essentially lets the Iranian state suspend all rights that you usually are afforded as a citizen accused of a crime. That’s why the sentencing takes 15 minutes. No defense, no appeals, court sees you once, gives you a sentence, they arrest you and 2 weeks after you’re executed.
Note that they’re only specifically using this sentencing when it’s people attacking government forces, Iran has a normal judicial system for crimes between individuals usually, including murder. But the government sees itself as god apparently and attacking them is made equivalent to an attack against god so they allow themselves to just do what they please when it’s people that they don’t like. They’re executing about 5-6 people for every policeman that died. No one knows how they’re making their conclusions so quickly, it’s highly doubtful that everyone getting killed was actually involved in the killing, let alone in a sufficient fashion to warrant execution. But we’ll never know, because Iran hides behind Sharia law to do whatever they want to behind closed doors without any way to resist or defend yourself. Mind you, more protestors than police are dying in these clashes, but of course, 0 police ends up getting any sentencing….
