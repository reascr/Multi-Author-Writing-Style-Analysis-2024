Bulgarian living in California here. Weâ€™ve been in the Bay Area since 2002. Both of my parents are exactly as you described.
My father always talks about how democracy ruined the country, how it was better before, etc. Yet here they are reaping the benefits of democracy.
This is a war for liberal democracy. It's a war for the global legal and diplomatic frameworks that enable peace, prosperity, and safety. It's a war for nationhood, for independence, for self-determination, and for humanity itself.
It's a war being fought with Western weapons and Ukrainian courage and blood over what the next century will look like for the entire world. Russia simply cannot be allowed to win.
I mean even if Russia "wins" it'll be Pyrrhic victory at best. They've already lost far more than they could have ever hoped to gain by invading Ukraine.
That said, Ukraine can still lose. And that's something I don't want to see. Screw Putin, and screw anyone supporting him.
Let's not call the ruling party PIS wise, they just hate Putin's Russia (for good reason). In other news, PIS abolishes the independent justice system. You'd think they have seen that too.
