Former ambassador as in doesn't have any insider information and is evaluating what's happening in Putins regime based on one state news segment?
And being an expert on Russia and being the ambassador, they tend to accumulate many information sources inside the country.
The person that gets posted to a US ambassadorship in an important country like Russia is rarely a political appointee like they are for less strategic countries. They are usually experts on the country long before they’re even considered for the role.
Unlike working at Burger King, when you leave the job, you tend to stay connected to your network of intelligence assets and even members of the CIA that operated out of the embassy you were in charge of.
A lot of it is because, even if you leave government service, you’re still an expert on Russia and that is your career path. Maybe you’re teaching at a university or you sit on the board of a company that has business in Russia and you’re asked to grease wheels and get the company meetings with high level Russian officials that you knew during your service.
