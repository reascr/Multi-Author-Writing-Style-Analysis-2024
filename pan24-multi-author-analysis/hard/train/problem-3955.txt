Hey now, to be fair he's always said that he was just escorting his family there and always intended to return immediately. It was just a normal family vacation at a Mexican resort for his wife, his kids, and another man. Totally normal...
There's a very active movement on the right and especially on reddit to try and frame the invasion as something that Russia had no choice but to undertake. Shit, I got some propagandist in another thread calling me a chickenhawk for saying that right wing activity in Ukraine does not justify the invasion.
Well, one major difference is that the people wearing the Ukrainian flags as a show of support probably actually give a shit about what's going on in Ukraine.
Best way to respond to this is "yeah, no shit, I support Ukraine's fight against the invasion of fascists because I'm not an idiot" and let that hang.
When we are talking about politics ultimately most of these types of being an asshole is in support of a fascist agenda, so you could just say fascist. Since it is literally a political movement based on the idea of being assholes to everyone who doesn't fit within a very narrow spectrum, it is quite appropriate in this situation.
He's right but it's weird to cast virtue signaling as a bad thing that only your enemies do - it's how all American political groups express their political identities. By publicly signaling what their virtues are. Ted does it, dems do it, Twitter libs do it, the magas on parler and truth social do it, boomer fox News grandpa's do it with bumper stickers, tankies do it, libertarians do it. He's stupidly pointing to something normal as if it's a problem.
