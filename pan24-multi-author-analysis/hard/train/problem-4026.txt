I'll note those were pretty much completely unguided besides some sort of pressure sensor that controlled ballast to maintain a certain altitude. It was basically pray the wind blows the right way.
A modern weaponized balloon wouldn't be that bad for a long ranged attack. If the US is letting it fly over our airspace, the only thing that would be different is having some sort of payload attached.
seems like the FAA has pretty clearly defined prohibited airspaceâ€¦ but hey at least you tried, right?
As for flying over an air force facility, was that a published MOA or NSA restricted airspace? And what altitudes are restricted?
Not all of CONUS airspace is controlled at the same level at all altitudes. Some areas or zones that are restricted at lower categories (ie control zones around civil airports) may be open at higher altitudes for passenger routes, etc. Some areas that may have higher altitude restrictions may not have those same restrictions lower.
Please show the class where you found "standard US Policy for spy balloons". As someone who has worked in air defense for over a decade I've never seen it, and I've helped design and maintain a lot of missile and early warning radars that form the backbone of the system that protects our air space.
