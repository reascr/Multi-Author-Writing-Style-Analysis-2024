So is a poly marriage when every member marries each other (husband marries wife 1, wife 1 marries wife 2, wife 2 marries husband). Or is it Husband marries Wife 1 and 2 but the wives are not married to each other.
In a weird round-a-bout way, this bill might help poly marriages get recognized too. This bill essentially says "A legal marriage in one of the 50 states, must be recognized in all 50 states.".
California has a somewhat similar law, that says "a legal marriage from another country will be recognized as legal marriage in California" The California law has been used to get California to legally recognize the marriages between a polygamist man and his wives as valid under the law.
Following this logic to its conclusion, this bill might be used require states to recognize any legal marriage from anywhere in the world, and some countries legally allow poly marriages.
(b) No Federal recognition of polygamous marriages.â€”Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed to require or authorize Federal recognition of marriages between more than 2 individuals.
