These movements are global and we should treat them as such.The biggest favor we can do to oppressors is focusing on division.
Wait so do you want me to acknowledge that women and minorities are struggling to have their rights affirmed and acknowledged in the U.S. or not?
Just because women and minorities in the US and other parts of the world are still having to fight for equal rights and treatment doesn't mean we can't support those in Iran and their fight as well.
My other complaint is: people from "free countries" oppressing the women and immigrants in their own countries while being upset about Iran oppressing people.
Eta. The down votes really show that people don't want to look inward, as well ("as well" being key). Good on y'all virtue signaling. Easy enough to allow someone to die in your own land because "those people" while being pissed about it happening elsewhere.
ðŸ¤£ So whilst you're like "we should focus on all of it" you're missing the point that I mention that. Like, people are literally out here focusing on one thing at a time while refusing to acknowledge the things happening in their own areas.
Also, cute that you discuss only the U.S. and act as though people aren't actively dying. Both in the U.S. and everywhere else dealing with these issues.
