I mean, this is just going to be an exercise in evolutionary pressure over a sufficiently long period of time.
People (and cultures) hesitant, resistant, or openly hostile to vaccines are going to see their numbers dwindle over time.
When it comes to Vaccines, I don't think you can even sue the Government, but this is just a red herring that the anti-vaxxers like to throw out.
We don't, because it's an absurd premise that any of those manufacturers would somehow get a vaccine through testing without it being tested. That's the basis of the argument that there's not enough oversight. We have a stringent process for this already. We haven't been operating in the dark; that's yet another conspiracy theory that rings true until you give it the slightest scrutiny.
Think about life before three years ago. Almost everyone "believed in" vaccines. They've saved millions of lives and prevented perhaps billions of cases of illness. They've rid the world of some diseases. Only the people desperately clinging to vaccines as the culprit for autism were anti-vax back then. But conservative media had done such a good job feeding gullible people's conspiratorial thinking about the government trying to trick them somehow (remember that Bill Gates was tracking us through this specific vaccine for some reason?) that it caught on that if you really didn't like the ouchy that you get from a needle, you could pretend to be super smart and have it all figured out instead of looking like a coward who didn't mind being a carrier for the disease that might kill your neighbors like it did my grandfather.
