He didn't get out of his charges because of political connections or his money, he got out because the entire case depended on the testimony of a person who turned out to be unreliable and a criminal himself.
Joel Greenberg is the person in question, who was just recently sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for criminal stalking, identity theft, wire fraud, and conspiracy to bribe a public official, as well as one charge of sex trafficking.
To be clear, Greenberg (the witness in question) is a convicted fraudster who is motivated by wanting a better plea deal and fabricated a child sex trafficking allegation against a political rival.
One of the other witnesses is the child who was raped. She doesnt believe that she was a victim and so is unlikely to be a cooperative witness.
“The New York Times reported that the girl "has said she does not believe she was a victim," which would introduce issues in court.”.
The girl said she did not feel that she was a victim and that would cause issues in court?? Motherfuckers, WHY would that cause any issues in court? If an adult has sex with a 17 year old, it doesn’t matter whether she thought she was a willing participant or not - do we as a society think this is wrong or do we not??? I’m so fucking sick of this. A 17 year old is a CHILD.
