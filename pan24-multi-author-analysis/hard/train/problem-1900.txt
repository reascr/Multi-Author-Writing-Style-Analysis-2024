- Can the House & Senate be compared in terms of "importance"? As in, if the Dems hypothetically had to "choose" one to win, is the Senate victory more important?
- Which states do the Dems need/which states look like the Dems could win and simultaneously win the Senate majority?
Democrats need to gain one seat for Senate majority. They will need two of Arizona, Nevada, or Georgia to get it. Or longshot flip Wisconsin.
Senate is more important due to getting presidential confirmations through. House is important because that's where the budget originates. A GOP House will be incredibly annoying with conspiracy theory investigations and impeachments, but ultimately won't do much of anything other than a lot of yelling and screaming.
With the House, the Republicans will gain subpoena/investigative powers, so expect impeachment, endless hearings and special investigations (like Jan 6), and can also prevent any legislation from being passed. They could maybe cause a government shut down but I could be mistaken.
Senate matters quite a lot for the judiciary. Biden nominates federal judges, Senate can approve them with a simple majority. Dems controlled the House for half of Trump's presidency but not the Senate, and that's how Republicans shoved through hundreds of often unqualified, far right judges who now have lifetime appointments and are wreaking all kinds of havoc.
