There’s failures on every angle of this issue and no one approach will fix it all. I certainly don’t have the answers!
While I agree that there is a more systematic approach to be taken when it comes to cutting down on cartel activity, I’d argue that the war on drugs has been a colossal failure and likely has had the opposite effect.
For anyone that is vehemently opposed to illegal immigration, I’d challenge them to listen to a refugees story from start to finish and then tell me that they don’t deserve a chance at a better life.
As in, migrants seeking asylum from their terrible conditions is a non-story -- it's just another version of "brown people bad" that the right pushes. An "invasion" narrative that news outlets drum up year after year as a filler story until the next culture war topic inevitably takes hold.
It happens all the time to drum up drama because the 24-hour news cycle is insatiable — and it’s typically a filler news story from right wing news outlets until some other culture war topic begins. It’s tiring.
