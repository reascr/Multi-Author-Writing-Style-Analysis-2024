That number is disputed but migrant construction workers and manual laborers get treated like slaves nonetheless.
Reform is on the way tho, since they had a system that took away passports removed. But that’s after the fact.
It’s for all migrant workers including non construction based work. So thats why the 6500 number is disputed.
The 6500 is a misleading number for the Guardian. That is all migrant workers in that period, not just World Cup related.
They don’t care about LGBT issues, it’s contrary to their religion and value system. They are not about to throw their religion under the bus to placate some virtue signalling westerners hell bent on cultural colonialism.
The World Cup has been great too, been following it on the TV. Absolutely no evidence of any boycotts.
No country is perfect, especially our white western ones who went round the world robbing, raping, murdering and enslaving on an unimaginable industrial scale.
It’s incredibly insulting to other countries around the world that we insist our values matter more than theirs. It’s arrogance based purely on our white privilege.
