The AR15 to the far right in a lot of ways has become a symbol of there march towards fascism. Its a way of saying they Support the use of guns as a tool to force through the Christian white nationalist agenda.
This is the extremist GOP’s way of reminding the Dems and their supporters that their side has the guns and has no qualms about using them.
They made a hero out of Kyle Rittenhouse, for god’s sake, as though what he did was righteous and patriotic. They continue to lionize the January 6 insurrectionists and paint them as unjustly persecuted freedom fighters. There are thousands of gun murders every year, including the murdered children in Uvalde, the innocent shoppers in Buffalo, and so many others just last year in terrorist attacks with that exact gun that they are wearing on their lapels. It is so bizarre and grotesque. The most outlandish parody from ten years ago could not capture the reality of today’s GOP.
The fact that you think you have a gotcha moment with the George floyd protests just shows how distorted your worldview is.
Who riled up that mob mentality? Who spent months crying wolf to make people mad enough to "back the blue" into the corner and beat them with flag poles?
Wow what a false equivalency. One was a mostly peaceful protest where police got crazy and attacked journalists in response to another police killing of an unarmed black man.
The other was an insurrection because the former president wanted to overturn an election and baited and encouraged his base to storm the capitol to stop the proceedings that day.
I'm not even American so your political ideology means nothing to me, but your perception of reality is concerning.
