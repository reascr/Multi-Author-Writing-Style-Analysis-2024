Sort of. The smarter move was to use that money to pay down high interest debt first (credit cards), low interest debt second(car loans), save for retirement third using total market ETFs. Inflation has been high and wages have gone up. Any debt you owe that isnâ€™t accruing interest is better sitting and letting your money work for you instead.
Yeah, while one time debt cancellation is a nice thing, it's really a band aid that doesn't address the root problem, which is the interest being insurmountable. Plus the debt cancellation is a political lightning rod.
In the plan that the administration laid out, interest wouldn't accrue if a person was faithful in payments--but this only applied to income based repayment plans. I personally think they should just extend this to all federal loans, even if someone isn't on an IBR plan.
At this point, I really don't care if it survives or not. If it does, great. If not, go back and retool it. Get rid of the $10/20k forgiveness and focus on interest. Take the interest down to zero if you're making faithful payments or have some other kind of plan. Give people who volunteer a tax credit they can put toward the balance of their loans.
I think most people with student loans would agree they don't mind paying them back in full, so long as their payments actually went to the loan principle. And I think most people across the breadth of the political spectrum would be fine with lowering the interest rates on student loans. And that would prevent future generations from being screwed over as well.
