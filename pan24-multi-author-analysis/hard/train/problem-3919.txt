So Russia increases oil supply to China, India and Turkey by 2.4 million barrels per day. 3 countries who collectively consume 18 million barrels per day and some how Russias economy is going to get anhilated because Europe is buying oil from the former suppliers to Turkey, China and India? Or did Europe suddenly discover and develope a massive oil field? I don't follow your logic. Russia had a budget surplus in October and their trade with 3 emerging mega economies is glowing, their economy is far from being destroyed.
LNG is not oil. It is far more expensive per unit output of energy. They are buying up supply that was already called for further causing the price of Russias number 1 export, natural gas, to rise.
Anyway you do have a point in that a lot of the places Russia will be supplying are expected to grow massively economically.
Yeah kind of, they're opening up far more ability to import LNG via vessels from North America which has shitloads, and elsewhere. Not to mention, it's already cheaper to switch to alternatives for many uses but takes time.
