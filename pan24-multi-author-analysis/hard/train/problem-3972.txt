Russia's blustering has reached the point of absurdity. If I were advising strategy for the U.S. & Europe, I would contend that they are indeed a paper tiger, and to call their bluff. For every announcement that Russia makes threatening vague, but grave consequences for the support of a NATO country, (like releasing video of an icbm missle with multiple warheads being loaded into a silo), I would counter with a brief and consistment statement which states NATO will continue to provide any support they deem fit to assist Ukraine to regain their illegally annexed land. Period.
You're selling the EU members of NATO quite short, I assure you. Especially when you consider that they are a tightly integrated force. If you really think all these forces combined in one command structure could not defeat Russia in a conventional war, you're mistaken: UK, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Spain, Portugal, Norway...shall I go on? There's like 6 more. I hope you get the point.
That's what I'm thinking. Attack a NATO country and see what happens. Russia still doesn't have air superiority and their nine/ten months in? NATO would do it in less than 24 hours. Russia is very obviously a paper tiger, feckless, and severely lacking in many military advances since WWII. Ukraine is beating them with our last generation of equipment, Russia isn't ready for the current generation and would be at the whim of the people who decide how bad they want to crush them.
