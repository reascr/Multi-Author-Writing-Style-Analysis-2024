Cassidy initially went with a Trump world attorney who was not working on her behalf and refuses to sign an engagement letter with her. He advises her to not reveal anything she doesn't have to. She reaches out to a mysterious unnamed Republicans congressperson who advises her to do what she thinks is right. So she secretly asks the committee to have her back for a third deposition so she can come clean about details without her attorney knowing she alerted them. Also the entire time, her attorney is finding future employment for her as well. And while this was going on the campaign was literally paying her living expenses. She finally dumped him after he advised her to stop talking and risk prison time not for her benefit, but for Trump's.
She is very clear about her thought processes in the December 14 transcript. She was scared, without the $ to hire an attorney, and her family was no help. Read it and your questions will be answered.
What an ass. Just because they don't know or can't prove you committed perjury doesn't mean that's not perjury.
Yeah, but the point is that he was advising her to perjure herself (which she didn't), because no one would know. Imagine an attorney giving instructions on how to steal money so no one would find out, it's basically the same thing.
This quote struck me as deeply idiotic as well. I am not versed in American law, but can't the lawyer be disbarred for this? He is basically advising perjury.
