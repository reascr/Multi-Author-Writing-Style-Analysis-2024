Aka "maybe we should think about classifying weed as 'not as bad' as fucking meth." According to the united states federal government, weed is worse than meth.
Mmm yes, tell me more about how America cares about its citizens while it trades a mass murderer for someone jailed for weed while having thousands of its own citizens in jail for the very same thing?
We traded an American citizen that was being cruelly punished publicly and there's no telling what else they would have done to her regardless of fame status...
It really bothers me when American citizens get locked up in other countries either cruelty or unfairly. It’s probably a good thing I’ll never be in charge of the country because I’m ok with them putting boots on the ground to recover Americans as long as there not deservedly locked up.
I do not need to read an article to know she was cruelly punished. I can’t find the original article. I read an article that asked a bunch of lawyers what they thought about her sentence. The lawyers said based on the guidelines it was fair. I believe the sentencing guidelines where 2 to 10 years. The prosecutors wanted max fines and 9 and 3/4 years in prison. The judge gave her max fines and 9 years in prison.
I’m conservative so a lot of people in my circle don’t like this trade. A lot of my liberal friends also seem not to like this trade. What I have been telling people is at least be happy we got an American back. It’s a win. Maybe they got back more but we got an American back.
