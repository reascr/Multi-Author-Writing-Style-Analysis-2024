To the people from Boebert's district in Colorado, you have until tomorrow to "cure" or fix your ballot. If your ballot has not been counted because of some technicality, you can fix it and the ballot will be counted.
Typically what is going on at this stage is verification of mail-in votes. When they receive a mail-in ballot, they compare the signature on the ballot to the one on file. If they don’t feel it matches, they set that ballot aside and don’t count it. That ballot then goes to some group who starts reaching out to verify that the ballot is valid. Once they verify that, the ballot can be counted.
What is different about the vote count during a recount? Are the votes just put into the same tabulation machines and then they go with the second count? Or is a recount done by hand?
Basically I’m just wondering why it’s right to recount a difference of 20 votes but not a difference of one vote.
Shouldn’t a shift of over 1% of votes draw our attention regardless of which party’s candidate win?
Also, I love the comments on all of the political posts. Regardless of party affiliation so many posters are absolutely confident of the opinions of every registered voter of the opposite party.
