I've been noticing it's like every week or so, another minister, cabinet member, judge, or government official is sacked. In nearly every case, non-government Ukrainian-based news sources can point to specific acts of corruption from these officials.
Let's be real, Ukraine was one of the most politically corrupt nations in Europe. Likely still is. And that's not going to change "swiftly" no matter what happens.
Also this does NOT mean it was acceptable for Russia to invade them, or that other nations should not assist Ukraine.
The west's interest is helping Ukraine and fucking Russia in the ass, so papering over this is well worth it. We can have strings attached when they'll need our money to rebuild their economy after war.
It's the same as Saudi Arabia, a huge US ally. They're assholes who live in medieval times... But give the US a huge foothold right in the gulf. Honestly SA is a lot more realpolitik than Ukraine, for that matter.
This is true, but there are a lot of people here who never paid any attention to Ukraine before now.
