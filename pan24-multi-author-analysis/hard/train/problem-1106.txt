I had posted this elsewhere. They try to frame it as people don't want to work but where I live in one of the top 25 most populous cities in the US, people have been priced out of the area. A recent report showed there was not a single apartment in the city that a person making $15 an hour could qualify to rent (30% of income rule) and many places just pay minimum wage or even less for restaurant workers. It's hard to fill positions when the wages paid will not allow you to live in the area.
Pay people a living wage. That’s the only feasible solution to the labor shortage. Stop being a bunch of egotistical, money hoarding assholes and pay people enough to live on. You don’t need all that extra money and you can’t take it with you where you’re going after the big dirt nap so crack open your wallets and start shelling it out. It’s only going to get worse if you don’t.
They’re not really now, so this will only make things worse. Company makes billions and then get a tiny fine. The maximum penalty by federal law is $15,138 per kid. It’s laughable.
That is absolutely ridiculous! It's bad enough that so many adult workers are struggling to make ends meet, and now you want to take advantage of kids too? These companies already exploit their workers, this would just be an even bigger slap in the face. I know for a fact that there are plenty of college students and other adults who need these jobs, why not let them have it? NoToChildExploitation.
