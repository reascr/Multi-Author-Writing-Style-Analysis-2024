The website is LGBTQ nation. I think it's entirely appropriate. Too many folks see sexual identity as a personality trait and political tool. It blatantly points out that just because a person is out and LGBTQ, it does not mean they are any better to represent you.
I think people need to understand that LGBT people have their own thoughts and will form their own opinions. We won't automatically agree with you because you're a Democrat. Our sexual orientation isn't our only issue.
I oppose DeSantis's moves against Disney for free speech reasons. In fact even as a gay man, if Disney was promoting a roght wing agenda and DeSantis was a left winger doing the same thing I'd oppose it.
I am a gay man. I am right leaning but libertarian. I agree with gay marriage and weed legalization but I disagree with Democrats on some issues. I guess I am politically homeless. I did vote for Biden in 2020 not because I liked him but because I think that Trump has little respect for the Constitution or rule of law, ( confirmed by his recent comments) and his irresponsible handling of COVID-19 and his irresponsible rhetoric and behavior on the issue.
