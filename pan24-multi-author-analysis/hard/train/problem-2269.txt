Taxation without representation is how you get your people to revolt and riot. Which is what the American revolution was fought over.
The National Anthem having God in it doesn't make it any less the National Anthem. I for one don't vote republican and just because someone disagrees with you on something doesn't make them one. So fuck off on that note child. You so far left you can't support our government and institutions then leave. Maybe go to Russia like Griner did.
I'm not empathising with Russia, I would have the same opinion with any other country. If you take drugs to a foreign country, that is on you. There is no love for Russia here lol.
What's legal in your country doesn't matter, because she isn't in your country. If she didn't want to risk this for her future, she shouldn't have taken drugs into a foreign country.
But I wouldn't bring drugs across international borders and the world is immoral, wishing it isn't is great an all but the status quo is what it is.
For real, I would never go to Russia, even pre invasion, and if I had to, I certainly wouldnâ€™t take drugs into the country. Just asking for a stay in the gulag.
