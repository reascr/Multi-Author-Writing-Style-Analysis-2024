Right, but over here (I also live in Vietnam), the medical system is also not as sturdy as in the USA. It's surprisingly good, with a variety of hospitals in different price ranges for different needs and incomes, and local hospitals/clinics available even in relatively small towns etc, but at the end of the day Vietnam is still a poor country and there's a limit to how good it can be. It's poorer than China as well, of course.
I don't get it, I feel bad for them to an extent but after a while something like emotional fatigue sets in where you're just tired of watching a close and significant neighbor fuck up constantly. Their future and economic health has implications for all of us in this part of the world. In some respects, them screwing the pooch has been very good for Vietnam in terms of industry relocating here, but with the massively interconnected nature of the regional and global economy I just feel like having such a massive economy become stagnant cannot be good long term. At the end of the day, economic activity begets economic activity, China becoming the sick man of Asia will have unpredictable and probably net-negative effects.
Thats the root cause of it—because China never had any real economy independent from multinational corporations’ factories…now they pay the price.
