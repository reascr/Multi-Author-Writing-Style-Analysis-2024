Granted, but this is for the president. I get that no man is above the law, but maybe some cases should get expedited review to clear them out of the system.
But now that these rulings are finally being finalized, they become the precedent for if the situation happens again in the future. If a future president refuses to hand over their tax info to Congress, courts can point to the rulings from Trump’s case and decide the cases a lot faster.
The thing about the legal system is that it relies upon precedence to work efficiently, as whatever ruling was given in the past case should be the same ruling given in a present case of similar circumstances. Going further, courts lower than the Supreme Court must defer to precedence in their rulings, and have to go out of their way to explain why a current situation is different than the previous ones if they try to go against the precedent.
Now with Trump, things have been taking many years to work their way through the legal system because it’s all unprecedented. There hasn’t been a situation in the past where an ex-President refused to hand over their tax information to Congress, nor has there been a situation where an ex-President refused to return classified materials to the Presidential Archives, etc etc for all of Trumps legal issues as an ex-President.
