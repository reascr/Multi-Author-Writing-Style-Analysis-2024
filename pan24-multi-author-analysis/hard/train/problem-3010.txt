Meh, it’ll be fine. Comparing it to Brexit is laughably hyperbolic… all of the squeaky wheels on Reddit complaining about implementation and sale stoppages will disappear by March, guaranteed.
I accept everything you’re saying; at the end of the day, I’m content to deal with these short-term headaches in exchange for the most sweeping and strict gun control law in the country. I agree with the points you’re saying, but the reaction I’m struck with is an overwhelming meh.
The legislature is welcome to amend the law to extend the deadline, or the courts will place a temporary injunction until the implementation questions are ironed out. As for gun businesses, I have a hard time believing that they will all close shop since the last time I checked they sold a lot more merchandise than just guns.
The gun shops sell other things, but that is manly ammunition and gun accessories. The core of their business is guns. That's like telling an auto dealership to stay in business because they also sell auto accessories in their service department.
It still doesn't fix the problem of a law being implemented with no way to not just enforce it but even handle the basic parts of it. You are required to have training to get a permit, but there is no training or even a permit process. The state police are required to have a searchable database of permits for sellers, but that doesn't exist. Realistically, as is, this law is about a year out from being able to be enacted. That doesn't even handle how bad the law is.
It's the same as many laws. The rich and connected have a way out, the broke and busy are left behind in red-tape.
