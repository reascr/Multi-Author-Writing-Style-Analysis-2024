Later, Ukraine's antisemitism and cooperation with the Nazis during World War II resulted in 1.5 million Jews being exterminated within the borders of modern-day Ukraine, fully 25% of the total killed in that genocide. This history doesn't endear the Ukrainians to Israel today.
And finally, there are hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Jews living in Russia who would instantly be in peril following an Israeli clash with Russia.
Syria is a client of Iran, who would like to establish a land bridge to Lebanon and supply Hezbollah with strategically significant armaments to create a 2-front war dilemma for Israel while it finalizes its nuclear weapons capability.
So Israel continuously attacks weapons shipments intended for Hezbollah and concentrations of Iranian forces in Syria, in close coordination with Russia to avoid causing Russian casualties and drawing it into direct conflict with Israel.
Israelâ€™s own security partly depends on its relationship with Russia, Israel needs a working relationship.
