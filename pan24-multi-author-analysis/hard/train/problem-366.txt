In my whole life, I've never heard anyone use the word "brownies" to demean POC. Other words yes, but not that particular one.
No, they didn't vote for it internally. Here is how it went down, executive suddenly informed everyone after the current session had already started that the name would change mid-session instead of for the beginning of the next session. That these are the two choices that had been pre-selected by the executive and people could vote on them and only those two choices.
Either this means I haven't been around enough racist people, or I've been around much more racist people.
Some classmates even called them that when I was around without flinching, european racism hits different.
but that is because we are racists. We are so racist, we are not even aware that eating those chewy chocolate squares (the corners are the best) is a racist endeavor. That by eating the desert, and actually enjoying it, it is like enjoying being a raging racist spewing hate everywhere. Continuing to prepare a racist recipe we received from our parents (or saw in a cookbook, or online, or bought from our 6 year old first grade bake sale - obviously a bunch of kiddie racists). See the racism is so deep it spans generations We need to ban all brownie recipies ASAP. And while we are at it, anything with the name/description chocolate, because people have been described as having chocolate colored skin.
Just asking the questions is offensive and indicates how deep the racism goes. You would prefer to be a racist instead of missing out on a sweet desert.
