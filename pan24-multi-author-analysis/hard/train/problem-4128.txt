It's all the same thing just flavored differently to be more socially acceptable. In the suburbs it's easy to get away with a MAGA flag without much pushback or ridicule from the neighbors but a Confederate flag might get the HOA up in your business and the swastika definitely will. Out in the sticks you can get away with the Confederate flag and/or a MAGA flag easily. Luckily the swastika is largely still only acceptable in right wing safe spaces for the most part. Gun shows, race tracks, homes, the occasional gun store are were they stay usually but there's always the exception.
In my area we have a few houses like that but it's mostly all Bible verses and conspiracy theory web addresses. There used to be one that just had a huge blue Q spray painted on plywood that always made me chuckle.
No by all means fucking vote. Please for love of everything vote. If anything I think the majority that are taking down their flags and removing their MAGA hats are hiding it and because they don't want to be seen as losers. Where I work is predominantly very conservative and most of them are not outwardly supporting him anymore and a good chunk, if not most, have verbally stated that he is to blame for the recent election. Make no mistake though I doubt few won't dust off their hats and flags if he gets the nomination.
Plus, let’s not act like these very same Republicans won’t be back on the Trump train if he wins the nomination. The exact same thing happened in 2016.
I live in rural Pennsylvania, and this could not be more wrong. People around here are fucking jazzed.
