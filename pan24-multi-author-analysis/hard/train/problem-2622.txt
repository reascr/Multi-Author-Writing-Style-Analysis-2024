"Qualified majority voting can lead to fairer...results for all of us," Baerbock told a conference in Portugal's capital Lisbon. "We must be capable of acting efficiently and swiftly.".
What are you on about. Every level of the EU decision making process is either directly elected by the people or appointed by the people’s representatives. It’s a representative democracy all the way down in all legislative branches.
First, because we would lose one of the most essential things in a democracy: To vote for our direct representatives and make our own legislation. I find it very scary to be Governed by some shady bureaucrat in Brussels that never presented himself to an election. Plus, how can you make efficient legislation for an entire continent if you don't know the specifics of every country or regions inside those countries?
So since National legislation (due to what's written in Constitution) already has to bend to European legislation, why don't we give up on all sovereignty?! That's a straight up dangerous line of thought.
