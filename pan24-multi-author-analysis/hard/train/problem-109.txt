They want money - pure and simple. Of course, what they want is money from the west and if the west boycotts the Olympics, you can kiss most of that sponsorship and TV money goodbye.
I think everyone in the west should boycott the Olympics if they are going to turn into something like Sochi 2014 or Berlin 1936. Maybe the Olympics run by this IOC has reached the end of their welcome in the world.
oh I have never said anything about IOC. Only stating my point of view. I know very well every great Idea or Movement in the history of mankind to bring either people together or advancing Humanity can and will be hijacked and corrupted by a group of small people just to make themselves very rich and powerfull. Be it sport or political or Socialmovement. I dont trust any Organisation or Movement that has gain great influence over the world.
As a child I was told the olympic is for bring people together and to settle difference aside on the Sportfield instead of on the battlefield. So for me, its only natural, that anyone who choose the battlefield should be banned from the sportfield till they stop their war of aggression.
As a child i was more worried if i had found the best stick in the wood and if i could watch tv cartoon at sunday. But i get your point. I am, as an adult, not surprised but i am still disappointed. Though none of those 2 Aggression or act of war was an open invasion with the goal of annexing land, erasing culture and eradicating civil population like the russian is doing. So mind you, we are speaking of 2 complete different kind of evil. Its like comparing robbery to Genozids. Both are bad, but one is clearly worse than the other.
