Ukrainian cities have been absolutely devastated and thousands are dead due to Russia's invasion. Please don't make light of the potential harm they can do and also don't make light of just how much effort and material the Ukrainians are expending in order to defend themselves. Just because Russia has shown themselves to be fairly inept does not mean they won't still murder thousands of Poles when they level whole city blocks with artillery and missiles.
Bringing up nukes and trying to say that they should make us fearful of defending ourselves if Russia attacks just sounds like a very weak Russian talking point.
I fail to see how Russia having nukes should have any impact on whether a western country should defend itself.
Similarly, NATO won't make Ukraine a member while it is in active conflict because it will trigger a nuke war that NATO can't win.
I think that if they can’t beat only Ukraine after a year, it’s safe to say they definitely have no hope of starting a war with NATO and winning.
Why would you think they could attack a NATO country with ten times the equipment, better trained soldiers and allies than Ukraine, after what we've seen in Ukraine? You do realize how much they're already struggling to find men and equipment right?
