If you honestly think that, after seeing this play out so many times before, Trump will ever see the inside of a courtroom or even be officially charged with a crime, I have some warm beachfront property on Mars you may be interested in.
You're right. He suffered when the Mueller report was released, listing at least 10 different crimes he committed, which led to......exactly nothing because of a decades old memo. Then there was the airtight case in SDNY, which was notorious for not bowing to political pressure. He's going to be on trial for.....wait, the DA decided not to pursue charges. Never mind. And there was the Cohen case. Trump's personal fixer. Surely, Cohen's testimony is going to lead to.......an "unindicted co-conspirator" being the mastermind behind it all.
NY Courts: "Michael Cohen worked at the direction of an unindicted co-conspirator who coincidentally just happened to become the 45th president of the United States. He will continue to go officially unnamed, and we are not pursuing criminal charges at this time.".
Right. All along. You're not letting the process work as it is supposed to. You're trying to call the game over while it is still just getting going.
