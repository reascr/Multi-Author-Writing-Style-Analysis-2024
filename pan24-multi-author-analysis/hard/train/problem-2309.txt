Amsterdam is welcome to keep their red light district and the associated industries they just need to move it away from the city center and away from residential neighborhoods.
Moving the red light district isn't going to remove tourists who disrespect the downtown neighborhoods of Amsterdam though. That's just what happens in heavily touristed cities... have you been to Paris, London, NYC, LA? Vegas, which has legal brothels outside the major districts like youre saying, is probably the worst of all when it comes to shitty tourists. They don't just stay at the brothels-- they spend most of their time treating the city as a playground.
Ultimately this is a conflict between needing tourists for the economy and residents not wanting tourists for their own peace-- very little to do with having a red light district in the city center. As long as the brothel reputation exists somewhere, those people will keep coming-- and because Amsterdam is such a small condensed city, those people will end up downtown behaving like tourists on vacation.
And while Amsterdam could probably thrive without that tourism, it would still be a big hit to accommodate to. I believe most of Amsterdams tourists are weekenders who come specifically because of the vices it freely offers.
