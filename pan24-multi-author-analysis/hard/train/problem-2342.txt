What is with this obsession over balance or "global equilibrium"? What good is that balance if achieving it means accepting deep immorality? Doesn't the world need justice instead of this bullshit?
Furthermore, Donbas is in Ukraine. Why does Russia have a right to police what happens in Ukraine? According to you there is no international law, therefore Russia has no concerns in Ukraine.
Do you also think the EU and NATO are “destabilising” Russia because they put sanctions on them for invading Ukraine?
People keep saying that but no one thinks that when Ukraine does conceed territory (or not), they can join NATO and it's end game.
The russians feel the same as you, the west is against us so its moral to defend ourselves by invading ukraine before it joins nato.
There were plenty of reasons to invade ukraine, for example its against the international law you defend to enter an alliance that would destabilize a region, like ukraine entering nato. Ukraine has bombed civilians for 8 years and keeps doing it, so since that is inmoral should we neither support ukrain or russia?
There are few things in life as reliable as Russian shills claiming Ukraine has been murdering innocents in Donbas. But, lets suppose for a second that was true, which it is not. Russia could have appealed to the UN and requested a security force to protect the region, or it could have used its allegedly superior air defense (lol) to shoot down the alleged bombings from Ukraine. It did neither. Instead, it gave weapons to Igor Girkin and others who promptly used them to blow up an airliner. Then Russia committed to an ill fated invasion of all of Ukraine, not just the Donbas, which is currently not going so well.
What good will it be if the regions which really don't feel like ukrainian (Crimea and deep Donbass) are returned to Kyiv's control ?
