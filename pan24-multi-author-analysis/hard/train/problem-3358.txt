My dad always goes off on rants about Biden Vs Trump. I tried to tell him that there were these suspected balloons when Trump was in office too. The conversation went like this...
ME: " I think Trump did absolutely nothing, turned the other cheek on purpose because he has real estate in China, and other business dealings. Trump probably tried to make $$ in China, and didn't want to strain relations, because all Trump cares about is what HE gets out of it.".
Well. The last president didn't care about hearing about much. The information could have very well been in briefings but it's common knowledge that it was difficult, to say the least, to get him to listen. He was easily bored.
Also, it's not like they traveled back in time to get the information. The information on the previous balloons was available for anyone who cared to look.
Now they're comparing the track the UFO against that of the current balloons and that's how they realized that they matched.
Because the previous balloons were reported/marked as UFO. They then used intelligence of the one they found and backtracked the previous intelligence to connect the dots for potential previous breaches of airspace.
