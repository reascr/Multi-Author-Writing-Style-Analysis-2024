The chances are good that the Russian armed forces either aren't keeping records of where they've been dropping ordnance, or they're failing to communicate those records to units in the area. From what we've seen so far, my money would be on a combination both.
You don't really "lay" butterfly mines (or other Scatmin) as such. You deploy them via airburst munitions and they scatter indiscriminately over a wide area.
Butterfly mines are designed to be able to be dropped over an area from an aircraft without detonating on impact, which means they can be deployed indiscriminately. They also are antipersonnel mines and are triggered with 5kg of force applied to them, which theoretically means a child could trigger one, as opposed to anti-vehicle mines which typically require at least 100kg of force to go off. Lastly, they are made with plastic frangible components rather than metal which, while having a lower chance of killing a person, will seriously maim them and make treating the injuries mine-clearing after the conflict much more difficult (metal shrapnel can be spotted on an X-ray with a metal detector while plastic shards cannot).
