A non-binding referendum is, legally speaking, not binding. It can therefore be assumed that such a referendum must have some utility beyond a mandate made to the government. Can we layfolk think of one? What about a process to solicit feedback in the form of personal responses to a spitball proposal? What about a way to ask the public if it's worthwhile committing to research into a particular proposal when said research would utilize significant government resources and incur significant costs (to be covered by taxpayers)?
What actually happened was an absolutely pathetic and miserable abdication of duty. The government did not function whatsoever. It fell into the trap of bureaucracy and did what the referendum dictated despite not being bound by the results just because a slight margin said to do it, with nowhere near a complete appreciation for the actual consequences or even how deep the UK's fingers really were in the EU cookie jar. The buffoons rubber stamped Brexit.
Its because Brexit or undoing Brexit etc. is political wildfire. Even if they are right whats the solution? pointing out Boris is a moron? or trying to undo it because the British public won't like that either.
A lot of people said NHS funding but lets be honest what they really meant is they hate certain types of people.
You are completely correct but that doesn't mean politicians will want to raise the matter. Punishing and/or criticizing these thieves isn't politically advantageous.
