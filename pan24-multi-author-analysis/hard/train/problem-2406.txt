I don't think so man, Trump said if he lost "you won't hear from me again" and look what's going on? Not sure why he said that when he knew it wasn't going to be true. He is so deep in the narcissist pool he believes he did nothing wrong so there is no need for a pardon. He's going to run whether the GOP want him or not. His ego is so inflated that he thinks he can win. Unless of course it's "rigged" again.
"It was rigged. I actually won. Ted cheated." All that shit. It's crazy, he's only got one fucking note.
He's gonna go nuclear. He's 80, wears diapers, has an adderall addiction, is functionally illiterate, and is gonna pitch the mother of all hissy fits when he isn't picked to run for president.
I don’t think he’d run as a third party if he doesn’t get the nomination but he will sure as shit do everything in his power to sabotage anyone who beats him.
Man, forget Trump running as an independent; if he doesn't get the nomination I fully expect his goons to storm the RNC and name him the nominee anyway.
