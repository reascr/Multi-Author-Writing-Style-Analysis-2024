The Democratic Party's big split was between its Establishment wing and its conservative wing (which was really just a handful of persons but enough so that it mattered in the Senate). The "Progressive" wing of the party just doesn't exist. They have no real fight. Nancy does a good enough job preserving an image on unity by ensuring that nothing even sniffs the House floor without enough votes, which may be good for the Democratic Party as an institution, but it is bad for democracy as a whole because the voters never get to see where their Congresscritters stand on certain matters. And the Omnibus bills are also great for PR purposes because the media can run stories about how politician x opposed bill proposing policy y while conveniently leaving out policies a-w that are also in the bill.
Yeah. That's usually how it works. You unite to deny the opposition power, but now that the opposition isn't in power, you have to deny the majority of the coalition power.
Democrats also fractured when they gained power, just not as much because they're minority factions aren't that influential.
The one and only positive of the Republicans retaking the House is that the public will see how dysfunctional the Republican party has become. Driven by the insane conspiracy theories of their base, beholden to big money oligarchs, constant infighting, inability to govern constructively. A competitive primary for president in 2024 will only bring out the fissures even more. I can't wait.
