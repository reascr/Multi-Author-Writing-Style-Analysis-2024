Also, Republicans consistently poll terribly among Millennials and Gen Z, who see Cons as scary, bigoted, and hostile to every political policy (climate change, taxing the wealthy, government funded healthcare, corporate accountability, etc) both demographics care about. Not to mention the Cons offer these demographics absolutely nothing of worth, policy wise. This could change if they move toward the Left and start trying to be real policy makers, but they had that chance after Romney lost to Obama and chose to double-down on BS.
I think there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic! The Republican Party his hardly unified anymore. MAGA/Q-Nuts are currently at war with “moderate” Republicans who want to put Trump & co. in their rear view mirror. That’s good news for the Dems who want to cripple Republican policies while getting juicy soundbites demonstrating how incapable the Right is at basic governance.
Ah yes, because it's Democrats who want a dysfunctional government, not the Republicans who have been dismantling government for decades...? (Are you on drugs?).
Yes. But all of what you say depends on free and fair elections as the natural consequences leading to their political marginalization. We're dealing with people who only believe in democracy if they win, will cheat or use violence and threats of violence to "win", and who are heavily armed and have thoroughly infiltrated the military and police.
