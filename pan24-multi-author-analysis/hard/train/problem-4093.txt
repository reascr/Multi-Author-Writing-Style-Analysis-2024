Let’s keep in mind a lot of this aid is part of a military budget. And the American military budget is bigger than like everyone else combined. Maybe not that much but it’s a lot.
Sure, it does. While Trump is in Ohio visiting Americans in need, Biden is in Ukraine checking on the progress of our proxy war with Russia.
To be fair, the Optics of Biden going to Ukraine before visiting Ohio are really bad. Biden had a lot of time to make a quick trip to Ohio and show his concern. When Trump travels to Ohio on Wednesda, he's going to really gain a lot of publicity and negative publicity for Biden.
Biden could easily stay out of the working area and meet with some of the families. Whether the governor invites him or not is immaterial .
Yup, no problem at all with a President overriding a state governor in his own state. Fuck federalism and constituational powers, Biden needs to make a political statement. Sometimes being strong means ignoring legal restrictions. The constitution is just a piece of paper, anyway.
