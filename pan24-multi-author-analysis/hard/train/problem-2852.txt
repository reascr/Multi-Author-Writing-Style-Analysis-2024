We should put pregnant women in prison. Anything less than that is giving them time and opportunity to get an abortion. Everybody knows all pregnant women want to do is to get an abortion and need to be physically restrained to keep from doing it.
How is it pro-life to not protect pregnant women's ability to access water, seats, etc. during the workday? Not having those things threatens your ability to carry a baby to term.
To me, pro-life is a higher standard than anti-choice, and requires that the politician be concerned about policies that actually help people conceive, carry, and support children, physically and economically. Universal pre-k, universal healthcare, paid family leave... all of these policies are pro-life, but not necessarily anti-choice.
They are not pro life, pro life would be against the death penalty, for universal health care, for feeding and housing the poor, for workers getting a living wage. They are anti-abortion or anti-choice period.
No they don't get to falsely call themselves pro life, republicans consistently vote to cut spending on healthcare, food and housing for poor people. Things that people NEED to maintain life, so no they don't get to label themselves as pro life the best they can call themselves is anti abortion.
