The Abrams also has Chobham armour but to a lesser extent than the Challenger. I still wouldn’t fuck with any Western MBT if I had a choice.
Meanwhile the Russians are still using 60’s/70’s cold war era tanks, as well as using them incorrectly with no infantry or air support.
The German tanks probably have better optics too and will likely wreck the Russian tanks too, it’s a shame it took so long to send them.
It’s kind of surreal seeing almost the same tanks matching up in a war 35 years later. I’m sure Russia watched the gulf war footage and know these tanks are really bad news for them lol.
I’m going to take a guess and say Russia will announce in the next few days that they destroyed twice as many tanks as have been said are being sent even before they arrive.
EDIT: But man, I can't wait to see the UAF just utterly wipe their own ass with the Russian forces even further with these tanks. The Russians have absolutely no answer to them, if the UAF use them with the right tactics with infantry and IFV's.
Losses are inevitable. We have all seen pictures and videos of these tanks burning when mis-used. They are not invincible, and those of us that have operated with or near them know that.
