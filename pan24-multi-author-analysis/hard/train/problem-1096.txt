If the financial disincentive to have kids wasn’t there at all I think you might see a bit of a bump in fertility.
Ya I agree but with the way everything is, people that may want kids won't because it will never be a financially sound idea.
However, I think it's impossible that we could comfortably afford a good retirement and a child. She wants three. I wouldn't feel comfortable. I came from a very poor home that had lots of death, financial burden and piss poor financial planning. It's awful to see how many low income families in the 18-25 year old range that desperately want, and have kids then can't afford them through no fault of their own. My mum doesn't seem to understand that no, a single mum can't raise two children by themselves on state benefits. It's unbelievably tight. Especially with the pressures of modern society.
It's funny. My partner (28) and I (29) differ so much on this. We earn probably £65k pre-tax together, pay about £420 a month in mortgage (up north where property prices are cheaper), have our energy bill fixed at a good rate so we pay about £65 a month etc.
