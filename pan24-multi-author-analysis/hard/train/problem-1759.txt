Registration is terrific. But there still appears to be a huge gap between "registered to vote" and "actually voting".
"Registered young people who don't actually vote" is still a HUGE population, and that group not voting may literally cost us our democracy.
It amazes me that, without exception, every election cycle in my life has been tainted by younger generations reeing about how we need term limits because old people are ruining the country and they still don't vote lol.
Gen Z isn't going to do much, I'm guessing, because usually younger people don't vote as much AND I get major apathy/we're already fucked vibes from gen z (for good reason, but I wish they'd vote anyhow just in case it might help).
Millennials and Gen Z together could outvote Boomers and Gen X (and we're about 50-50 Dem/GOP) if they wanted to.
I’m 47 so I’m getting close to just being considered “the olds.” Just letting you know this Gen Xer and many like me are all voting blue down ballot. Wouldn’t it be great if these influencers finally do something worthwhile and help get out the vote!?
