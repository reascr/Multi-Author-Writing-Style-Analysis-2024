And yet at the same time, we apparently can’t hold politicians accountable for silly little things like blatant fraud, because “well, they all lie, so you’d have to arrest all of them” gotta love that doublespeak 🙄.
Right. I guess my thing is, maybe it’s time to tailor our approach to the real world that we actually live in, not the idealistic one that people wish existed.
Because really? We’re seriously at the point where someone can just blatantly lie about their entire life, hide their criminal history from another country (where the case is still open), get elected to Congress, and still be allowed to take the seat, and there’s no recourse other than hoping and praying that the people who live in that seat see anything wrong with it? When this guy likely committed several crimes in the process (lying on campaign disclosure forms, for starters). What kind of country are we running here?
And then there’s the unspoken truth that if he were a Democrat, he would have been forced to resign by now, investigations would be pending, etc.
Ok, so you catch him before he takes office, yet still nothing is done and he will continue forward as a “typical” politician that lies, cheats and steals for a career.
I don't think we can hold Republicans accountable for anything because the people who elect them don't even care if they lie, cheat, or steal, as long as it's their team that's doing it.
