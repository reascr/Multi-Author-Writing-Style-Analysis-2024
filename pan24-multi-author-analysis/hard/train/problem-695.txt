I disagree. The religions themselves are absurd. Just read the stuff in there, it's ridiculous on its face. I've read most of the Christian bible and didn't find anything in there that was particularly intellectual. It's mostly ignorance of science, superstition, mixed with control over the people.
There have certainly been religious people who have made contributions, but I believe that is in spite of religion, not because of it.
Well in my opinion, the first contribution you could make is to stop excusing religion and pontificating on all the things you think it's doing right.
As far as things religions have "incidentally gotten right" I have to disagree. Most of the world has been religious since the beginning of recorded history, and we've seen progress constantly on a macro scale. Have those religions been weaponized for political purposes? Yes. But overall, the most advanced nations have centralized religion in common as a political mechanism. The biggest lapses in progress, particularly in human rights and mass executions/apathetic starvation, in the last 200 years have come from countries that did away with religion completely.
Nope! Very much an atheist. You can hold a position on religion and still respect the position of others without reducing them to a stereotype that matches your own preconceived notions of varying groups that comprise hundreds of millions of humans across the planet.
