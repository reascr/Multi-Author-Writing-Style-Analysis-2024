Meanwhile he couldn't even stop himself from having to seize the spotlight during Covid from his own experts even though he made a complete idiot of himself.
Very much this. It's not just that he won't be getting money, he'll no longer be center stage in the spotlight. He'll be Bush, pushed offscreen and forgotten except when they need someone to blame for bad things that happened (but that they can't easily just blame on Democrats). And he knows that, too.
Yes, I know what I said. Still, Desantis' abuses of power and rake-stepping don't compare to Trump's.
Second, Desantis sees what the rest of the non cult GOP sees: Trump is a millstone weighing down Republican chances at regaining the power they had after '16. He drives more Democratics and Trump-tired independents to the polls. Desantis' chances at the oval diminish if he's on a Trump ticket.
I believe Trump has some dirt on DeSantis. I would love to have that thrown around. But what would really do the world favours would be if Trump were to some how manage to derail Fox News and its viewership.
