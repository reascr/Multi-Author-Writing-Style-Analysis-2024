Yup. The problem revolves around the question "Everyone needs a place to live, so what are they gonna do if you jack up their rent?".
> In their book, Homelessness Is a Housing Problem, the University of Washinon professor Gregg Colburn and the data scientist Clayton Page Aldern demonstrate that “the homelessness crisis in coastal cities cannot be explained by disproportionate levels of drug use, mental illness, or poverty.”.
In theory competition could drive down prices. But given that hedge funds are being used to buy up all the housing, that's not really a factor.
Yes, housing or rent prices are obviously the issue. Problem is the solution is complex, costly, and involves all levels of government, none of which are coordinated on this. Plus the profit seeking from big businesses and their control over housing gets in the way of any effort to help poorer people.
There's also the dilemma of making a place both desirable to live in but also affordable at the same time. Often the more desirable you make it the less affordable it becomes. Either way we'd need some pretty widespread zoning reform, affordable housing investments, and stopping big businesses from owning homes.
