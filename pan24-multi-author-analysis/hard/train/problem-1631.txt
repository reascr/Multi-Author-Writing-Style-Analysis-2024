The issue they’ve had is their domestically produced vaccines were kind of crap, and their elderly were largely not vaccinated.
Eh if their vaccines didn't suck ass they probably could have dealt with zero covid policy much better. Not that I agree with it but something like 50% of the efficacy as the western ones, at least their initial vaccines.
They would have avoided it if they hadn’t been stupid and accepted the better vaccines. Theirs are almost worthless. If they had rolled those out, slowly letting different areas out, I think we would have seen a totally different outcome. But they never even got a better vaccine and just gave up and let everyone out at once.
They’re vaccinated with a completely worthless vaccine. The lockdown started so they could develop a better one, they wouldn’t accept better ones from other countries due to stubbornness, so this is what happened.
That’s not true. Most people died of Covid via pneumonia. Omicron doesn’t attack the lung tissue as much as the rest of the variants, at least Omicron.1 didn’t.
