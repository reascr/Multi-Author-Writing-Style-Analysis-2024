McConnell literally got burned as recently as 2021, Senate Republicans pulled the same shit and Democrats didn’t back down. McConnell ended up being forced to back down and even agreed to a one time temporary filibuster exemption for the debt ceiling so that way Democrats can raise it without a single Republican vote. When it comes to the debt ceiling Democrats have actually shown to have a backbone and more often than not the public sides with them.
Even if the debt ceiling is first introduced and passed in the House first it can still get filibustered in the Senate, there’s no exemption to that. McConnell’s point was more so that any deal him and Democrats in the Senate strike will go nowhere in the House, that’s why he wants the House to start it because whatever the House passes has a better chance in passing in the Senate than vice versa.
It'll go to the last second and, when McCarthy isn't allowing a passed Senate bill (that would end the crisis) to even hit the floor for a vote - when he knows the Dems would have some very moderate conservatives looking to avoid default and vote for it... Those same GOP members will call for the vote to remove him. He shouldn't have accepted the rule change that lets them a single person call for it if he didn't want to be removed like that.
Luckily, the same rule the extreme crazies called for to agree to McCarthy would allow a single House member to call a vote to remove McCarthy in that situation.
If the alt crazies refuse to govern, it only takes like 4 or 5 GOP moderates to cross the aisle to remove McCarthy, vote in a moderate Speaker, and end the crisis.
McCarthy has already demonstrated that he cares more about placating the crazies in his party, and the rank-and-file GOP has also shown they are willing to go along.
