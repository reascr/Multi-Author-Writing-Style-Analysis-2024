Itâ€™s a major fucking deal though. Any normalizing even in the tiniest degree of missiles infringing in foreign airspace will be taken advantage of by Russia.
Drawing attention to the incident in Poland was just to point out, that by the logic of blindly wanting to go to war over a stray missile, Nato should already been drawn into the war on Russia's side. Not saying that is what NATO should do, but rather how ridiculous an non-nuanced take is.
Also If Ukraine hasn't declared War on Russia for literally invading their country. A rocket flying over another country isn't going to cause war declaration.
No country is going to declare war or call in Article 5 over a stray missile crossing over into their territory.
Or denying it because accepting that a missile crossed their air space and landed on their territory means they might need to call article 5 thus bringing a direct confrontation Nato-russia.
as you bemoaning the fact missiles not landing in foreign territory so that NATO could declare war. Hence my aggressive tone. given this response It seems this was wrong and that you were just correcting a typo.
