Facebook disinformation campaigns and troll farms really did work their magic here. Elders that remember the dark days of the last Marcos regime have made public outcries, but Marcos’ supporters deny this and call his family’s reign as a ‘golden era’ despite his family declaring martial law, stealing money from the masses, and leaving the Philippine people in shambles.
The sheer disillusionment of the broken promise of People Power is also a factor, a promise of prosperity that never manifested more than half a century has stewed resentment in the country, in fact during the mid-2010's the slow descent of respect for the Aquinos(while also having issues of their own) who's patriarch's death was the catalyst for the ousting of Marcos, pretty much foreshadowed the Marcoses efforts in changing public perception and history.
Not helping is that the previous popular president Duterte (who's charisma as an asshole means his supporters ignore all of his faults, something similar to Trump) being a supporter of Marcos himself which gave the family the chance to be taken seriously again.
Even my own father got in on the whole Marcos thing cause he bought into the Duterte cult of personality who supported the asshole, he even warned my mother not to vote for the opposition. Now that the Marcos are in power though, they're in the seat that people shit on since they have to deal with the aftermath of Covid and the inflation issue and their supporters are either on the defensive or just ignore reality and sit on their little bubble ignoring the burning building, bad news though is that Marcos seems to be still focusing on PR instead of any work that can alleviate all these issues, he's also imitating Duterte's foreign policy of ambiguously sucking off both China and the U.S., depending on who's the lesser threat like some crackwhore who's choosing which STD to get.
Filipinos in general have massive presence online, but they aren't exactly savvy and are so easily affected by disinformation. My own aunt is basically not on speaking terms with her own sisters(including my mother) since she's a Marcos supporter, EVEN though my grandparents suffered through the martial law and hated the Marcoses(this aunt of mine was too young back then to remember but my mom still remembers the days of hellish curfew and the police brutality that was common back then).
