See how dumb that is? Why does Texas have the right to blame everyone else for their own problems? Oh, right, because it's not so much a problem as it is a chance to politicize this issue, demonize non-white people, and attack democrats.
"In Feburary, the Mayor of Buffalo waited until a day below freezing in Texas. He began to truck down mountains of snow and dump them in the middle of major intersections, and into the driveway of Texas lawmakers. 'Why do we have to deal with snow? It's not fair that Texas is warmer. They either need to step up and help us with our snow and other weather issues, or we'll keep dumping snow down there until they listen.'".
Yea. For real. As another user pointed out, the Gov. can call a special session at any time, but it's typically reserved for emergencies and used to extend the sessions in years they are already meeting.
(I have to point this out because of how fucking stupid it is these jackasses only work every other year.).
Yeah. Bill shit. No more money to these states who didnâ€™t use COVID money, education money or any federal money for its intended purpose. We need more accountability.
