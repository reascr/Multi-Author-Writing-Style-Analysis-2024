Or a politician has to compromise with other politicians, so that each get half of what they want. Rarely does one politician have absolute power to get everything he wants, even if you vote for him. You have to understand election promises as promises to try their best.
Even a responsible politician will sometimes not be able to fulfill all their promises. For example Obama wanted to close Guantanamo, and as far as I can tell did his best, but was blocked by Congress.
