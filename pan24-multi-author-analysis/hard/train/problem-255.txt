My grandfather wasnâ€™t born here though. Fam is from Catania. We go back and visit a few times a year and I canâ€™t understand a lick of what theyâ€™re saying. Alas. ðŸ¥².
Wow. It's called Olanda in Romania, so it's a common mistake to make when switching to English. Hell, I've even seen Dutch people refer to the Netherlands as Holland. And regardless, saying "opinion disregarded" to someone who's complaining about discrimination because they got a name wrong is really shitty.
Not that these things have anything to do with Schengen accession, for which the criteria are very clear and fully met, but still, it's always nice to refute a racist's misconceptions.
It's middle of the road for a European state in these regards. Its government corruption is about on the same level as the UK in recent years (low-level corruption however in e.g. courts and hospitals is still an issue), and its organised crime is significantly lower than in e.g. France and Italy, and just a bit better than Croatia.
Racist who is literally right now trying to repeat the same lies about us not being "ready" to join Schengen in a different thread recognises himself in a comment that doesn't refer to individuals but the many racists in those countries, who are unfortunately representing the country as a whole through their government's decisions, and bleats that he's being discriminated by being called racist. A classic.
