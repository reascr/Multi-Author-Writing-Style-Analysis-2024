After he was elected in 2016, I remember talking to my dad about how this will all end with him representing himself at his criminal trials, after his presidency.
I predict he'll unambiguously call for violence the day before he gets arrested, and the fallout will be so disgusting to everyone in the country that he'll have trouble finding lawyers. Or, he'll refuse to hire anyone permanently as one-by-one they explain how fucked he is because he's admitted to all his crimes and intentions in public.
No, they can't, not unless he's already been involuntarily committed or agrees to testing (he won't if he knows they're looking for incompetence).
Trump remembers how he fucked over his own father after Fred was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. No way would he agree to anything that would lead to guardianship.
He is a hardcore narcissist. He's not going to allow anyone on 'his' team to argue that he is weak and unable to control himself. He has to feel he's on top of everything and he can fix things.
"He can never accept reality that is unacceptable for him. Normal people, we all have losses. Trump doesn't have losses. So he denies it. When it comes down to it, if you push him hard enough, which is what has happened, then you see the delusional core of it. It has all the qualities of a delusion.".
That said, . May he be in hell one day; always on the other side of a locked soundproof door leading to the S&M dungeon.
