You have a point.but you have to realize a F22 capture would send Russia ahead decades technically. We knew javelins would be stolen from Ukrainian forces .but that tech is a drop in the bucket compared to the gap between us and Russian weaponry.a modern Abrams or god forbid a top their drone would make them horribly more of a threat in the future. It's bad and cruddy towards Ukraine I know.but we have to think about the next wars,cuz Russia WILL START OTHER WARS .
I have a hard time beliving NATO would cold turkey Ukraine even if they found out it was them. Ukraine would fall immedietly and Russia would suddenly be their new neighbor. They would most likely pile it on Russia, use it as an excuse for further sanctions and more military support.
I got called crazy for saying Ukraine could have intentionally shot that Russian Missle into Poland in order to rally support for more air defense systems ( that they have been asking for months now).
That would never happen. This war is not about helping Ukraine. Its about stoping the biggest Nuclear Power in the world and the West main adversary from growing in power. Poland does not want Russia as a neighbor I can promise you that.
