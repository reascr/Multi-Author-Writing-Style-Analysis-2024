The DNC doesn't have dedicated propaganda channels like the GOP does. Makes getting any messages or petty hard especially when networks try to "both sides" every damn thing thinking that's what legit news does.
"Democrats say the sky is blue. But in a stunning upset several prominent Republicans say it's green. Tune is at 6 Eastern Time for an interview with a Republican Senator to hear their reasoning.".
Yeah. Why is this even a question? All presidents do this without even asking. Take away the burden of proof when Republicans claim he never committed tax fraud.
If Trump’s tax info reveals that he lied to the American people, would you prefer not to know about it?
I'd guess the odds are really good that Trump has been lying to the IRS just like he's been lying to banks, creditors, and everyone else.
Trump Org was recently found guilty on numerous counts of criminal tax fraud, so it’s a little hard to buy the feigned ignorance of how Trump’s name could possibly be associated with shady business practices.
So, assuming those returns are full of lies, and further, assuming that it would take a considerable amount of time for forensic accountants to untangle the web of lies...would there be value in releasing tax returns that falsely show Trump to be wealthier than he is with no debts of concern?
If Trump’s tax documents don’t contain anything damning, then he has nothing to fear from their being made public, as has been the case for every other modern President.
