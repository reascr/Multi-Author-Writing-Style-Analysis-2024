The tribalism is not helping America. It's only dividing us further. Democrats complained about everything Trump did (rightfully or not), and now they seem to be upset when Republicans complain about everything Biden does.
Democrats complaining about the terrible policy decisions of Trump vs. Republicans complaining that Biden didn't drop something the size of 3 busses over a populated area... yeah that's the same thing.
Republicans don't know how any of these decisions work, and the ones who do know are attacking Biden to score political points.
GOP don’t care… they don’t have solutions, they’re not interested in good governance, they whine and criticize and then fuck it all up completely when they’re in charge and lie about it the whole time.
Wednesday: Republicans criticize Biden for not running the mostly full dishwasher after putting coffee cup in it.
Friday: Republicans slam Biden for ‘environmental hypocrisy’ as he wastes tax payer dollars on running big government dishwashers that are only half full of dishes.
