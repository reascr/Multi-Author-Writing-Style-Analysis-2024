I finally said screw them, and have taken back Our flag! I'm anticipating that some maga idiot will mistake me for one of their own...at which point I'll have some verbal fun.
I was angry that tgey seem to have confiscated the flag....for quite some time I was hesitant to fly the US FLAG or wear anything 'patriotic' for fear of looking like a right wing idiot.
But needless to say those who do literally drape themselves in our flag are generally the ones who don’t seem to like anything it represents, ironically.
And an abundance of american/canadian flags now directly indicates that the person is an unpatriotic traitor to the flag.
The utter irony is that there used to be a responsibility for using the American flag. It needs to be raised at dawn and come down at dusk. It should never be allowed to touch the ground. It’s only folded in a certain way.
If I did not know better I would call it hubris. Except I am sure the large % of these moms would not know the meaning….
More to the point, if I don’t believe in God I am still an American, and as a fellow American it is a “citizens” right and responsibility to defend my right to believe that way….
