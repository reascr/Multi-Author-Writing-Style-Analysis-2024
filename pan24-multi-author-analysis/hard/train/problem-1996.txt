Isn't one's "fair share" what the tax laws of the US government say you owe?The issue here is the tax code and all the BS loopholes wealthy people like Trump can rely upon to pay next to nothing. Ultimately the government is supposed to dictate what everyone's fair share is via the tax code and that has clearly failed here.
Would be nice if something positive would actually come from Trump's existence like galvanizing support to eliminate the types of tax loopholes he exploits....but I won't hold my breath.
Let’s be honest, don’t be mad at Trump, he followed the law (questionable for sure), but we really need to evaluate the “tax laws” and all the loopholes that never seem to be closed.
No, there is probably not another tax return in the country as complex as Trumps, this isn't just taking advantage of the rules, this is tax fraud(hasn't been proven yet, but that's what the author is talking about).
I have no doubt Trump cheated on taxes, absolutely zero, but I think the author is still overselling it.
This is not tax advice, if you don't qualify as a professional gambler none of this applies, consult your tax professional.
