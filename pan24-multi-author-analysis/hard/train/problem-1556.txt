As for vessel Owners, well the freight rates are sky rocketing. It used to be about 600k usd to take a 30kt cargo from russian black sea to ARA range. Now it's over 3.5 million. They are totaly in control and if you want your cargo moved, you are forced to pay this freight rate. Offcourse those costs are passed to you and me.
Once the transfere is done, and the russian cargo is now mixed with the original cargo of the mother ship, the owners of the cargo can request the chamber of commerce (a relevant CoC authority, it cannot be a CoC from the UK when the ship is sitting in the territorial water of let's say Spain, it has to be a Spanish CoC). The CoC the issues a certificate of origin as Spanish origin...
As someone who had been in the oil industry for over a decade, I can tell you it's the most corrupt industry, only second to the vessel owners.
Its the biggest source of corruption and nepotism in the region (see Petrobras, Pemex, Ecopetrol,etc...).
The difference is nationalizing it leads to corruption of nations and bad nation states. The government isn't holding oil accountable if the government owns oil...this is real life where there's actual bad people.
