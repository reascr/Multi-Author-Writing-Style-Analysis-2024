That's false, there are several factions involved in the Yemen Civil War. There's the Iranian-backed Houthis, the Saudi-backed government of al-Alimi, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, more independent groups such as the Hadhramaut Tribal Alliance then of course Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS-"Yemen Province", the latter two fight against all the rest and they also fight each other.
Houthi Rebels representing Houthis that have been historically been oppressed and are currently being genocided, responsible for overthrowing an unelected government propped up by the Saudis in the Arab Spring.
The Saudi bombing campaign has been atrocious, but there's still legitimate reasons to support the UN recognized Yemeni government over the Houthi movement.
It's horrible what's happening in Yemen, but don't start pretending those murderous bastards are some sort of freedom loving local heroes.
Houthis arent fighting for freedom, they're an extremist terrorist group backed by Russia, Iran and North Korea.
