Honestly I think they’ll be able to do it cheaper with high volume computer assisted machine gun fire or computer guided anti drone electronic warfare weapons.
Thanks to their range they'd be far better at providing AA coverage, they'd basically be one shot kill weapons vs a drone and drones should be well within their targeting capabilities given the speeds involved.
However, i do believe that to counter drones, one does not require missiles, but anti-air guns/flak cannons, which i would imagine is much cheaper than a missile (that can track a target). Therefore, it is essential to develop ground based tracking, gun-based anti-air. The amount of bullets spent to blow the drones up must be made cheaper than the drones themselves, or it's a losing battle.
Drones don’t move super fast - nothing like a missile so I figure it’s a matter of time before someone figures out how to destroy them cheaper and quicker…. Just like everything else.
Most air based defence platforms have IFF capabilities (wondering about Russias tho) that’ll tell you if it’s friend or foe.
I wouldn't be surprised if the US still has some VADS (same gun as CIWS/LPWS) in storage, hell, the JASDF still uses them for airfield close defence. Sure, the LPWS can intercept mortar shells (which I doubt the VADS can), but if it's drones that we're concerned about then that is also an option/supplement.
