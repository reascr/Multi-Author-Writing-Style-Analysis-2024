Just make sure to use pillows to support your knees when sleeping on your side and it won't be a problem. a Pillow between the legs, and hugging another one will greatly help prevent shoulder and knee pain.
edit: PS, I discovered i had a lot of knee pain from sleeping on my side. Popping my knees and then making myself fall asleep on stomach or back made my knee pain completely disappear.
That helps for sure but it's still difficult to find a perfect alignment when sleeping on your side, your knees are resting (and rebuilding bone) slightly to the left or slightly to the right.
Just to comment on another commenter's post, sleeping with a pillow between your legs helps, but it's still going to be slightly wider or narrower knee angle than normal posture. Your body is regenerating bone slowly but surely all the time, if you spend long periods with your knees slightly to the left or right or a natural alignment, the problem and discomfort will build over time. A pillow between the legs helps but the best solution is popping your knees so you know they are in a completely natural alignment and then falling asleep in this position. Falling asleep on my back was really difficult at first. I found a couple heavy pillows on my chest (while laying on my back) helped a lot. I was a side sleeper too, with or without pillows between my knees, and eventually discovered sleeping at least 40% of the time on my back or stomach made a world of difference. I have virtually no knee pain anymore and rarely feel the urge to pop my knees anymore. Ymmv.
