Agree, but when Democrats are pointing out the hypocrisy of the GOP, they are appealing to the Independent voters that can be reason with, not the GOP.
While I tend to agree that I know very few people who go down the ballot and pick half GOP and half Dems anymore, there's a fair number of moderate-leaning-GOP people who have been paying attention and are now moderate-leaning-DEM (I have family like this). But the moment the GOP rids itself of MAGA they could flip back, so dems need to keep the spotlight on the hypocrisy and bad behavior.
It’s so hypocritical and honestly painful to watch these baffoons hold power in the House of Representatives.
Half of them are probably getting their information through right-wing media, which probably only shows the clips of republicans shrieking about having their Twitter accounts banned….
The republicans literally don’t even know the law and they’re pressuring witnesses to unethically share information. Multiple Republican members also threatened the witnesses with arrest and indictment even though it was clear no crimes were committed.
The chairman of the committee was pressuring a former top legal counsel for Twitter to breach client confidentiality. He told him three times that he had to answer the question because he was under subpoena. Until Jamie Raskin pointed out that subpoenas don’t overrule attorney-client privilege.
