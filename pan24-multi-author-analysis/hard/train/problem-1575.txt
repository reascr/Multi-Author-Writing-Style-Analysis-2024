He really is, and it hurts my soul because he is the tennis machine that people thought Pete Sampras was. He is absolutely the best tennis player I've ever seen and I've seen all of the others back to 1990.
Well hes a record breaking tennis player. He certainly knows what he is doing on the tennis court. But you can't then say hes an expert in everything, like medical science.
He has a huge social media following, it could absolutely influence and change opinions. That in turn can make tangible changes. IE the news articles like this and the fact he doesn't speak against it probably bolsters the Russian supporters and moves Serbia that much more toward Russia and away from Western aligned countries.
It's certainly not a minority, there's an awful lot of Serbs that don't like "the west" and NATO because we stopped their little excursion in to Kosova which Russia supports.
Actually, this appears to be a vocal minority within Serbia (I dont live there so I dont know for sure) but it appears that as a whole, Serbia is having enough of Russia and pushing for more European integration over Russian.
It's interesting for sure, but I do think attitudes are starting to shift, the biggest thing that is changing is how Russia did support Serbia with Kosovo, however with their current stance and involvement in Ukraine, this make this not so certain anymore.
Yes, this is mainly what I was angling at, seems we agree, just that I think if he changed popular support in Serbia perhaps it could influence the war. If people are against the war then measures against the war can be further supported by politicians. Politicians won't oppose the war if the people don't because they only care about staying in power not what's ethically right.
