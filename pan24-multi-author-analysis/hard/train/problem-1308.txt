That’s a solid plan just for sustainability, regardless of health implications. They are also better insulators and typically don’t impart a taste on whatever. I don’t really use silicon containers though. I can appreciate the use of plastic containers for food and water for things like backpacking for weight saving, titanium light but also is super expensive.
I think not consuming liquids from plastic or eating anything that has been heated in plastic is a solid thing you can do to support your overall hormonal health. These effects add up especially considering other pollutions in the air and drinking water, diet related issues, and physical activity level issues, and hormonal health is important for your mental and physical health.
I’m personally not sure why it causes issues in terms of health impacts but if I had to make a guess, the presence of a reactive group could mean that when it’s ingested the reactive part can bond or place itself physically in your body and because it cannot break down it may continue to disrupt important body functions.
The question is what form is the chemical in when it’s for example shedded from a non stick pan? It is different from when it is initially manufactured.
