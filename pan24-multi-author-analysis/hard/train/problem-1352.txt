"Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, former executive vice-president of NSERC and now senior fellow at the Institute for Science, Society and Policy at the University of Ottawa, noted that the new security guidelines only cover federal grants and not individual academic research with Chinaâ€™s military. China offers a lot of money to Canadian researchers and universities to work with them, she said.
Yes, the Chinese pay for Canadian weapon research in bad, Canadian can get the money and the weapon. Since the Chinese only use the weapon on their own citizens.
Please refresh on your WW2 history, West gave up Czechoslovakia long before Poland. Soviets fought Finland even earlier, and the Poles right after WW1.
The Soviets started WW2 with Germany, the only reason the west did not fight them was the poles did not call the allies into the war vs Stalin.
After the war we gave up Poland to the Soviets and let them take half of Europe. To me this was a mistake, to reward one of the aggressors who started ww2. But the west were exhausted and wanted peace.
Like i wrote earlier in the convo, the west was exhausted and wanted peace. I understand this very well, but that does not make it right to condem millions to slavery under the communist dictatorship of Stalin.
