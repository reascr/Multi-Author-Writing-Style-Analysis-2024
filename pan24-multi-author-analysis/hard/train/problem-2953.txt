As for my mental well being? I'm fine. I can be use to something, and still be disappointed. Palest person in the family, but apathy and disdain isn't new. As my brother says, "Ain't nobody give a fuck about the red man." Being trans hasn't really changed that. Twice as ignored is still ignored, unless someone thinks that nobody is looking. I just don't go out much without family, and stay tf away from cops.
