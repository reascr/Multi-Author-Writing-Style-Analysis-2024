You have a religious belief that white people should be discriminated against? You'll end up in jail.
Oh, they still want to fight. But just like with Trump and the midterms, they don't want to be seen losing a fight.
Laws against gay marriae are clearly bigoted, but theres an obvious place for a law that says a 40 year old man can't marry a 12 year old.
My point was, they shouldn't be in the business of deciding who can marry, as they were historically by barring same-sex marriages. I was simply expressing support for the bill, as it codifies further the ability for all couples of legal age to be married.
The bill mandates states to recognize marriages from other states as well as codifies federal protections and benefits for couples as long as the marriage certificate is valid in the state it was issued. If Obergefell v. Hodges were to be overturned, theoretically a state can ban gay marriage but it would still have to recognize a gay marriage as valid if performed in a state recognizing said marriage. Basically, the law allows states to discriminate within their own borders and refuse to issue marriage certificates, but MUST accept marriages performed outside their borders within the US as valid.
It requires states to recognize marriage licenses issued by other states where a same-sex marriage license is legal. It’s using the same authority that enables us to drive across state lines with a single driver’s license rather than take a driving test in every state.
Note, a valid driver’s license entitles us to drive in every state without the need to get a driver’s license for every state we drive in. Marriage licenses work the same way.
