There’s a big difference between publicly stating “the Holocaust was exaggerated” and answering in a survey “I think the Holocaust deaths must have been lower”.
There's a big difference between "How many people do you think were killed during the Holocaust?" as an open ended question as opposed to "Do you think the number of holocaust deaths were exaggerated"?
One sentence of explanation about what the holocaust is doesn't magically make the results more reputable or less worthless. The questions after Q11 are still very in depth.
It doesn't matter what people answered. Even if you get an explanation of one sentence about what the Holocaust is, you then have to answer 80(!) more questions about that topic you apparently previously haven't heard about. The result will not be very useful, other than that you could conclude that this percentage is ignorant or received poor aducation. But that's not the conclusion the headlines show.
