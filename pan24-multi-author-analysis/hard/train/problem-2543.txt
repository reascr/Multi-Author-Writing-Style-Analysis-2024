Yes. Its not Hungary who has the threat of Russian invasion hanging over their heads, so Orban takes Putin's money and KGB aid and plays these games in NATO and the EU.
Yeah, kicking out Orban’s Hungary would be a very clear message that NATO won’t tolerate fascist belligerents within its ranks, and Erdogan might be a little triggered by that notion.
As a Hungarian I call for the immediate review of Hungary in Nato - I would add Eurozone but countries do have a right to refuse policies and its a more convoluted agreement, but Nato should tell them what the stick looks like.
If you’re saying the decision to admit Finland and Sweden is only a “danger” to Hungary because it will cut into the amount of money Orban will be able to get for himself and his cronies through illicit means, I’ll agree with you. 😉.
OTOH, refusing, not because this could be a legitimate threat to your country, but because you’re gleefully rubbing your hands together in anticipation of how much money/concessions you can extract would be an illegitimate reason.
But I’ll take your word that you are correct in that there’s nothing specifically preventing Hungary from denying entry for any reason they want. So I guess it could even be for an absurd reason. Maybe Orban propositioned Marin, Marin refused, and now Orban wants to get revenge.
