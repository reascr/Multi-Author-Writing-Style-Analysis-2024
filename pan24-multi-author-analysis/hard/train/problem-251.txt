The sheriff needs to be a law enforcement position that is hired by the county council, reports to the county council, and can be fired by the county council.
The sheriff is the highest law enforcement officer in their respective county because they are elected. There are recent instances of sheriffs arresting and threatening jail for federal agents harassing citizens. The importance of the sheriff is that they are elected and therefore answer only to the public and voters.
If the sheriff gets to decide on their own what is and isn't constitutional, that sheriff is above the constitution.
What a flawed belief, that law enforcement has the ability, legally or otherwise, to make judgements on what's Constitutional and what isn't.
What I pointed out elsewhere is there's a difference between refusing to enforce a law they believe to be immoral and refusing one they believe to be unconstitutional.
They have a moral obligation to protect us from immoral laws, and that distinction is important because the constitution has often been wrong in terms of morality.
Yes waiting a few days to get a gun is like just as immoral as the perfectly constitutional laws requiring slaves to be returned to their owners were.
