A protest (also called a demonstration, remonstration or remonstrance or a maree richo) is a public expression of objection, disapproval or dissent towards an idea or action, typically a political one.
Yeah I mean again, and really trying to not sound condescending here but the point of a protest isn't necessarily to achieve anything, it's about raising your voice and protesting something.
It's kind of like playing dumb and being a smug asshole towards people taking part in this protest. It won't cause Russia to immediately and magically win the war, but in a small way it actively contributes towards it by making fun of people opposing them.
It will showcase the Finnish people's desire to continue supporting Ukraine against Russia, which directly contributes to the amount of political power the Finnish government has to send Ukraine more aid and defense materiel. It will without a doubt achieve something.
