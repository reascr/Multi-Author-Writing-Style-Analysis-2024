There are numerous intentional structural reasons this just simply wouldn't work in the current USA. Aside from the objective fact that red states take more than they produce and would be in some very deep shit if they didn't have the blue states to bail them out, there's the military to consider, and the vast web of federal programs that make our daily lives possible. If red states split off, they would immediately turn into a poor third world country and lose 20 years of life expectancy.
If this looked like it was going to happen anyway despite that due to some collective insanity, I would immediately list my house for sale and get the hell out of here. (Texas).
Texas would likely go out on their own. They don't like welfare programs and social safety nets. I can't imagine that they would increase their support to poorer states like Mississippi or Alabama. Florida would probably do the same. Most of Florida will be under water soon anyway. Georgia might stay in the US along with Arizona and possibly North Carolina. The rich red states wouldn't want to burden themselves with whatever is left. They will build a wall to keep it Mississippians.
It certainly isn't a blue state. The Republican party controls both houses of the state legislature, governor, secretary of state, and attorney general. I hope Georgia continues the good fight and turns blue one day. You are not quite there yet.
The big producers like Alaska, Texas, and the states around the Gulf of Mexico are not land locked. North Dakota is also a top 5 producer that borders Canada so they wouldn't have to deal with the US. There might be some that are, but they likely border other red states with access to the ocean or a neighboring country.
