I agree entirely that policy changes are the key to successful improvements. However, I don't see how that gives a pass to people for electing officials who implement bad policy that scales emissions PER CAPITA because.. well, there are not as many of us as those guys over there who have a less dirty set of policies. I guess it's fine for small countries to just burn oil for fun because well they're small so their emissions are not as high in absolute terms? Do you applaud the UAE for their much better environmental record than the US? I don't - because their emissions are stupidly high for such a tiny country. Having a small population doesn't suddenly make it OK.
As for your incredulity at trebling the population and keeping emissions the same... This was your suggestion not mine. I simply pointed out that those people came from somewhere, so the places they came from will have decreased emissions, thus an overall gain.
Also, if you treble the poulation of the US and keep emissions the same, you will have decreased worldwide emissions - because those people came from somewhere.
If per capita was in any way a good measure, we could just triple the US's population, keep the same emission, and everything would be fine, right? The environment would be better off?
More people means decreased emissions? Do you think that pregnant women absorb CO2 from the atmosphere or something?
