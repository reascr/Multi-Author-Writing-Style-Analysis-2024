Abandoning Ukraine does not mean the war ends. Russia is unable to control Ukraine. The Ukrainians have shown they will not surrender to Russian imperialism, so if we abandon Ukraine, it just means that the conflict will drag on into a guerrilla war. The only way the war ends is if Putin comes to his senses or if the Ukrainians win so decisively that Putin can't fight on anymore. So the best thing we can do to end the war is to hasten Ukrainian victory.
I'm sure Russia and everyone else is so concerned about saving Ukraine. Bless their little hearts. The only way to save it at this point is to finish this war that someone else started.
Besides, Ukraine has already lasted far longer than it should have. Why give up anything now, when they're winning more than Russia and anyone else thought at the start of this? Keep going, make it costly for Russia for as long as it takes. It's what's best for Ukraine, it's what's best for the U.S., and we can see right through this anonymous article's propaganda, Putin. I mean whoever, you are.
