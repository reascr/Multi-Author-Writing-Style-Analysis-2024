Wtf are you talking about how’s your Biochemistry, genetics, Organic Chem? Or less of a science guy, how about a bit of Calculus? How many languages do you have familiarity with? Can you give me the context of a well known piece of literature within its cultural milieu? No, you are a parrot, squawking crap you heard on TV. There’s a real world out there whether or not you want to pretend it doesn’t in your Cable TV world. Education matters.
“Education.” You mean indoctrination? I mean, I don’t know how anyone can support socialism, think farting cows are destroying the environment, deny binary gender, and deny the humanity of the unborn , buy into CRT and every new woke label, and actively work to cancel “wronhink” and still claim the mantle of “educated.” Degreed, yes. But not educated.
DeSantis is absolutely fantastic and checks all the boxes: conservative, traditional, eloquent, disciplined, whip-smart.
IrishJoe, so will Democrats. We are that polarized. If Republicans ran a war hero or Ivy League grad and Democrats ran Rosie O’Donnell or one of the Kardashians, you can still bet on a close election whose result would be uncertain.
I would likely vote for a really deficient candidate with all sorts of liabilities who was running as a Democrat in order to prevent Republicans from having the seat. I think lots of people here would as well.
