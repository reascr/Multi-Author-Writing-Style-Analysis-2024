Where the big debate with Russia is what are their minimum levels. 120 if true is incredibly low. Like thats borderline inadequate for a war with just Estonia. What has kept real analysts surprised is just how low Russia is willing to push its stocks.
As an example the US still has about 20,000 javelins but are very reluctant to send more as they feel 20,000 is minimum just in case level.
Also like 90% of the attacks in the last 30 days have been with Iranian "drones." Which are new to the conflict.
Ya the same people who call a BTR a tank. If you listen to people who know the difference between a AK47 and a T90 the speculation is how many missile do they have left and how many do they feel they need to keep in reserve.
Older, less-effective stuff they have in storage, import weapons (which seem to be mostly Iranian and maybe North Korean), and whatever they're able to accomplish with air strikes and lesser artillery.
Air strikes put their (also expensive and hard to replace) planes at risk, and artillery usually needs to be closer (so also at risk, but it's less expensive if/when it's destroyed or captured) and tends to be less accurate.
