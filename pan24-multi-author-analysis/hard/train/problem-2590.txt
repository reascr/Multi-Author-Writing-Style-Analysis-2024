So, you're ok with countries taking their neighbors by force? By letting Russia keep even one meter of Ukrainian territory, you signal to putin and every other dictator in the world that conquering your neighbors is back on the table, like it's the middle ages again. It will encourage China to take Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Either we stop Russia now, or they take Ukraine fully over the next decade, and kill millions of ukranians, because people like you whine about helping other countries defend their homeland.
Where we are now is that the far right MAGA element of the Republican party are openly pro-Russia and they want to cut military aid to Ukraine to help Russia to win the war. That's all this is. Please don't take them at their word, because they've shown time and again that they don't deserve it.
However, Republicans werent questioning US military spend during the 8 years of Bush, or 4 years of Trump. Trump promised to pull out of foreign wars and put America First. Yet military spending still went up and Republicans cheered it.
Like almost everything the right does, it's in bad faith, so it shouldn't be engaged with or taken seriously.
