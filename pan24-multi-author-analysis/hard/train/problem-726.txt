Right? Kevin McCarthy is going to go insane trying to corrall whiny over-priviliged asshats like Gaetz and Greene and Gosar. I wish him the best worst.
I generally don't go in for this kind of thing, but I think Democrats should totally give McCarthy a run for his money and put it through multiple votes just to fuck with him.
Yeah nominate one of the few centrist Republicans, get a few people to your side and badabing you advert the worst, show bipartisanship and piss off the rancid right.
Why are we all acting like the Dems need to find a Republican who they can vote for? Moderate Republicans (if they even exist) should look for a moderate Democrat, say "hey, you have our 6-7 votes" and all the Dems get behind them.
Republicans act nastier than democrats so maybe it looks harsher or that there's more internal strife, but there's not. This is just how assholes determine who comes out on top. And the assholes who lose will lick their boot after. Don't look for schadenfreude here, you're only gonna play yourself in the long term.
Uh no, this is normal political horse-trading and negotiating. When the outcome is determined, they'll rally behind whoever wins and the chapter will be over.
Same thing with this insane idea that Trump and Desantis will destroy the part fighting each other, as if nobody here has ever heard of a primary election before.
"Republicans are fighting, oh so they are eating themselves alive and this means they will be distracted fighting each other!".
