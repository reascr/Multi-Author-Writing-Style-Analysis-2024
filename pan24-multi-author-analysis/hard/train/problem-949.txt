"Ask a Soviet engineer to design a pair of shoes and heâ€™ll come up with something that looks like the boxes that the shoes came in; ask him to make something that will massacre Germans, and he turns into Thomas Fucking Edison.".
Yah, that is not going to happen. These countries are using Russian weapons largely because of their history with the US.
The US has already given what few operational Russian weapon systems it had to Ukraine. Why is the US doing this trade? Because Ukraine predominately uses Russian weapons and it makes sense from a training and logistics stand point to continue to supply them when able.
1) Because Russian made weapons are easier for Ukraine to operate and maintain since these are the same weapons they use, are trained on and have the supply and logistics capability already in place for.
2) To help divest countries from relying on Russia for military hardware, further isolating Russia from the global economy.
Because it's a better option than a self destructing Russia from a capabilities, logistics, and training standpoint. Like if Brazil had purchased modern 2s6s, how are they going to keep them operational? Develop the entire infrastructure in house to maintain them? Way too costly. Get paid to give them to Ukraine to fight with/use as part donor vehicles and use that payment to acquire American weapons? Way cheaper and they're more effective.
