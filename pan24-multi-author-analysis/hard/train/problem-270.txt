My hope is that due to Senate control already being in Dem hands, Republican who didn’t vote for him in the general election won’t bother coming out to vote for him in the runoff.
Maybe, but Dems have other incentives that Republicans don’t. For example, Dems might be motivated to come out and vote for Warnock because they simply don’t want a moron representing them in the Senate. But, yes, of course, every Dem in Georgia shouldn’t take victory for granted and get to the polls.
Sort of, but Georgia is still a pretty red state, despite democrats having some success in recent years(Warnock and Biden won the state). The way I see it Republicans vote for Republicans, democrats vote for Democrats no matter what, exceptions are rare. The independents decide the election, Trump and Walker are so toxic that the independents in Georgia overwhelming vote Democrat.
Yeah, she might win against another Democrat in a general election, Republicans do stick together. But there is no way in hell she'd win a GOP primary.
She is dead-set against getting re-elected, isn't she? If she flips to R, there is no way she wins. There is no way in hell that Republicans are going to vote for an openly bisexual woman that used to be a filthy Democrat.
Also, tell me there's no bisexuals in the Republican Party. Probably harder to find environmentalists. However the bottom line is they will welcome anybody that will "play ball" with them and look the other way.
You underestimate the pervasiveness and brainwashing of the Republican Propaganda Network...they have Fox, OAN, NewsMax, RSBN as well as all the Facebook profiles from Cambridge Analytica, not to mention the non-profit, untaxed, but political churches and networks, like TBN.
