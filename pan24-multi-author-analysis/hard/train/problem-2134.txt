... And then he goes and has no issues in supporting Israel due to its race, religion and political views.
Basically, it comes down to the Israel-Palestine issue, and all the problems therein. Some Zionists readily move to equate criticizing Israel as being antisemitic, but that's a false equivalency.
Trump is antisemtic and has implied Jews aren't Americans and claimed to a group of American Jews that "Israel is your country".
EDIT: The reason antisemites bring up Israel in every thread about American Jews is because they can't stand the narrative that some Jews are victims.
Antisemites can't resist bringing up iSrAeL in threads about American Jews, despite American Jews having no say in Israeli politics. They do it because they can't stand Jews being viewed as victims and want to shift the narrative to Jews as aggressors and therefore deserving of hate.
They can be, but usually when I see someone winning whining about being called anti-semitic for "criticizing Israel" it's because they have in fact been being grossly anti-semitic. The "you can't critize Israel without being called anti-semitic!" line is the typical defense of left wing Anti-semites.
This is why you get accused of antisemitism. This is not an article about Israel, why should we be talking about it in this thread?
That's true, but we also shouldn't let this get in the way of legitimate discourse about Israel's policies.
