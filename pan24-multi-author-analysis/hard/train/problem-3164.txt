Oh yeah, I'm just wondering how someone can say they're still hoping enough people come around. A clear majority isn't enough because we don't have a democracy, so how many is enough?
Well they voted for them, so if most Americans felt this way they wouldn't be in office. I can't believe MTG and people like her were voted back into office.
With all the elected officials just ignoring the will of the people, my vote may mean little to nothing anyway.
They don't think that being an elected official means you should represent your constituents. They believe they are elected into a position of power, to tell people what to do, and make laws banning the things they think people shouldn't be doing. So if they won the election, that means more people wanted their ideas to be enacted and put into law. If they lost, then they don't believe it.
Democrats believe that they are voted in to actually represent the people that voted them in, which -- yes, sadly -- does require them to speak up for the minority (see: conservatives) sometimes, as they are still people and still fall under the purview of "should have representation". They don't boss people around, they aren't browbeating the minority into "shutting up and accepting the loss", they aren't one to turn around and say "here's the new laws that you have to follow, so deal with it or else the cops will be all over you".
One side thinks they're elected to be boss people around, the other side thinks they're elected to lead.
