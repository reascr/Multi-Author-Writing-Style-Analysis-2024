You're asking WAY too much with the current voter population. If younger people start voting as regularly as the older people, THEN you will start to see monumental changes and the likely resultant pushback from the regressive crowd.
Everybody wants fast and large change but it's not going to happen as long as the Republicans are in control of even one branch of government.
We actually are getting fast large change but for the worst with republican controlled supreme court. The fact we have to spend two seconds listening to people like Mitch McConnell, MTG, Lauren Boebert, Josh Hawley, or anyone else of that caliber... It's a huge red flag.
Increased military spending, no legalization, no student loan forgiveness are pretty much the reasons I feel we deserve much more than a moderate-practically republican-but at least not a traitor (yet) Biden.
Edit: For those of you making bold assumptions I don't know how gubment works, here's me saying you don't know who you're talking about when you defend Biden because Congress... Here ya go nerds:
