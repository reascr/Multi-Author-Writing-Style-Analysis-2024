My dad had the mayor resign due to corruption in allowing his buddies illegal permitting to basically run a feed lot on two acres next to us.
I don't think we should be taking the word of law enforcement as some perpetual good as if "known to law enforcement" actually MEANS anything. Plenty of people are subjected to them having done no wrong.
From that day on I was personally "known to law enforcement" as a sixteen year-old who hadn't broken any laws and pulled over regularly as a "check-in" because they were pissed their corrupt buddy had to face consequences for his actions.
Yeah, there's a lot of attention being paid to the sheriff's office's attitude towards red flags, but you aren't going to keep guns out of people's hand for 2 years or more if the DA won't prosecute them for the related offense. Sure, the topics are related.
Yeah, that is what I meant. It would extraordinary for an order barring his access to firearms to have been extended this long if a trial were not moving forward.
