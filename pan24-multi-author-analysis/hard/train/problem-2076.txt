During the initial years of the cold war India chose to be neutral between the us and ussr as they believed they were too poor to participate (India was importing food at that time).
The us was still mostly neutral between India and Pakistan until Richard Nixon.He established a very close relationship with Pakistan, aiding it militarily and economically. He considered Pakistan as a very important ally to counter Soviet influence in the Indian subcontinent and establish ties with China, with whom Pakistan was very close.
Russia is increasingly wary of Chinese influence in the region and uses India to counter that influence while maintaining a good trade relationship with both.
If there is conflict with China, Russia will be on the other side and this is the fundamental problem for India, not relations with the US.
Be careful, for sure ... but India's real concern at this moment is Russia, not the US. Russia has "unlimited alliance" with China and China is an adversary. India is dependent on Russia and Russia is dependent on China. China is allying with Pakistan.
Pakistan on the other hand wanted to also ally with both the USSR and the US. But India has already established a much closer relationship with the USSR by then and they refused to ally with Pakistan too much. Moreover india had just bought supersonic jets from USSR. So pakistan had no choice but to ally with the US and buy their own jets. The US seeing india slip more and more with the USSR strenhened their relationship with Pakistan as they were natural enemies with india.
