Well, yeah, obviously we are racist, because we have racist policies like affirmative action in place. But I think you can take solace in the fact that we are making progress… we are looking to end racist policies like affirmative action. So there is still hope.
I don’t know if that’s true. I would think it’s the opposite. Maybe the number of people getting into college increases, but once you create a subset of a minority that is better off than their peers, then they will be taking up the slots that AA intends for their more disadvantaged counterparts.
Under the current system, a wealthy black student benefits from AA while a poor Asian student gets a low personal score and has lower chance of getting in.
Do you think it's morally justified that some wealthy black kid who attended private schools yet still couldn't crack a 1400 on the SAT should receive preference over a higher IQ Asian kid who attended public school and was on the verge of homelessness but scored a 1600?
Someone who is born in a wealthy household, who attended private schools and had the best tutors and still scoring under the 95th percentile on the SAT and worse than a poor Asian kid shouldn't receive any kind of preference.
What if the other students simply can't afford to financially compete with the affluent asian families? It's much more complicated than "stepping up their game.".
