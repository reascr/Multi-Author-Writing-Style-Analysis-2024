Those countries basically fall into two groups: autocratic governments who love Putin because Russia's Wagner group helps them with unpleasant acts like killing dissidents, and various South American countries who rightly resent US imperialism in the 20th century and thus don't care about Russia's imperialism.
And then there's India, which is basically forced to play nice with Russia out of fear that they will cut India off from maintenance and spare parts for their mostly-Russian military.
The Indian relationship with Russia is likely on borrowed time at this point anyway, despite a long history of Russian weapons exports to India, and Russian support for India in general. As Russia becomes weaker and more isolated as a result of the war in Ukraine, Russia is also becoming increasingly reliant on China to the point where it may basically become a Chinese satellite state. Russia-Chinese ties are a big red flag for India, who sees China as their primary geopolitical rival. India could not accept being reliant on a Chinese ally for weapons that they may need to use against China.
The diminishing reputation of Russia's weapons due to their poor showing on the battlefield, and Russia's reduced ability to provide continuing support for their weapons only compounds the problem.
