if you think somehow the ignorant voters are going to suddenly replace ousted candidates with better options, then you are sorely mistaken, or you have such a low opinion of current candidates that you think "everything must be better".
It's pretty hard to believe that people are consciously voting for Johnson and a Democratic governor, AG, and SoS...so, if you ask me, I feel like the majority of people here are just morons voting for the incumbents.
agree with the other comment - all of these limits are just excuses for voters voting shitty people into office.
Gerrymandering affects statewide elections as well, because if the majority of your votes feels meaningless because of it, why turn out at all?
Hopefully they start to gerrymander the state so they can consolidate power like the GOP has done in Texas, NC, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Florida etc etc etc No more playing nice.
I can tell you, living in a state with a supermajority of Democrats in the state legislature, that you might need to badger them to get that progress. Keep those phones ringing.
