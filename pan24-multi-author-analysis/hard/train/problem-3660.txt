Everybody is saying they want to cut SS to address the debt limit. Isnâ€™t SS supposed to be self sufficient? I know I pay a lot of SS taxes. How do SS benefits add to the debt?
Social Security is a payroll tax on wages. 6.2% from our employers, which is part of our compensation, and 6.2% from us, so we don't end up in the streets when we're 80 years old.
Take that line item on my check stub that says "UnitedHealthcare", change it to say "Medicare for All", and lob off 10-15%. I know we can't knock off all of the profits and costs currently going to the industry, but that chunk taken away will be nice. Boom, Medicare for everyone and it's sustainable.
And yup, changing that label from "UnitedHealthCare" to "Medicare for All" would change the line item from being the highest chunk taken out of our paychecks to the highest tax increase in history. Nothing but a fuggin' reclass. And it would be a great thing!
Oh great. I'm so happy to be alive during this time where I don't have massive amounts of fuck you money to combat all this bullshit. Instead, I go to work and come home all while watching my future decay before my eyes because these greedy fucks want more money.
