Even before Musk bought it, I'd get random-ass right-wing pundits and heavily slanted conservative news sites with clickbait headlines. It got exponentially worse after Musk bought it, complete with shit like Kyle Rittenhouse whining and Donald Trump Jr.'s misspelled rants against Joe Biden.
This morning I was looking for a compilation of funny scenes from an anime (a goofy comedy about a woman who has a dragon for a maid) and about every eighth one was some smug right-winger ranting about...whatever. Note, this is even after I've blocked channels and clicked "Not interested in this type of content " constantly.
I'm constantly getting fed stupid Joe Rogan clips on YouTube and I keep blocking or saying I'm not interested.
My favorite thing is YouTube repeatedly ignoring my “don’t show me any more from this channel” with the Joe Rogan Experience. I literally can’t escape them on YouTube.
YouTube? Music videos, anime and video game reviews, sci-fi & fantasy movie trailers, cooking and household DIY repair stuff....but then Joe Rogan, Benny Shapiro, and some random-ass Fox News clips constantly show up.
