For real. Every conservative I know that lives in a shitty town run into the ground by conservative policies are all certain the Libs and Hillary Clinton are to blame. Every time the power goes out from moderate rain storm, or the roads are crumbling, or that there's no jobs. Zero critical thinking skills to realize that it's the people in charge of their immediate area (Republicans) that are making their lives worse.
As it's been for at least the last several decades, which has only gotten worse in the last 10-15, Republicans will throw literally anything at the wall of outrage and see what sticks. Obviously the outrage over Obama's tan suit was never the color of his suit but rather the (color of the) man wearing it. If instead of police brutality and racial injustice, Kaepernick had been kneeling to oppose abortions or gun control, he'd have been their hero. And of course, one can rightly say that if he had been opposing abortion, Democrats wouldn't have supported him -- but they also wouldn't have taken issue with the kneeling!
Because (as I'm sure you are already aware, but I add for the sake of others), kneeling was never the issue.
