As Republicans hold our economy hostage with the debt ceiling, MAGA Republicans will demand cuts to Social Security and Medicare, the programs they like to call “entitlements” that Americans have paid into for decades.
Republicans are playing chicken with our economy and it’s a dangerous game. Remember that Steve Bannon was very clear in 2017 when he said their goal is deconstruction of the administrative state. These Republicans want to destroy the federal government and any safety nets it provides to the American people. Make no mistake. This is the GOP’s goal.
Stuff like this is where you see the GOP's real priorities. Their plan is to abolish income tax and the IRS and replace it with a consumption tax. The outcome of that would be effectively a massive increase in tax on the poorest people who spend their entire income every month, and a massive break for the wealthy who actually spend a very small percentage of what they make. So a multi-millionaire would probably end up not paying a great deal more in taxes than someone working at McDonald's. They would of course still pay more, but the actual percentage of their income going towards that would be laughably trivial, and they wouldn't have to worry about capital gains, estate tax, or any other taxes.
