Hungary is as much afraid of Russia as all the other neighboring countries. They just also really like to piss of the rest of the EU.
It's more playing no sides than both sides, while still demanding protection from one side against the other.
What is a defensive pact worth when you aren't willing to defend yourself? Is an attack on Poland worth less than an attack on the USA, France or Germany would be just because it is in closer proximity to a conflict zone? If you draw a line which you don't enforce there is no line.
So they could be trying to find that line/balance, testing the limits off what they can get away with.
They are testing their own limits and how far they can go. This is a textbook example of testing if someone is serious about red lines or not. If NATO doesnâ€™t react in a proper way, nobody will take it seriously anymore.
They would want to test NATO with something relatively meaningless first to cause internal turmoil within NATO.
And in such case they shouldn't aim anywhere closer than 5 miles to Polish border as then it would be matter of time when it hits Poland.
