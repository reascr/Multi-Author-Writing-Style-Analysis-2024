She used antisemitic tropes/conspiracy theories when criticizing Israel. It wasnt a coincidence. Antisemitic tropes are still antisemitic whether you put Israel or Jews as the subject.
So being antisemitic is still not the same as having anti-Muslim bias, though both are discriminatory of course.
Like the poster said above me, I’d go call it “anti-Muslim bias.” There should be a distinction between being against the religion itself and being against the people who just happen to follow it. This is coming from someone who was born into the faith and has left.
Edit: Also, Jewish is an ethnicity; you can’t just not be Jewish anymore in that aspect. For example, the majority of Israelis are actually secular but still identity as Jewish. (Because they are).
True that. Having other religions (barely) in the picture might be helpful to shore up the separation of church and state though.
What’s the valid critique of her then? I only saw a critique of her religion there. Same as kicking somebody out because they’re Jewish and, say, questioned our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Although the Republicans haven’t invited Mohammed bin Salman to address the Senate yet.
