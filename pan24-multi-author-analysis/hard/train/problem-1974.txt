I agree. They need to prove on paper they feed and shelter the poor to get some sort of deduction. If they are promoting violence or otherwise failing to teach turning the other cheek that should disqualify them from being a Christian church. They would be classified as a fundamentalist terror group.
Focus on the Family is a terrorist organization. They terrorized me as a queer kid. The fact that they still persist is a stain on the nation along with all the other hate groups. Iâ€™m glad you survived their attempts to brainwash and destroy you. <3.
Yep. Growing up, I remember there being a distinct separation between Denver, Castle Rock, and the Springs. Last time I was out there, it was one, unbroken suburb between all of it. It was shocking.
As a gay man who grew up in Colorado, Focus on the Family has been an absolute cancer on that state for decades. They are beyond hateful. I wrote a letter to the editor to the Denver paper back in 2003 or so in support of marriage equality. I started receiving harassing voicemails from a condescending, patrician-sounding man from Focus on the Family, asking that I "debate" with him about how "incorrect" my position was. These people are fucking evil.
