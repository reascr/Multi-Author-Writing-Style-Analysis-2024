All joking aside, I got Pfizer x2. Then Pfizer boosted. Then actual Covid in July. Then the new booster October.
My elderly parents got Moderna x3. They wanted to travel so I had them get Pfizer in February before a trip. Then got them to new booster. So 5 shots. They’ve been good so far!
But I also accept that at this point, people can make their decisions and if you end up very sick, well don’t say I didn’t warn you.
But the problem with a pandemic is other people’s decisions still affect me. So I would prefer if everyone was Vax’ed and boosted because while it’s not a sterilizing vaccine, it does reduce the spreading of covid and any reduction is helpful to everyone.
In my case I have pretty much all the vaccines and the covid one twice so I wouldn't categories myself as anti vax just because I don't believe that this particular one is necessary to be taken in its current form in perpetuity. That being said, I'm open to taking one that provides a longer term protection.
The vaccine is also not without risk. If the vaccine protection didn't wane so quickly and actually could arrest the spread then I would support your point of view but it does not. How many shots is enough for you, 5, 50, 500?
