If people say these countries support Ukrainian war then every Windows or Apple user for past 20 years supported US wars in Middle East. You support the "genocide" in China by having most things in your house made in China. Millions of people who tuned in or turned up to Qutar football supports the treatment of their workers.
Please tell us beT course of action against these evil countries that want to ease their already difficult situations.
Besides when you know something is NEEDED then you would be stupid to sell it dirt cheap. Besides if Russia offers the best price then you also save a bit on transport since ME is not right next to Japan like Russia is.
Oil price in Japan is fine, there are also a lot of affordable public transports such as bus, trains & high-speed trains (which often corporations cover the cost too).
All of the foreign parties that have invested in the project can totally afford that loss as not only they are massive (Mitsubishi is just that big), they were already aware years before about the potential risk of a sudden loss of their shares so they are prepared for it.
