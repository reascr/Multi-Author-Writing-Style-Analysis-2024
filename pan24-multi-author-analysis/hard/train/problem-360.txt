However, this is a real problem that many developed nations are facing and it’s only going to get to worse. I know we like to shit on the government and “rich people” as if they’re doing this out of some sadistic intention. But that narrative is patently false. They’re doing it because they have very limited options and ideas on how to tackle a pretty insidious and worsening societal consequence of the excellence of modern healthcare.
No. The world is facing a fundamental issue symptomatic of people living longer. Retired people impose huge pressures on society as their demographic grows from living longer while becoming economically inactive for longer. Most of this strain is imposed upon working age people. And the effects are so macroeconomic and far reaching that there are too many to condense into a single comment.
The bottom line is that when you retire, you start to cost society more than you contribute. And many countries now have ageing populations. And again, that’s not to speak ill of anyone who is retired or insist that increasing the retirement age is a good thing or the best course. It’s just a difficult situation. This is also why immigrants are very good for a country, they buff the working age population, and help alleviate these stresses.
If you don't want massive immigration (which I understand the French don't), this is the only other way to have a working age population. Life expectancy has gone up 20-30 years and the retirement age has barely budged.
Are they aware they are ALREADY having highest life expectancy and lowest retirement age? Even with 64 they are well off.
