This is inaccurate. It’s neither the official stance of Finland and directly contradicts what the Finnish PM said just earlier today in a press release. It also doesnt reflect the direction of the public conversation on the topic in Finland that has been ongoing over the last few weeks. (Link to news article about Finnish PM’s comments on the subject:
Meanwhile, Finlands’ NATO ascencion is unlikely to happen before this summers' NATO summit, after Turkey’s has held elections.
If Finland magically gets into NATO but Sweden doesn't, it effectively turns into an island surrounded by NATO. That definitely improves their security situation but it allows them to be "freeloaders" hoping that others in their way protect them from the Russians so it's better to tie them into the joint alliance.
I do understand that, seeing the perceived vs actual capabilities of Russia does get a bit smile on most people's faces but that sort of attitude can easily lead to complacency and complacency is dangerous. Best we all stay aware of the horrors in Ukraine and Russia's willingness to use force to pursue their geopolitical goals.
I was joking about the fact that Russia makes threats 24/7 and that they never live up to said threats. I guess joking about it was a mistake on my part.
Sorry, but that is an immature remark. Hungary would be a weaker ally for Western countries than Turkey. To claim otherwise is ridiculous. NATO is a serious organisation that provides mutual defence in the face of national threats. I understand that Turkey appears to be a dictatorship-ruled evil country, but NATO existed long before Erdogan, and Turkey had been a member for a long time before other countries joined. Erdogan will leave tomorrow, and Turkey will return to normalcy. No major NATO member country will even consider risking the possibility of Turkey leaving the organisation because Turkey holds such an important strategic position for every other European nation.
