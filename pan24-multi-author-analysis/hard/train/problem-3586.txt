Trump won't change nor will he fade into the sunset. He'll continue down this path and end up being the Republican presidential candidate in two years, and break the party in half in either failing to win the primaries, or even in having won them.
They produced what, less than half of the gains expected in a midterm when the incumbent party's president has a less-than-50% approval rating? And the worst inflation since the 80s?

Fascism as a government is a stupid concept anyway. Especially for a large group of people to support. You might win short term, but eventually someone you dont fully agree with will come to power and you will have no choice to get them out of power without revolution, and you wont have any power to change laws or policies that no longer align with the dictator in power.
