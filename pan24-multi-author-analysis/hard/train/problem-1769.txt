As a white guy who has lived in Az and Austin (supposedly liberal) Tx, moving to NM also felt safer and more welcoming to me too.
As a Hispanic that was raised in TX, moving to NM felt safer and welcoming to me. I can't think of any good research based reason for the differences in nearby states but just an anecdote on my end. Most of my friends who live here left TX as well due to those feelings. I am curious how it all started though.
I grew up in El Paso, so it's majority Hispanic, so, unfortunately, it was my own who displayed traditional values (machismo) and plenty of conservative types. My family is pretty conservative themselves and all former military, catholic background as well, so they have this "fuck you, I got mine" attitude towards immigrants, etc. Racism runs rampant within Hispanic communities, it's beyond gross and uncomfortable.
Oh, I'm not trying to paint the whole city as being that way. I lived there since '99 and moved here in 2017 officially. I saw enough of certain traditional ideologies that it just wasn't for me. I was giving an anecdotal view of why I left to the original comment is all. I'm sure the new generation is changing but I just didn't like what I experienced and saw while there that it inspired me to leave.
