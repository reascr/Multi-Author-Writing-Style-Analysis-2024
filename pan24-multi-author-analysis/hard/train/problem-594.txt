Trump’s plan would amount to Ukraine surrendering to Russia and giving into all of Putin’s insane demands. It will not end the war in Ukraine. It would merely delay it for a few years so Russia can rearm and come back to take the rest of the country.
Just because ukraine that is still under so much of russia's past, doesn't mean they don't want to change.
Fuck off, do you understand what living under russia is like? Corruption etc but ukraine was fighting it and wanted out of russia, just like what poland did.
Russia is indeed very corrupt but so is Ukraine. Ukrainian politicians even bought mansions and spent fortunes on personal luxuries after American aid money was sent to them.
Almost no war is black and white, and history is written by the victors, and the media portrays one side as pure good and the other as pure evil wether they are right or wrong. I’m merely trying to open peoples minds to thought.
Remember the media doesn’t always tell the truth. Putin isn’t a good guy but neither is Zelensky, however public opinion of Zelensky is incredibly high because of the media. Ukraine is one of the most corrupt nations in the world before the war.
And going by your logic, how corrupt is russia? Much more than ukraine and they're not changing and haven't even tried to change.
