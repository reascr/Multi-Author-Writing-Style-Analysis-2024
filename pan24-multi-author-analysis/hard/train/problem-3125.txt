Senate is almost the hardest to pass-by, so this is good news. I do think our parliament will approve it. Worse that can happen afterward is a referendum by the people to counter it, but it would arrive too late to stop Switzerland from supplying ammunitions to Germany and therefore, Ukraine.
__Germany is not angry over Bern’s refusal to allow Berlin to re-export Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine, says the German ambassador to Switzerland.__.
"We are only talking about re-exports of ammunition produced in Switzerland and bought by Germany 20 years ago, for anti-aircraft and therefore defensive systems,” ambassador Flügger told the Swiss newspapers. "Nobody was asking Switzerland to deliver arms to Ukraine.".
Switzerland has previously rejected appeals from Germany to allow it to re-export Swiss-made ammunition to Ukraine, saying such a move would violate its neutrality. On January 11 Spain also said Switzerland was refusing to allow it to re-export war materiel to Ukraine. But pressure has been rising for Bern to review its policies, including at the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF) it recently hosted in Davos.
