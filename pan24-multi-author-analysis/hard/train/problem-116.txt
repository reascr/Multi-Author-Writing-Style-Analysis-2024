There is nothing that Russia exports that Canada does not produce for itself, except certain weapons that Canada does not make and buys from America and Europe.
And the American right wants to justify annexing Canada by force if necessary, and wants to help Russia dominate its region.
Also NATO would be bringing the war to Moscow's doorstep so there is no scenario where Russia could succeed in attacking Canada.
We have the capacity to ramp up our military exponentially we also have access to the world's most advanced weapons and would be supplied by all of our allies, Russia would be eaten alive if they even tried to attack us even if we only got material support.
If we were facing full scale invasion recruitment is quickly replaced with conscription, we would react just like Ukraine, full mobilisation and the economy would be turned into a war economy with all resources directed to the war.
The mass mobilisation of the population would be immediate, and the fact Russia would have to transport millions of troops thousands of KM just to attack any meaningful target they would be easy prey for our airforce while the country builds defences and trains troops.
So Russia would have to somehow land a force of what 10 million soldiers to have even a hope of capturing and holding anything, then they would have to somehow march over thousands of kilometers of tundra before they even came across a settlement of more than 2-300 people.
