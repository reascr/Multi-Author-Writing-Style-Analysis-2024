I'm curious if this was Putin's plan all along. Use Wagner to hire convicts and send them to the front as cannon fodder to wear down Ukrainian troops and supplies while Russia attempts to train thousands of new conscripts.
Could also be as Prigozin says. Wagner and it's convicts having more success than the Russian military, against elitist ideals etc.
"A certain number of pro-war functionaries decided that if they recruited convicts, they would be able to become famous as the Wagner Group.".
Yevgeny Prigozhin, owner of Wagner Group, named three main reasons why he was completely ousted from recruiting convicts in Russian colonies. One of the reasons is the opposition of the military leadership.
Details: This information was sent by Prigozhin to a Sverdlovsk [a Russian-occupied city in Luhansk Oblast â€“ ed.] deputy as a response to his request to assist in the recruitment of women from the colonies. The deputy posted a screenshot of the businessman's answer, although there is neither a signature nor a mention of Prigozhin or Wagner Group.
