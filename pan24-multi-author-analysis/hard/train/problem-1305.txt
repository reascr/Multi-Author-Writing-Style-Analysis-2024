Well yeah, in the sense that a guy name Laffer came up with the curve and told everybody about it. I guess that makes it real, in the same way that flat earth theory is "real.".
That's the point. There little evidence we were ever on the right side on the Laffer curve, let alone right now. Also no one really knows what that theoretical curve would actually look like when applied to something as complex as a modern tax code. It's not something you can really use to drive policy.
I think he is saying that A Laffer curve exists because the relationship between tax rates and revenue isn't purely linear and high tax rates can create economic inefficiency and push economic activity to the black market.
the Laffer curve exists in the sense that it is "a concept" in economics; it's still taught in 101/102 as a way of thinking about the relationship between taxes and government revenue.
I'm sure the Laffer curve will prove as useful for measuring negative knowledge as it was for predicting increased revenue based on tax cuts. Possibly even more so.
Is it? Or is it that the Dems do do some shit, but the GOP takes the cake. For example, when it comes to sex crimes, the GOPs crimes heavily outweigh the Dems, yet the Rs blame the Dems. When it comes to spend, the GOP has consisentley increased the debt but blame the Dems. Wars as well, taking away freedoms, etc etc.
The Dems aren't great, but the gop doesn't govern, they just blame and deflect and try to stir up little bullshit "wars on....(Christmas, stoves, etc).
I'm talking about anyone who falsified their resume. I know of bidens gaffe, but trump repeatedly claimed to be an expert in everything, but his only expertise was fraud. At least Biden is an expert in government, he has the years in it - for better or worse.
