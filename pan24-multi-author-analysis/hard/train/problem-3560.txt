“Criminologists and other researchers found that the ban had little to no effect on firearm deaths or the lethality of gun crimes. Studies have found that the overwhelming majority of gun crimes are committed with weapons which are not covered by the AWB, and that assault weapons are less likely to be used in homicides than other weapons. There is tentative evidence that the frequency of mass shootings may have slightly decreased while the ban was in effect, but research is inconclusive, with independent researchers finding conflicting results.”.

But at the same time, you cannot deny the statistics that countries with more gun regulation tend to have much less decreased rates of mass shootings relative to the US. This includes Switzerland. They have tough background checks and even concealed carry permits are scarcely given.
