There will be a myriad of lawsuits, lost SOPs, lost sponsors, eroded public trust, projects in limbo, and god knows what other compounding issues as they present themselves in the future.
The fact you would immediately make such an assumption regarding gutting a giant corporation shows how ignorant you are on the matter. Corporations move at a snail’s pace, and the impact of any decisions are also delayed in nature.
Why does everyone think companies move at a snail's pace? Second guy answering that. Would love to have that work experience, that's guaranteed. New projects have to be launched in no more than one month and sooner the better.
For example, there was a couple of users replying to me saying that Twitter usage has been down since Elon takeover, which is factually false and confirmed by basically every source you can check.
They restore the feature so Elon can “own the lib media” by commenting “false, it is still there” on the tweet of the original story.
It’s even accompanied by a “community note” stating that “Elon confirmed this statement is false”. Lol.
