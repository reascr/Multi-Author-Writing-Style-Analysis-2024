He's not pushing for votes (the GOP shoved him into a new deep blue district because his first election he won in a real red district). He's literally just there to learn about queer lives and take our concerns back to the Leg. Not that it does shit in Texas.
He's got a real Fetterman vibe -- he was just a small business owner until Trump was elected, and he saw that twerp divide up his social circle, demonize good people, and generally fracture things and felt he couldn't stand helpless and wanted to do something.
He does the same for several other groups, as he feels he needs all that experience to really represent a diverse district.
He's probably too progressive (for Texas) to run for Senate, and he's older, but he seems focused on helping other candidates and at least agitating for better legislation and not higher office.
Don't get me wrong, he sounds like a stand-up guy, but listening to your constituents(all of them, not just the ones who like you) and working to advocate for their interests should be the baseline standard for any elected representative.
