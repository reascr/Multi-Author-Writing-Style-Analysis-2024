You heard the story of him crashing the ribbon cutting for a nursery school for children with AIDS? It'll be like that.
That’s the thing. The MAGA people don’t like leftists, but we basically did what we were supposed to do by voting for Democrats.
What happens next is that the right wing machine will try to convince Trump supporters to switch over to DeSantis. Some of them will switch, but some of them won’t. The primary will be brutal, and the Trump and DeSantis camps will get mad at each other. This will create animosity that will make it harder for supporters to switch camps later.
DeSantis will pick up more of Trump’s supporters after the primary victory, but the fighting will just make Trump’s remaining supporters even more adamant. DeSantis will pick up the overwhelming majority of the Republican vote, but Trump will get somewhere around 10%, and that will be enough to sink DeSantis.
But unless the GOP successfully consolidate the anti-Trump base around one person (DeSantis), then we'll have the same situation as 2016 where Trump kept winning states with a plurality in the 30-40 percent range.
