The company will lose control over the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special favor given to Walt Disney World by the state in the 1960s. Instead of Disney choosing the five members of the board, which acts as a county government, the five will be chosen by DeSantisBut the new improvement district will still have the same tax benefits it had before, such as the ability to issue tax-exempt bonds and other measures that have saved the company millions of dollars.
DeSantis gets to say he won against woke Disney, and Disney gets to use its already present lobbying influence to pick board members for the state appointed oversight committee.
My claim is that Disney is still probably going to pick or have massive influence in board members because of their lobbying power.
So the new board has an extremely strong reason to do whatever Disney wants, and no leverage to do much else.
Disney will say something like , "We were unable to come to an agreement about the district's budget with the intransigent board the governor put into place to punish business. It is unfortunate that the new district defaulted on the 1.2 billion dollar debt, but the board gave us no opportunity to pay it.".
So you are against this then. Because government passing laws to put it's appointed people in charge of the boards of large companies sure doesn't seem very "small government" to me. Or is it just a convenient fall back to say that when the people you like do things you like, no way can they be corrupt. Everyone wants small government until they get punched in the face....
