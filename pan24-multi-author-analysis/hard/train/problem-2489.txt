This sounds like some religious whitewashing trying to imply that religion was somehow more reasonable than non religious people. Whereas AT BEST it was crazy religious people vs somewhat less religious nuts.
The tortures and depravity of religious zealots are unsurpassed in history. Anytime you have people "on a mission from God" awful things are bound to happen.
I don't give a shit about getting "hammered", what I've stated is factual. The notion that there were secular courts in 1500 is ludicrous. All power / decisions came from high up with the moral compass of "God", there wasn't even a fucking explicitly secular government until the US Constitution.
In 1542 there was no option of being secular, it was just degrees of which you believed the bullshit created by men.
ðŸ¤£ WTF is this bullshit?? Secular courts in 1542??? Where was this? Next to the microbiology and quantum research lab???
Right? The US could have Khamâ€™s head in an hour but thatâ€™d just kick off another massive war. The man has half the country that adore him on religion alone. The US also doesnâ€™t do things like that altruistically. If it not going to net a large profit or damaging a real enemy of the US, it wonâ€™t ever happen. Ukraine gets equipment because it harms Russia every day this war goes in. If it was some random country in the area, there would be absolutely no aid.
