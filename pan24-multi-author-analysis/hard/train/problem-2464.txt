My point is that the comment I replied to was written under this socialist mindset. Wanting to abolish the Department of Education does not mean that you want people illiterate.
That's also part of why they want to cripple public education, so they can tmsend their kids to private institutions and the peasants can go to the fucking mines.
But yet, this idiot has been fighting hard to move education funds to private schools in kentucky. Which would only increase this issue. Believe it or not, Kentucky doesn't allow this, and just recently, the bill to accomplish this did not pass.
As a teacher who lives and teaches in his district, he is just mind-boggling stupid. For one, kentucky has a serious issue with school funding at the moment. Schools here are funded through SEEK, which basically is that each student that attended gets a dollar amount to the school, and students with IEPs have a dollar amount that is increased by a multiplier. It was actually amazing when it was created as it helped schools to run based properly on their population. The problem is that those funds never increased with inflation, so now schools are hemerging money and have to go to property taxes to meet the difference, which only widens the gap and introduces class segregation.
Also, providing private schools, tax payer funds is the most anti libertarian stance I have ever heard.
This is only scratching the surface of his push for school choice. It's not even touching the work the DoE actually does, and it's important to provide higher education to lower income students.
