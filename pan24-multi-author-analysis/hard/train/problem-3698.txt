I hear that, and I hope it is true. makes it hard for me to feel like it’s as true as various Texas Dems I’ve met seem to feel.
(And trust me, I really, really want Texas to go blue: PA born, but a sibling and their family transplanted there for work years ago, and aren’t GOP).
I understand the sentiment but there's a huge population of Texas that is blue/minority/etc that wouldn't support secession and would horribly suffer if it were to happen.
The problem is that if the state government secedes, real people will be affected—including people who aren’t fascists (which is the majority, but Texas is currently under minority rule).
The de facto regime of the region formerly known as "Texas" has engaged in such extreme voter suppression efforts that it no longer qualifies for statehood, which requires each state to have a republican government.
But who knows with some of the people Trump has managed to get into the judiciary. We're talking about people who would struggle to pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel.
