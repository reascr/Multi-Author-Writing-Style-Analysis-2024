?? There is more human life than ever. Most of that is due to modern capitalism and all the pollution is causes, due to fossil fuel fertilizers and diesel fueled global trade.
The thing is that the only reason that there was massive growth in population, was because there was a massive drop in mortality from a variety of causes like hunger and disease, mostly decimated (temporarily) by economic growth and technological progress.
There are no good answers here. It's a bit like the Live Aid thing for Ethiopia. We had Live Aid in 1980 for 35 million Ethiopians at risk of starvation, and another one in the 2000s for 80 million Ethiopians at risk of starvation, and today there are 140 million. What is more moral? To help them survive and avoid starvation but have more people die later due to unsustainable population growth, or to just let them starve right now where they are now? There is no right answer imo.
My whole point is that there is no answer. It's too late. We fucked the duck, and having a bunch of people around for it is just gonna mean a bunch of people are around to suffer. I'm not saying we should kill them or some shit. I'm saying it doesn't matter, it won't fix the problem.
