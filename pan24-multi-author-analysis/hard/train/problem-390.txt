Yes. Honestly with modern printing processes we could go back to radium paint. The amount used on a watch or clock is fine to be around.
Ionization ones are better at detecting really hot fires quickly, while light based smoke detectors are better at detecting smoldering fires that produce a lot of smoke.
Ionization smoke-detectors and photoelectric (not "infrared") smoke-detectors each work better with different types of smoke.
Ionization smoke detectors still use radioactive materials, and detect the ionized gases emitted from fires/hot objects.
