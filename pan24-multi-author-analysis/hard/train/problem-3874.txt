If he gets the nomination without Trump's blessing, Trump will insure that DeSantis and the GoP loses. (glee).
Trump's base liked to imagine themselves as Trump. Trump is a big guy, mean, intimidating, and has charisma, and presence.
The thing is, Trump is very unlikable to a lot of us, but he's got a certain charisma. A shitty charisma sure, but still the sort of thing that can stand out and be entertaining and give him a (fake) man of the people aesthetic. I've even seen some liberals and progressives basically say something to the extent that it would be nice to have an asshole like Trump if he stood up for good things rather than bad things.
DeSantis doesn't necessarily have that sort of appeal. Like, he does policy that gets conservatives happy, but he's not necessarily doing the sort of rallies that really get conservatives all active and excited and stuff. He may just not have that sort of ability to work a crowd and to get people to really think he stands out above other shitty but kinda dull conservatives.
