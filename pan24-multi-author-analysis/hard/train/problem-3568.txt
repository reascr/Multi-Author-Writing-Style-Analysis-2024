However, maritime experts say the way the UK registers imports, as well as the increased use of ship-to-ship transfers, will make it difficult for the UK to sanction Russian oil.
The has been copied to its discussion over in /r/europe, and makes it a bit clearer (and also goes into the ship-to-ship transfers):
This information is collated by the ONS. However, it is the country of dispatch that is used to measure the nationality of an import, not the country where it was produced. This means a cargo of Chinese-made goods could be registered as being from Germany if it were imported to the UK by a German firm.
The oil came to the UK on ships owned by, among others, a German Company. Other nations involved a Belgium, the Netherlands and Greece. Some of the oil was offloaded from Russian ships onto EU-registered ones out on sea, illegally evading sanctions. Broadly this worked because the UK goes by selling country rather than producing country when it comes to oil imports. Those have rules have since been changed specifically because of these incidents.
