I imagine the Iraq Iran war, and the invasion of Kuwait, would have turned out much differently if Iraq had become a nuclear power.
It is funny how most of the world was pro-Iraq (including both the US and the USSR) in this war, with Israel being among the few who did something beneficial to Iran instead.
Not only this, but Iran also shared with Israel its intelligence (gathered when Iran did a partially successful airstrike on the same reactor a year ago), according to at least one source. Israel used this information to complete the job, coming from the unexpected western direction, as most of Iraq military was facing the East - Iran.
Even after revolution there was a peculiar case of cooperation between Iran and Israel to damage Iraq nuclear program. Iran (after being invaded by Iraq) stroke first, damaged it, shared info from their experience with Israel, which used it to finish the job with their own airstrike.
But the truth is they have bombed nuclear facilities before,Iranâ€™s being one of them. Not sure why this is shocking news lol. I would bet Israel pilots have been practicing this exact bombing run the very second it became operational.
