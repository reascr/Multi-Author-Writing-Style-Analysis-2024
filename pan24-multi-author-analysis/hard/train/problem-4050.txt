As an another example of recent science adding yet another positive feedback, see this research on cloud cover which shows that as ocean temperatures warm, cloud cover that reflects sunlight reduces, meaning more warming.
We are at in very grave peril. We have to fight for solutions together. We need to decarbonise human activity as fast as possible, like our civilisation depends on it, because it does. If we don't fix this now, there will be no politics to argue about in a few decades.
And here is more recent research that shows that as we cut CO2 emissions and aerosols, we slow down his quickly methane breaks down in the atmosphere, leading to more warming than previously predicted.
> Our results suggest that avoiding high-end climate risks is possible only for low-temperature overshoots [over 1.5C] and if long-term temperatures stabilize at or below todayâ€™s levels of global warming.
There is no evidence for projected warming <3-4C of any tipping points that significantly change the warming trajectory. Read IPCC report and read what scientists say instead of speculating-.
