Plenty of people embrace economic thought from people like von mises, Hayek, rothbard, and Friedman. That's because economics is as much political ideology as social science. Bourgeois economics attempts to create a society where the capitalist class can own profitable capital and distribute goods through a marketplace. These people demand less government action so there will be more opportunities for direct involvement by capitalist ventures, and more freedom of action for those ventures.
They definitely have no problem lying about scenarios to increase wages through market competition or lower taxes. This strain of thought is the leading ideology of both political parties, as both the Republican and Democrats have no issues embracing neoliberalism at home, even if some of the republicans can't get the Anarcho capitalism they may want.
The Democratic Party is basically the de facto “normal conservative” party at this point and the republicans are just “fascism 2: this time it’s personal the party”.
The educated became more and more offended as the sexists and racists took over the Republican, found that the Democratic party also has a wing for conservative economics, and moved to the Democratic party.
This is why the Republicans are no longer the party of conservative economics. They have been taken over by uneducated people who think thats all conservative economics is.
They have convinced uneducated people that the last 40 years of trickle on economics has been beneficial to them, and if it hasn't it's because of liberals.
