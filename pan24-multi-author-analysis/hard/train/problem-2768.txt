I was at the Manhattan DA’s Office from 2012 to 2017, working for a special narcotics unit doing trials and wiretap investigations.

In New York, we also have recent reporting that the Manhattan DA’s office has a grand jury looking into Trump now. So, again, like Georgia, that doesn’t guarantee that Trump will be charged there, either, but it helps to explain why he hasn’t been charged there yet if he will be.
My argument doesn't contend that the investigations have to take this long or that there's no way they could’ve charged him earlier.
My argument is that an investigation taking a long time does not indicate that said investigation is purely political or won't result in criminal charges.
