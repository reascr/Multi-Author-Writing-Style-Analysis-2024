Um ok let’s not whitewash Ukrainian participation in these pogroms. Ukraine was particularly harsh and violent towards Jews, and the percentage of Ukrainians that collaborated with the Nazis and participated in the holocaust is immense.
Solzhenitsyn further alleged that the theory that the Holodomor was a genocide which only victimized the Ukrainian people was created decades later by believers in an anti-Russian form of extreme Ukrainian nationalism. Solzhenitsyn also cautioned that the ultranationalists' claims risked being accepted without question in the West due to widespread ignorance and misunderstanding there of both Russian and Ukrainian history”.

"One of the most famous Soviet dissidents, Solzhenitsyn was an outspoken critic of communism and helped to raise global awareness of political repression in the Soviet Union, in particular the Gulag system.".
