Even with this, Israel can launch drone attacks on Iran, but Iran likely can't get through Israel's "iron dome" that Americans pay for instead of healthcare for Americans.
But that was their same excuse for killing that journalist, then we found out the only people that fired were IDF...
Wasn’t their excuse ‘an armed conflict broke out with a terrorist group, and Palestinians civilians were killed in the crossfire’? Your comment completely left out the fact that there was an armed clash between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian combatants.
As far as Palestinian is concerned Israel is occupying on their land and Israel of course claim otherwise.
I'm sorry, do you forget the multiple nations that also border them that wants to wipe out Israel? The only thing stopping them is Israel's military and if they didn't have that you cannot pretend that Palestine wouldn't ally with them to wipe Israel off the map.
But my comment didn’t imply Palestinians shouldn’t have guns. I said “armed Palestinians” and I also said “armed Israeli soldiers”. The Palestinians weren’t part of an army, so I didn’t use the word “soldiers”.
But since you’re bringing it up, no I don’t think Palestinians should have guns. Nor do I think Israelis should have guns. Nor do I think Americans should have guns.
