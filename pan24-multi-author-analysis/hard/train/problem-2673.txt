Then, when the issue is voluntary drag shows that nobody is forced to attend, those same conservatives suddenly insist that parents shouldn't even have the right to bring their kids.
The people fighting tooth and nail against drag shows and LGBTQ representation in schools are terrified of their kids being comfortable with queer people. They're terrified of their kids spending time around gay, nonbinary, or transgender people and realizing that they're perfectly decent human beings whose sexuality and gender identity don't pose a threat to anybody. In short, they're terrified of their kids realizing that the bigoted stuff they've been taught at home about queer people is all a lie. THAT'S what this is about. Not parents' rights, not grooming - it's about homophobic parents being TERRIFIED that their kids are going to grow up to be more accepting than they are.
When the issue is LGBTQ discussions in school, conservatives act like their only concern is parents' rights. "I just think a child's parents should get to decide when and how they're introduced to LGBTQ topics, not their teachers.".
How can anyone look at this and be like “Yep. You know what, drag shows are the 1 problem in the US right now. Fuck inflation and gun control and inequality and all that other dumb shit. It’s 100% drag shows.”?
Just another classic case of conservatives fear mongering dipshit voters into believing in issues that don’t really exist.
