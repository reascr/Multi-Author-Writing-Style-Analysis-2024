I don’t think any Republicans that have a chance of winning the primary will actually announce a run unless It either seriously looks like Trump is going to wind up in prison, or he just gets disqualified under the 14th.
I don’t think indictment will stop Trump from running, but it’ll kill his chances at the general election and someone will be forced to step in anyway to try to defuse what looks like an unwinnable situation.
They know he’s a political suicide bomber- he’s either going to beat you and end your career, or he loses, claims he was cheated, and runs independently, ending the relevancy for the whole party.
He shouldn't run as an independent, what if he takes away votes from those Democrats who secretly want to support him but can't because they would never vote Republican It'd make those libs cry Trump supporters are a silent majority, you know!
His ego won’t allow someone else to have all the attention and glory, he would burn the GOP down to the ground before he would let another person be the nominee.
He'll go for trying to be the GOP nominee, if it's obvious he can't win, he will say it's rigged and launch as an independent. Both GOP and Trump lose, Biden (or whomever at that point) wins and Trump can claim that the GOP should have gone with him instead.
I read a great line somewhere: Trump will rather have Biden in the White House for 1000 years than DeSantis for 5 minutes.
