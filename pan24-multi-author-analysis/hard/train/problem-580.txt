No its not. France and Germany bet on economic interdependence to convince Putin not to be an imperial aggressor in Europe. As the war was ramping up, France and Germany were the least prepared to confront Putin's aggressive plans because of what it would mean for German energy markets.
Germany needs to act like a true leader in the Western world and do what is necessary to secure Europe from armed invasions and annexations.
It's not a fair play. Not only is Germany refusing to send THEIR tanks, but they are prohibiting other countries (Poland) from sending Polish tanks.
Germany is reluctant to be tough on Russia because of the horrors they inflicted on the USSR, and don't want German tanks to be used there.
I think if Germany gave the tanks they'd be helping defend against the imperialism their country once inflicted on Europe.
What Germany has that the US doesn't is several hundred main battle tanks on the ground in Europe. Our Abrams tanks would have to be shipped half way around the world.
