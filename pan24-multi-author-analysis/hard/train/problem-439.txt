This news prompted me to look up US stats. Apparently there have been 15,000 deaths in the past month. Ofc, Japan now has more deaths/capita but it just goes to show how the pandemic is still very much alive but as long we are not locked down and the media doesn't talk about it, it is like an alternate reality.
If mask mandates and social distancing were enforced with no lockdowns, would the situation really be that much worse?
For those of us who wfh, the impact of the lockdowns may not seem like much. But there are many people whose lives and small businesses have forever been impacted by them. I seriously don't think any government would want to lockdown over any pandemic in future after this.
Had no lockdowns been instituted in the first place, perhaps there wouldn't have been any need for that much of an economic hit and the debt fuelled stimulus spendings.
Had no lockdowns been instituted before vaccines or even masks were a viable option way more people would have died which would have hit the economy significantly worse and likely would have lead to even more "debt fueled stimulus spendings.".
