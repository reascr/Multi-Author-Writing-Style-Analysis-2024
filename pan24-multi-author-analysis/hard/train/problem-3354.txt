Yes 18 months. It's not a full time gig, just a few days a month. It was originally supposed to be 12 months but they extended us because of a relatively large case we were working on. We were allowed to leave for lunch. It was like an ordinary 8 hour job. Be there by nine, 1 hour lunch 12-1, leave at 5. They paid $40 a day in the beginning and it later moved to $50 a day. We also got paid mileage and if it was more than X miles they would pay for a hotel if we wanted one.
Nope. Not allowed to discuss any details. I guess we could talk about whatever became public after it went to trial but there were several cases that I wouldn't want the accused knowing that I was a part of the Grand Jury that indicted them.
ELI5: Isn't a regular grand jury empaneled only for indictments just a special grand jury with extra steps? What restricted the special grand jury from making indictments? Why would they need a whole new and separate group of people to decide on indictments, who weren't part of the investigative jury?
The special grand jury, however, cannot issue indictments. They can only offer recommendations and write a final report.
A regular grand jury has no present judge, no defense, no appeals. A new one does not need to be empaneled. Only 12 out of up to 23 grand jurors need to vote to return an indictment, and it doesn’t have anywhere near the bar required for conviction. Indictment is simply saying “there is probable cause from the evidence provided and a trial is needed to determine guilt.”.
