We'll see if Trump crazy town team goes down with the big civil lawsuits, including Fox and Newsmax.
Lawyers need to be sanctioned, and politicians should be liable both criminally and civilly for their actions. Lake may have violated some Arizona election laws with some of the information she put on social media.
It is time to start holding more people accountable for unjustly casting doubt on our election processes.
If you choose to be dishonest and take a stance that there is no voter fraud, that is your choice. I choose to admit there are some instances of voter fraud, just not enough to sway much more than maybe a small town city council election.
Uh huh.... and voter fraud occurs so infrequently and so insignificantly that when there is a problem it becomes national news like what some GOP operatives did in North Carolina.
What this really does, other than divide our country, is make it really hard for people with VALID claims of voter fraud to be taken seriously, because they get lumped in with these alt-right morons.
