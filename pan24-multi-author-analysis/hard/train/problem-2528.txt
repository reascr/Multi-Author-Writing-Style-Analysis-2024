Russia was never held accountable for their alliance with Hitler or their atrocious crimes on the way to and in Germany, because they helped defeat the Nazis.
When Germany under Hitler went un punished for the siezing aka liberation of other country's. It just continued, until the point something had to be done. So again today, instead of doing something real, rich elites all over the world who hold powerful decisions to make a change, hold hands and make show. They do not have empathy for the death of women and children. They do not have empathy for death of innocent people. If they had empathy, they'd stand together and stop the Hitler like leaders and killers of the world with a large and quick calculated decapitation. It's just a show folks. Putin is a murderer, ehat would they do to you if you murdered thst many people?
If Nazi Germany had nukes, the point of doing something wouldn't have existed, because they wouldn't have hesitated to use them. And we probably wouldn't be using reddit today, because the course of history would've most likely been changed drastically but that's all theoretical.
