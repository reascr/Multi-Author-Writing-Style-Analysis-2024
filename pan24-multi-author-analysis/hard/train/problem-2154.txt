You're describing the cause, not the thing itself. People dropping someone or something en masse is being cancelled. The boycott or social media campaign that led to it is what caused it. The GOP senator in question is still a member of the GOP because she still has their support. She's still one of them. If she's still considered one of them then she cannot, by definition, be cancelled.
Has she been recalled? Is she out of a job and out of the party? No. She has not been cancelled. Someone made an official statement claiming that they don't agree with her decision. That is quite literally all that happened. Nothing more. Cancelled = you no longer work in this industry.
If you need an example of what being cancelled actually looks like, check out Kevin Spacey. One allegation and he was fired from his own show. That's being cancelled.
So this situation is also called cancel. In fact even Merriam Webster defines cancelled as stopped giving support:
That is not what cancel means at all... Cancel is when a group express disapproval thru means available to them, like social media or boycotts.
