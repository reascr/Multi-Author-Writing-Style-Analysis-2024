To be fair, if word gets out that they're child rapists, they might catch a stray friendly bullet to the back of the head. "Accidents" are not uncommon in a war zone. Unless they create special child molesters units. In which case... that's even more fucked up.
That’s messed up mate. I smoked a joint with my mates in the park. Two coppers were making their rounds, smelt it, just looked at us and said “Come on. Guys, there are kids around. Put it out or go somewhere else.” Swear to god, my heart was pounding so fast that we legged it to a nearby lake. The copper was pretty calm about the whole thing.
Wait wait… so let me get this straight. Because your mates and you were just curious about a spooky house, explored it, got caught, you have a permanent record? You served 7 years… does that mean you went to prison for 7 years? Or is it more like for 7 years, you can’t commit another offence or risk going to prison?
The whole point of you going to prison is to be reformed and to come out a better person. However, this segregation will only lead to more crime because of how you’re treated and given less opportunities due to the system….
That’s all good mate but I’m still shocked at how it’s considered a felony! Sorry to hear that you’re classed as a lower classed person for life. I honestly think it’s messed up….
