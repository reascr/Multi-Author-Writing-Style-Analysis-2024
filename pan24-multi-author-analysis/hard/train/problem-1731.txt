Worldwide demand is what sets the price of oil. If gas prices are too high in Europe, then they should release some of their reserves to keep prices down.
They want us to sell them gas at a lower price. US natural gas is about 4 to 5 times the price in Europe as it is here, though a lot of that just because of the fact that it's much more expensive to compress and ship LNG than just just use pipeline like we do here, or like Russia did to Europe before the war, and still does to some extent.
The US is so far doing well in this war. Expensive gas in Europe is making the US more competitive in industry, and the IRA tipped the balance even more. We're setting up to benefit at least in the mid-term at the expense of our ostensible allies in Europe, and their leaders are starting to get wise to it.
As Kissinger said "America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests." As long as NATO is beneficial to the US the US will defend the territorial integrity of NATO member nations. If Russia were to intentionally attack a NATO country I expect the US to honor it's commitments. (I also suspect Russia recognizes this and will do (and so far has done) everything to avoid escalating beyond Ukraine into NATO countries.).
