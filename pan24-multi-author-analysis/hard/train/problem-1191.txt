I think you mean the whole middle east. The whole point of making things war crimes is to keep everyone at the same level of morality, if your enemy isn't abiding by them, you can defend yourself without doing some things that don't look bad without the proper context. For example, you can rightfully claim the Israel shoots rockets into civilian areas in Gaza, but because Hamas isn't following international law, there are legitimate military targets in the civilian areas which brings Israel to strike there to begin with.
But the reality is that it's been decades now where Palestinians (At least a huge % of them) hold incredible grudge against Israel, still refuse to even acknowledge it's right to exist and are under some delusion that they can still kick us out of here.
Palestinians need to realize that whatever leadership was/is in place there isn't working for them, instead of holding on to the belief that only Israel is to blame, and to blame in the amount the UN, among others, suggests, at least in subtext, but often blatantly.
And it puts Israel in a light that makes Israel ignore them entirely, and validates Palestinian propaganda that's extremely unhelpful to any sort of lasting solution.
There is a clear bias against Israel but it isn't due to any particular hatred, just fifty years of pent up annoyance and ire stemming from a conflict that will not end and the only party of that conflict in the UN technically, is Israel. So it has become modus operandi to just condem them over and over and over again. Fifty years is a long time for an issue to still be prevalent.
