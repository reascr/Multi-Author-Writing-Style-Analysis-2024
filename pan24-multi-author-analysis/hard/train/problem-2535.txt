Now the media is trying to help rehabilitate the GOP by pretending that Trump was just “a thing that happened to them” and not a 6 year litmus test that they failed every single day proving their own lack of basic morality. They saw who Trump was, and they bent the knee because it was their path to power. They will make that same choice over and over again.
This article makes the same basic fundamental mistake they always do: They are treating Trump and the GOP as separate entities with different values.
Articles that try to make and argument that Republicans can separate form Trump are so missing the point. Republicans are free to pretend like they aren't Trump but they proved that they would bend their knees for an overgrown child. They would comply if threatened by someone who had no actual authority over them. They obeyed his every back and call. Trump is them and they are Trump.
I'm tearing up at the idea that anyone thinks Republicans aren't Trump and Trump ain't Republicans. They will never successfully remove the orange stain.
