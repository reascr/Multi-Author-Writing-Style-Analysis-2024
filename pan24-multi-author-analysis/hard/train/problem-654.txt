No no, it's only gambling if you and I are doing it, because when we lose it's our problem. But when the banks and investment firms do it, it's the government's problem. Which usually means it's back to the taxpayer's problem.
I’m listing wasteful things the government has spent on. I am fully aware national debt is not always terrible. It is also a legitimate point to say the current national debt is a case study in insanely bad proportions.
National Debt is not always a terrible thing and it definitely not something like business or personal debt. Want to know why? The fucking currency that you use to speak about this matters is controlled by the Government.
Oh wow, dude so you're just listing out things that the Government is spending on and then saying that it's increasing the debt?
The problem is, Congress spends more than it takes in, so the debt is ever increasing, and there is a separate law saying the national debt shall not exceed x dollars.
To make matters more interesting, the constitution also specifies that the debt of the US is not to be questioned, so the constitution says: president must spend this money, must pay our debts on time. And statutory law says he can’t do either if we hit some made up limit. There is a nontrivial argument that the debt limit is unconstitutional, but if a president were to ignore the statutory debt limit, it would create uncertainty, which would likely cause our credit rating to decrease anyway.
Once we hit the debt limit, they can’t issue new bonds to pay debts, so they resort to some accounting tricks to buy a few months (the government itself holds about 20% of its own debt, which it can shuffle around to avoid missing debt payments).
The government needs to pay existing bond holders when those bonds come due, and they can do this via cash or issuing new bonds (increasing debt).
