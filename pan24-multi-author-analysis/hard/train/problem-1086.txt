I have no problem with Twitter as a source to get quotes from subjects — my problem is with Twitter as a source (especially the only source) for public opinion or reaction.
Ah, so it’s like an editorial instinct that you’re having a hard time suppressing. I get that. You’re wrong, in this case. Wildly, actually, as you’d be able to see through a very, very small amount of research. Like one google search small. So maybe don’t go into editing.
Have you ever been invited to the palace as a minority who has been repeatedly asked this question over your life — often by people who are only interested in parsing out how you don’t fit in and are different — only to hear the same question from a representative of the royal family? Maybe you have, and maybe your experience was different. You weren’t traumatized. She was. Wanting to understand how and why trauma can result from this type of interaction is totally valid. But “knowing” how we’d react to a certain situation isn’t enough to justify calling someone else a liar, which is sorta where we’re headed with this. For a bad analogy, consider someone having an allergic reaction — you might brush off a bee sting as no big deal; but others might literally die. Or someone who’s been badly beaten — one more hit could be lethal for them, whereas you’d be perfectly fine. Well for many people they’ve taken hits their whole lives and one hit like this, in such a setting? Of course that’s going to be traumatic.
So yes, this would be traumatizing, because the questions open deep existential wounds. Work in your empathy, people.
