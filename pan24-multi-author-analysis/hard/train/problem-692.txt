So many videos of Russian boys dying needlessly, all of them set to some sort of bizarre eastern European techno and edited to present to us in perfect bite size pieces.. And the bloodthirst from what is otherwise a heavily left-leaning and generally peacenik website is amazing.
Look, I get Russian invaded Ukraine. I get that Russia's claims on certain regions is tenuous in some circumstances (and completely correct in at least one, although this still isn't the way to do it) but the bizarre propaganda rush we've been seeing pro-Ukraine is just crazy.
People still get upset if I compare how Russian and Ukrainian culture are still pretty similar; a lot of sentiment is very partisan to build up a rally cry for gathering support.
Because people on here are blindly supporting Ukraine regardless of the context, so anything that might make them look bad gets met with serious vitriol.
They're not even attacking military targets, they just want to cause suffering to the people of Ukraine.
To add a bit of accuracy to your statement they launched more missiles than ever before at Ukraine and obviously at civilian targets. The missile landing in Poland distracted from that.
