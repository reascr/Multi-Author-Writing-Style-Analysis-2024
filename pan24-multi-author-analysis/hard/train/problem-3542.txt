Baltic countries and Poland would really enjoy sending their full military might against starving and underequipped russian troops.
No, Georgia and Moldova are next steps. We all know what the capabilities of russian military are, they'd stand no chance against Baltic militaries which are backed by NATO.
Russia is also quite proficient at sabotage, and if this was their work, it is not the first time they did it on NATO countries. They do this constantly.
NATO doesn't want to start direct war with Russia. What happened in Poland is example of that. A rocket striking Poland was chalked as Ukrainian AA defense after they thought for a day what to say.
Russia was still behind the S-300 missile that hit Poland. It was fired at Russian missiles that were targeting civilian infrastructure in a country that they are actively invading and committing genocide in. If Russia doesnâ€™t try to kill Ukrainian civilians then that missile never lands in Poland.
Yeah but there was also little advantage to invading Ukraine. Just because we don't see any advantage it doesn't mean someone hasn't blown enough smoke up their superiors arse to make it sounds like a good idea.
