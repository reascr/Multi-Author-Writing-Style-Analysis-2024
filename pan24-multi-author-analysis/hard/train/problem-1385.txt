For real though, it’s like business schools stopped teaching people how to competently and sustainably grow their businesses. They refuse to reinvest in talent, R&D, process improvements, etc. It’s stock buybacks and cutting corners and nothing else. At what point do we end the incompetence?
Yeah but that at least has the fig leaf of trying to prevent a full depression. There’s some kind of economic theory behind it rather than strictly greed.
Corporate greed is one of the main drivers of inflation, yet people don't acknowledge this very often.
Because it’s much easier to get away with price increases when there is general inflation across the economy.
Inflation would be even higher if it was worked out on per 100g of a product vs what it was pre shrinkflation of product sizes.
Instead it’s on a whole packet size, which although has went up 10-15% from last year, that packet is 20-25% smaller than it was the year before that.
Manufacturers shrank their products by 10-20% in size in their greed for growth, remember this, growth in profits, not just making a profit is enough for them, they need and want to have profit growth to appease share price.
