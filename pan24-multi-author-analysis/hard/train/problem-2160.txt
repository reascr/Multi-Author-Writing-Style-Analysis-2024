However this part of the story doesn't make sense and implies they're the ones who needed title insurance/lost money so I'm confused:
"It also doesn't account for the house being sold under market value ... if fraudsters are looking to make a quick buck," said Derrick. "You get what it's sold for, not what it's worth.".
Now I'm so confused by the story and the law. Why would a home owner need title insurance for an existing home. Normally its a one time title insurance cost at house closing.
Weird, I'd think the owners are the third party and not the buyer's. When I closed on my house, I thought my title insurance was for protecting me from title fraud as the buyer. It's odd that it's also for protecting me in the future as a fictitious seller, that should be the responsibility of the future buyer.
You misunderstand. The home owner doesn't get paid anything, because they didn't lose anything. They still have their house, so they don't need to get paid the value of the home. It would be the buyer's that would be protected via their title insurance.
Protects your purchase in the event of a fraudulent sale. Anyone can sell you a house, but if they don’t have the title of the house then you’ll never actually own it. The insurance protects you in the event that the sale was fraudulent, not in good faith, or becomes contested for whatever reason (happens sometimes with property disputes, bequeathments, that kinda stuff).
