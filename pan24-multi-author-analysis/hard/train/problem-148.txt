My last US address was in Cobb, so I'm very glad they provided the UOCAVA ballots electronically, or else I might never have gotten mine at all either. Just have to hope my completed ballot actually made it, I guess, since I can't check. Then again, it's not like I could do anything about it at this point if it didn't, I suppose; it'd be a little difficult to vote in person when I'm thousands of miles from my polling place...
Been trying to access the Georgia election portal site for the past few days to check on the status of my mail-in ballot (that I sent in a few weeks ago; was able to request an electronic ballot, fortunately, since it was a UOCAVA ballot), but I just keep getting 403 errors. Looks like they've now geo-blocked non-US IPs, from testing with a few US-based proxies, so that's a nice little "fuck you" to us overseas voters. At least they didn't come up with that idea before I put in my ballot request originally, I suppose.
As for sample ballots, this is the first time that I recall having received them. It was great because I was able to fill it out, take a screenshot, and then go vote knowing I had researched the people and amendments for whom I needed to vote.
I live in south Florida currently having moved from North Carolina. I voted by mail in NC and my husband voted by mail here in Florida. Both times we had to request the ballots specifically.
