The Republican party is basically bought by Putin and we all know that once they take the House and/or Senate the funding for Ukraine, and the weapons will stop and instead they will try to impeach Biden for it.
The Kremlin literally spent hundreds of Millions of US dollars funneled through the NRA directly to sitting GOP senators and house members. They literally flipped 180-degrees overnight after getting the Millions of dollars, in some cases on camera days later saying the exact opposite thing they had adamantly maintained prior to getting a talk with their benefactors. Then as soon as they heard what was required for their new funding, they start word-for-word repeating Russian propoganda talking points, quoting RT, and voting for everything Putin wants and against anything that would limit his reach in the world.
The GOP are bought and owned by Russia. They spent the 4th of July in Moscow getting facetime with their handlers, and more funding.
It's so well documented that even comedians have made montages of the events and outlined it very clearly showing a timeline of events that are found in the public record.
Yes, they're worried about literal Russian assets, who spent the 4th of July in Moscow getting their marching orders directly from the Kremlin, taking over the most powerful nation in the coalition to help them FIGHT the Russian invasion. The same people that blackmailed Ukraine by withholding foreign aid and weapons illegally for sleazy political posturing. Yes, Ukraine is worried. The WORLD is worried. The GOP is literally insane and would dismantle NATO and serve up Ukraine on a silver platter to a dying Putin.
