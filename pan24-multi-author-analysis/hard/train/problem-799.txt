I know your joking but this is not a tack we should take as it plays in GOP hands by both downplaying what she was actually doing and normalizing actual police overuse of violence.
What she shouldn’t have done is break through police lines, break into a federal building, and then bash through an officer erected door barricade made in a last stand position and start climbing through it an attempt to kill the Vice President and members of congress.
Likely only because they don't want to set a precedent that climbing through the broken glass of a locked door to the floor of Congress while government agents tell you to stop with weapons drawn is acceptable.
Same Republican congressperson: “if someone breaks windows and forces there way into a federal building and disobeys orders to stop, then they are a hero. The person paid to defend the building and the congresspersons within it should be put on trial if they shoot and kill this ‘hero’”.
Republican congressperson: “if a bad guy is on my property, then I’m allowed to shoot them dead. This is my castle!”.
