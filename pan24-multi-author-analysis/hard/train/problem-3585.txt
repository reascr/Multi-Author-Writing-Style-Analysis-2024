Now, the Trump situation is different in many ways. Namely the presence of SCIF-level documents (these are definitely not over-classified), and his denial in having and obstruction in returning the documents. And his lax security measures, basically storing everything in rooms that just about anyone could freely access.
Yes. And when everything is classified it becomes a lot harder to differentiate between “this stuff is actually a national security secret” and “this stuff is minutes from a meeting the press sat in on and reported about thoroughly.”.
I suspect the reason nobody cared about these classified documents before was because the real national security stuff is so tightly controlled that there was no possible way for it to end up in Biden's or Pence's boxes. No need to check Biden's outgoing box for nuclear secrets because NARA knows exactly where the nuclear secrets are at every moment of every day.
If Biden or Pence staff packed up their offices and stored them away in boxes that neither former VP ever had any reason to look through for years, I personally wouldn't consider either VP to be on the hook for gross negligence. But I don't know how the law assigns gross negligence culpability in this kind of case.
If anything this helps to diffuse some of the both-sidesing. Instead of POTUS vs. POTUS it's now two former VPs who have discovered (probably) accidental mishandling and responded appropriately and honestly vs. a former POTUS who did it on purpose and tried to hide and obstruct.
Certainly will be harder to argue the case is purely partisan when Biden and Pence, both VPs who seemingly accidentally held onto a few documents, are cleared of criminal wrongdoing.
