Yes, absolutely. It’s only going to get worse for the GOP as my generation gets older, and that’s really the only thing giving me hope right now. I don’t know a single Gen Z person who voted red in the CA primary or the midterms—and I live in a fairly conservative area.
I’m gay Gen Z and despite holding many conservative views, I will always vote democrat for the foreseeable future. I will always vote to protect my own rights as a queer man, even if I’m not a big fan of the other democrat policies.
I volunteer to get out the vote for Democrats. If you give a shit, make sure everyone one of your likeminded friends votes. Every election. The small stuff (school boards) is incredibly important. Those elections get 10% turnout. The midterms get 40-60%. Presidential maybe 60-70%. I guarantee you know people who don’t vote and getting them to vote would make a huge difference.
What’s worse is that a large enough portion of the population doesn’t even care that the people they voted for are doing this stuff. Or even worse, the do care, and they agree with it!
