True, but we tend not to elect crazies. Baker is the last of the Republican moderates in political life in the state. He is popular in the state, but the MA Republican party (which is small) took a hard turn right because of Trump, and Baker would not have survived a far-right primary challenge, though he would probably won in the general election. Baker is probably near Biden or Agnus King on the political continuum.
What will happen is what happened to Angus King, they will become Independents. It is not like there aren't conservative to right leaning groups throught New England. Vermont has its survivalist community, Maine's second district, New Hampshire - well its New Hampshire. Here in MA, the areas around Springfield are red-ish, but they are diluted by Springfield and the college towns just to the North, which are both solid blue. And it is not strictly urban/rural. The Berkshires is very rural, but vote deep blue.
A true conservative Republican governor would not stand a chance here. Our legislatures have veto proof Democrat majorities. We have 40 senators - 37 are Democrats, 160 in the General Court (our lower chamber), 139 are Democrats. Baker has worked well with them, though of course they don't agree on everything.
MA is not alone, VT has a Republican governor who like Baker is a moderator - socially liberal, fiscally conservative. In fact moderate Republican governors once was the norm throughout New England.
Massachusetts has a very blue legislature so sometimes want a Republican governor to keep a slight check on them for fiscal reasons. Massachusetts has a lot of money, so rich people usually want republicans for governor but not for the national level. But the Republican has to be moderate and socially liberal. Diehl was too crazy for Massachusetts.
