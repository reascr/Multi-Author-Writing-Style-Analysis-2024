The prior poster is not being misleading. The judge overseeing this case asked the Biden Administration to submit a statement on the issue. The Biden Administration therefore submitted a statement on the issue, which set forth (a) its understanding of the law, and (b) that it does not condone the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
I understand why you feel that way, and it's probably at minimum a political error for the very reason that it makes you and others have the reaction you are having. But...I think the reality is that we are a nation of laws and that if we start ignoring the law just because it feels "just" to some observers, we have nothing. At that point, we are a banana republic at the whim of whomever is in charge. So, assuming the State Dept was right on the law (I don't know either way because this is not my area), then I think they were right to respond to the judge's request as they did.
It doesn't quite work that way though, because doing so requires you to ignore the law re immunities. If you have laws that say "x is illegal except that in ABC circumstances, there shall be no liability for x," then it's not ignoring the law to apply to the carveout. That's just following the law.
What kind of law are we upholding though? Sometimes this faux neutral stance itself is a bad one- should the children of monarchs really be given a free pass to have people they dislike chopped up?
