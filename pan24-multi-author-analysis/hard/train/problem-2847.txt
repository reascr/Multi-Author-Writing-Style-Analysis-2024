African countries only exist as they do today because they were drawn up by white men in Europe trying to decide how they were going to divvy up the land to go conquer it.
Yeah, I can't help but think that their definition is intentionally wrong, in order to create a straw man so that mislead people can disagree with queer theory before they can understand what they are or aren't agreeing with.
That just means rethinking queerness outside of the assumptions of American culture and the capitalist system.Densantis is wrong but it's clear to see why DeSantis doesn't like it as the conservative mindset likes to mistake culture for nature and objective reality.
However, when DeSantis talks queer theory, he is using it because the word “queer” invokes an emotional reaction with bigots and the intolerant. The theories was also developed in the 70s, so it resonates with baby boomers still looking to crush some hippy heads. When DeSantis says it, it has nothing to do with the actual theory. He is basically taking volumes and decades of research and turning it into a Sunday cartoon except there’s no punchline. It’s just queer bashing.
Many of those women happen to be queer. These facts should not be dismissed, details and context are very important.
