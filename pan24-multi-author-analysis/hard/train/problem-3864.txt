Which is done through gerrymandering, voter suppression, AND the Dems not really listening to voices in the most impoverished BIPOC communities. Many of the most marginalized in this country often rarely see a change in their lives whether it’s a blue or red administration. I will always advocate for folks to vote and will always do so myself, but for the first time in my adult life I think I can finally grasp and feel empathy for the generational burnout felt by marginalized communities which leads them to feel their votes don’t matter.
This what we should be doing with our spare time in between voting seasons. We should also, in turn, stay loud with those we voted for as advocates for marginalized communities as they are already burnt out on working to survive every day.
I think my advocacy work with marginalized communities is standing by those I vote for on the left. If I can help individuals recognize the importance of voting and do so compassionately and with empathy while also encouraging the good guys to do better, how is that de facto standing by the fascists?
Thats all well and good, but excusing apathy because of it has serious "white people are only voting for fascists because of economic anxiety" energy.
By the way, most marginalized communities do not stand by and not vote because they think white people are only voting fascists. They don’t pay much energy to people who are currently voting but instead look inwardly at their own generational situations and think ‘if things have been the same for us since my grandfather or my great-grandfather’s time, then why should I vote?’.
