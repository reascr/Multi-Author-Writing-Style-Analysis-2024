The danger is blown out of proportion by people who don’t understand the context of the Fukushima disaster, nor Japan’s extremely effective anti-earthquake equipment installed in every building. The earthquake did not cause the disaster. The tsunami that overcame the seawall and flooded the backup generators in the basement did. If TEPCO had heeded warnings from years prior and built the seawall higher, no disaster. If the backup generators were placed above the first floor, no disaster. Every part of the accident was preventable and had nothing to do with the earthquake itself.
Hibakusha is not related to nuclear energy at all, and is strictly restricted to victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki both in usage and in meaning. Victims of Fukushima—which are mostly didplaced people and not bodily harm—are higaisha; a general term for a victim that applies to any and all disasters.
Fukushima killed like 600 people and it took "the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in japan" plus a tsunami, to cause the reactor to fail. That earthquake alone killed 20.000 people.
There was a once in 200 year major earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people. How many people died from the nuclear disaster compared to those who died from dam disasters caused by the earthquake? Should we decommission all the dams in Japan as they are objectively more dangerous?
