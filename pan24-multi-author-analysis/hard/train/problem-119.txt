Russia sucks, but lets not discount the strategic value of Bakhmut. If Ukraine loses it the next defensible geographic position is a mountain ridge 30km away. Good news is that AFU are holding and expanding control of Bakhmut into the suburbs and have almost completely pushed Russia out.
If Girkin's report is to believed basically Bakhmut is being assaulted my Wagner Prison-PMCs that are basically being given iPhones, being told to attack on X-Axis, sent in small infantry groups with no support, and they get shot if they don't do it, deviate from their route or fail. Then they just get shot or blown up by Ukraine as soon as they're spotted.
So, there was a drone attack against Crimea a couple of days ago. I saw several claims of explosions, fires, and active air defense, but no other news ever appeared. But here's a thread translating a Russian report about it.
>QUICK THREAD on the Russian military trying to learn from past attacks to defend Crimea from Ukrainian drone strikes. Main points below on the December 23-24 drone strike with Mugin-5 commercial drones in Ukraine;' service.
- a drone fired two missiles, one was shot down, other hit its target. Drone itself was not shot down.
> "As a result of its [the droneâ€™s] debris falling, three Russian servicemen who were at the airfield were mortally wounded." It is claimed that the aircraft was not damaged after the attack on the airfield.
Just thinking about the airbase strike, I wonder if the target wasn't the planes, wasn't the control tower, but the pilots. Arguably more value in taking out the pilots themselves than what they use. Especially if Russia reporting 3 dead. Thoughts?
