Some Germans economists expressed their warnings that if ECB continues that path they will convince their nation to get back to DM.
The discussion from the previous year led to first cracks in Euro zone and a common currency as ECB has a tough job trying to please countries like Germany and Italy with the same policy.
Then Germany should better dissolve the European Union in the future if it isn't willing to have a common fiscal policy with the rest of the 26 EU member nation-states.
That's not a common fiscal policy you are implying. A common fiscal policy consists of decisions about the collection and expenditure of taxes that have to be taken by a common institution and shared by the participating governments, thus EU must have a common tax-collecting agency like the US IRS for example.
But when it comes to the proposal of bailing out southern European countries during the 2009-12 Euro crisis via fiscal stimulus, it was Germany and other northern European countries who opposed it and these southern European countries still suffer the negative effects of austerity.
