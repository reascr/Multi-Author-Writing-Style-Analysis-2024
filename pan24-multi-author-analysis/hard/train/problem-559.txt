Real news requires real journalists, who it turns out, require a paycheck. Advertisers have mostly left newspapers in favor of social media, so that paycheck has to come from somewhere.
Subscriptions are great (in my opinion, obviously) but you seem to have a problem with paying for news, so it’s you that’s disallowing that one.
It really shows the disconnect between the owners of what is supposed to be helpful journalistic media and the people trying to ... well, ACTUALLY JOURNALIZE. Paywalls are sorely misguided and barely a boundary to anyone who really wants to read something, and the sooner the corporate suits that run those organization realize that, the better.
Depressingly, it turns out that "fake news" is invariably free. The truth is far more likely to require payment, and the ones with the highest journalistic standards (I'm not sure how they qualified that, but they had some kind of criteria) are mostly the ones with the paywall bullshit.
B, I reject the very premise that news should be considered anything but a loss leader, for the most part. That they are trying to generate a PROFIT at the expense of gating important information away from citizens that may already need some convincing even to LOOK at it, while the planet burns and fascism grows ....
