Tell them if they wish a merry instead of a deadly Christmas…, withdrawal back to Russia while handing over the Crimea et al. They withdraw Merry Christmas to them. They don’t Rudolf is the name of every missile when it lands in their laps while they are in Ukraine.
I’m a little worried about the hypersonic missile boat that the Russians have; however, Ukraine has fought valiantly for their home.
When I was debating the war in Ukraine, someone said to me that it’s NATO’s fault because it would be akin to Mexico joining an alliance with Russia and stationing troops there (since it’s so close to the USA).
But the West has to be aware of Russia's history and concerns, and that NATO is a military alliance that has be creeping closer and closer to it door with no "Cuban missile crisis game of chicken" that has happened until now. And it's all fun and games poking a bear when it's asleep. It's complicated, my heart is with the Ukrainians, but consessions have to be made on both sides, and both sides have to want peace. The consessions have to start from Russia as well, the aggressor.
Let's not talk about any of the politics of the cold war or post cold war. Let's just look at this horrible invasion, call Putin an evil terrorist, and keep encouraging these young Ukrainians to keep fighting with our weapons til Russia taps out.
Any Russian that is in Ukraine to fight for the Russians is an enemy combatant and deserves to die. Russians that fled to avoid conscription or any Russian that surrenders to Ukraine at first chance should be reprieved. Ukraine has setup multiple ways for Russian soldiers to surrender.
It is past time to send them ATACMS. We have already sold them to Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE. If we can sell them to those countries we can trust Ukraine with them.
