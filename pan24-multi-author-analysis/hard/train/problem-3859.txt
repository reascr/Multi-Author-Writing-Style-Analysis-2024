I agree freshman congressman have little power or influence, but I wouldn't be surprised if this idiot is around for the next two years. McCarthy is probably excited about the distraction Santos provides.
Correct. Special election and I don't think they are willing to risk it. I also think they like it when someone is saying outlandish shit so they can quietly dismantle democracy and enrich themselves while the public focuses on a meaningless scandal.
Unless I've missed something, I don't think McCarthy has indicated Santos won't be on committees, so he'll get his time, make a spectacle and the media will cover it, because that's what they do.
There is no recall process for Congress. He'll either have to resign under pressure or be expelled or his district will have to vote him out next election cycle.
If he were to resign or be expelled, there would have to be a special election, right? The governor cannot appoint a house member iirc. So theyâ€™re not going to want to surrender the seat, and besides the Republican MO is to be very concerned until it blows over and gets replaced by their next scandal, which should be next week if things hold up the way they have been.
