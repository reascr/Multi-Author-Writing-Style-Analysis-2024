If republicans ban abortion, slash taxes on the rich or take away lgbt rights none of those things hurt Biden, he is a rich white man. He and his family will continue living a luxury life, he does not need to be president .
People act like they are doing Biden a favor by voting for him but in reality you need him far more than he needs you.
Reality check - it's not Biden's job to run the Democratic Party - it's not a dictatorship and in any case the guy is busy presidenting. It doesn't matter whether or not someone else could, in theory do the job, it matters that in reality, no one else is likely to defeat the Republican candidate while Biden will more than likely win if he runs.
No, in reality, Biden will almost certainly win if he runs while the Republican candidate will almost certainly lose if Democrats don't run Biden.
Actually we need a Republican to not win the presidency in 2024, and Biden is the best prospect for beating out the GOP candidate, regardless of your ageism.
If they push Biden for 2024, anybody that half pays attention to politics will vote for the younger candidate (aka DeSantis). DNC needs to put a 50-60yo up.
