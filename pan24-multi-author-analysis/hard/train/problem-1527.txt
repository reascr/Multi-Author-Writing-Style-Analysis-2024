I've never been banned so easy before. Like I grew up conservative so I like to have real discussions as i can understand them even if I disagree with them. I think that's what pisses them off even more is how I can agree and disagree with them rather then purely disagree. I live around the conservative heartland of Canada. What makes me laugh is when they realize I'm not on their side and its like extra painful/infuriating to them. The loss of trust hahaha. Like I'm pro capitalism and that's about where I stop because what's happened I'm the last couple decades is more fascism than capitalism..im against fasicm hugely and all for socialist policies. I'm a capitalist socialist (liberal canadian, also you can be liberal and hate trudeau which cons dont understand) which REALLY pisses off conservatives. That's why I swear cons hate liberals more than NDP or any left wings lol.
They genuinely think the conservative subs are less biased, even though they're as bad as the tankie ones when it comes to banning people for wronhink.
It's always funny when someone pops out of there and is like "This is reddit, if you want a less biased opinion you should head over to r/conservative" -- I mean yeah, we're all biased, but holy shit lol.
