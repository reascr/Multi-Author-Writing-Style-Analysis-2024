Answer appears to be, "Quite a lot." He has signed sweetheart contracts with incompetent suppliers who will then sue if they are not paid to not deliver non-functioning equipment.
40% is the number he claims, but the company he has selected has no experience making EVs or mass-producing vehicles, apparently. It looks like a recipe for delays and cost overruns, and for the delivered vehicles to not work as advertised.

Good. Large fleet vehicles that drive known distances and have lots of stop and go driving is an ideal use for electric vehicles. Curious how much gas that will save per year.
