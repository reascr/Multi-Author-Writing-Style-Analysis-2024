She didn’t actually used to make shit… her dad gave her and her husband his business and then she ‘founded’ a crossfit gym with her trainer which she had to step down from after a few years of unprofitability. She has never actually earned a salary in her life.
It’s exactly like trump. She has never actually accomplished anything in her life. Her father gave her and her husband a contracting business and she ran a a CrossFit gym into the ground. She’s literally done nothing and has never actually earned money. She’s mistaking getting paid a salary for ‘I get more money from my dad when I whine enough’.
If she's so miserable (not actually) doing her job she should leave. Also, she can't complain about her salary when her mere presence in Congress is preventing much needed legislation from being passed to help those who are barely scraping by right now.
It's not our job to fix her problems as she seems to think, it's the other way around. Congress is supposed to be about public service not just serving oneself.
Edit: I think most congress people have other jobs as well? Guess she's trying the influencer employment model with this.
