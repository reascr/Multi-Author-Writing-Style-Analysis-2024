I remember shortly before the 2016 election FiveThirtyEight ran an article that said the election was just a normal polling error away from Trump winning. I think people just didn’t want to believe that he could win so most people assumed the polls showed Hillary winning and that any polling error would surely end up in her favor. It didn’t, but the polls weren’t off by much more than usual in 2016. 2018/2020/2022 were all pretty much in line with that the polls said too.
Trump is an authentic representation of his base, that’s why they love him. He enjoys fast food, his vocabulary is simple, he has terrible taste in style, he says the things they wish a politician would say. No one can replicate that because for all of his faults Trump is genuinely Trump. When he says things he genuinely means it in that moment. While not actually blue collar, Trump’s whole personality is that of someone who is blue collar “telling it like it is” type of personality. He has a weird sort of charisma in that way. It’s partly why the rich reject him, he’s not truly one of them. That’s also why his base loves him, he’s intended as a big F-You to the rich since the rich do hate him. The others are too calculated and frankly, too smart to really be embraced by Trump’s base. Plus DeSantis and Haley have little to no charisma.
FOLLOWER 2: It's Nikki Haley. Her real last name is Nimroda or something like that. She's really an Indian.
Okay, I'm putting that on my short list. Maybe "Nikki Nimroda" to connect the dots better for his followers.
FOLLOWER 1: Can they run for office? I thought reservations were, like separate countries or sumthin'.
