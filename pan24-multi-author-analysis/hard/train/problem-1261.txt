When Willis decides to indict she’ll need to seat a regular grand jury. If you see anything that says she’s got a regular grand jury in place it won’t be long after that.
Shouldn't take long to present to a regular grand jury. The evidence has already been procured and the report by the special grand jury will help expedite the process.
I thought the special grand jury did strictly an investigation, and the regular grand jury took those results and could decide and refer charges, not a lawyer, though, just an observer.
I think the special grand jury sees more evidence than the regular grand jury would see. When they finish their job, a regular grand jury can evaluate a limited set of evidence to determine if charges should be filed so the people making that decision are not biased by having seen evidence that should not have been factored into the decision.
Further, voting on an indictment isn't accusing someone of guilt - it's simply saying that probable cause has been established to bring a trial.
It only takes 12/23 jurors to recommend an indictment (not unanimous like a trial jury and conviction).
