I suspect this is why whenever I read what a journalist has to say about something technical, if I'm reading about a field I'm actually familiar with, I tend to be somewhat less than impressed.
Because this shit is hard. I had to go to school for nine years to become good at what I'm good at. Very few people will do that and then become journalists themselves.
So many podcasters and journalists I used to respect have fallen into giving everyone a voice. Well, spoiler alert, not every idiot deserves an audience or respect, apart from the standard minimum human decency. They don’t get a voice simply because they are yelling loudly. Giving equal time to horrible and damaging ideas is contributing to their proliferation. It’s almost like no one can just hear some horrible idea and shrug, say “That’s stupid.” and move on.
What a stupid take. How can anyone think the media evenly portrays both sides? Actual journalism is almost dead, and we are left with poorly educated editorialists pretending to be journalists. If I saw objective news, I'd probably poo my pants, have a heart attack, and die. You can blame clickbait, media owners, William Randolph Hurst, or whoever you want, but it is obvious that most media is a pathetic grab for attention and mostly void of facts.
