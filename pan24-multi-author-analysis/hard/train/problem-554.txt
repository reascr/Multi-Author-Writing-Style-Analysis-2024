Lol didnâ€™t China only recently announce they are banning the sale of military grade semiconductors to Russia. I cannot help but feel that Russia greatly overestimates their alliance with China let alone Chinas long term intentions. Putin seems to be grasping straws with his economical threats and nuclear rhetoric, and until Russia brings some type of noteworthy victory to the table China can only see Russia as a loser in this war and therefor vulnerable.
He doesn't "hit back" shit, he's just begging China to buy Russia oil, China as usual will take advantage of the situation and it seems like now Putin is short on cash again and want to sell more oil to China so China will ask him to buy it at an even more cheaper price. Russia is doomed, they have already crossed the point of no return, they will crash and burn at an epic level, which will be remembered for centuries to come. Putin know it but he's desperate, and surely doesn't want to let go the power that he now hold, and in the process he will mercilessly drag the whole country in to a political and economic death pit.
