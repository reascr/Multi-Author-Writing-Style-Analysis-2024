There should be a negotiation on the federal budget. The house is directly responsible for creating the spending bill. It's one of their primary jobs.
I think the "no negotiations" was around deciding not to pay outstanding debts. There's no reason for Biden to negotiate on that because the House already passed the bills authorizing the spending.
President Joe Biden will press House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for a detailed list of spending proposals when the two meet at the White House on Wednesday, officials said ahead of the meeting.
Biden advisers Brian Deese and Shalanda Young said in a memo to reporters Tuesday that the White House would release its own budget in early March.
“It is essential that Speaker McCarthy likewise commit to releasing a budget, so that the American people can see how House Republicans plan to reduce the deficit,” Deese and Young wrote.
My favorite part was when McCarthy said he wasn't going to play politics with the debt ceiling, after letting the deadline pass, without having an outlined budget prepared on day 1 of his speakership, despite knowing that his party had the House and that he was most likely going to become speaker.
I think the equivalent is a college final, but the professor informs you _what_ the final project is going to be on the first day of class, and tells you that you can work on it during the whole semester, but for whatever reason you wait until the night before the project is due, then whine that you couldn't turn it in. Somehow, instead of failing you, the school decides to hold up every other class on campus, requiring all students, staff, and faculty to attend-- and to cover the upkeep, the school starts selling its land.
