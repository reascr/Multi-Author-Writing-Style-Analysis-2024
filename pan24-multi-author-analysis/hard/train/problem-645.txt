Neoliberal democrats hate Bernie because he points out all of the failings of their ideology and isn't shy about it. Thus, the media that aligns with them loves to post hit articles and denigrate his name to dunk on those who favor more progressive legislation.
And a lot of it has been based upon policies that are more left than I saw when Obama was president, and this is coming from a Blue Dog Democrat (Biden) at that.
>(Some would also argue that if Clinton had campaigned more in the so-called "blue wall" states, she also could have picked up more votes.).
Well because it is. If you look at the tumult from the Left, and the Right over the course of years, be it Tea Parties, Occupation Wall St, BLM and Far Right Insurrectionists, we are in the throes of a Revolution whether we want to admit or not.
Here at rpolitics, it seems the Neo Cons, and what's left of them, are Democrats, not Republicans, and in that, a generation who has at most another decade of political viability.
sounds like the democrats should probably move left, and maybe try posing any form of obstacle to fascism for once, if they want to run on "vote for us, we can save democracy".
i'm not gullible enough to pretend the democrats would even slow down fascism (which they can't) if they wanted to (which they don't).
If you think that the Democratic party hasn't been moving left, you haven't been paying attention. The amount of legislation passed for one is staggering for a president in this age, the most effective Congress since the 1960's, in arguably the most polarized political climate we've ever seen.
