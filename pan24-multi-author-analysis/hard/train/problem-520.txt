North Korea itself is a joke, while China and Russia are seen as (or at least were) superpowers who are unlikely to be phased by international pressure. It’s also not really a secret that they are oppressive dictatorships nor do they make a serious attempt at hiding it, while Israel continues to be viewed in a more positive light and markets itself as “the only democracy in the Middle East”.
A lot of people in Israel (if not most) that support the military presense in the WB do so solely because of security reasons - it has very strategic positions that the Jordanians used to attack Israel from, and later were used as bases for terror operations inside Israel.
There is wide political support for Hamas in the WB, and if Israel leaves - the rockets from the west back could cover the whole country easily. They don't want to take any more chances after leaving Gaza.
Palestinian have a hard time under Israel's occupation but they also have it bad under Hamas' Gaza. Some of the resolutions are submitted by Hamas itself which is ironic and despicable,and many including the latest one denouncing Israel are submitted by the PA while they themselves are guilty of corruption and oppressing any political opposition and critics.
Some of the tallied “anti-Israel” resolutions are literally resolutions to help Palestinians. They are not condemnations of Israel, they are trying to help Palestine.
Israel also has more enemies. Most of the non-Western world are allies with or indifferent towards China and Russia.
