Seriously. The chucklefucks in r/conservative are all like "i wonder what the "Dems" have to say about this one". We think mishandling of classified information should be investigated? Are they admitting it's a crime now? The left's stance on investigations into this kind of thing hasn't changed between biden and trump.
Mishandling of classified documents. It's a really easy charge to stick someone who frequently deals with massive amounts of classified information. just wait until they inevitably fuck it up, then accuse. If Cheeto Dust had just complied with orders to return the documents he took over and over again, he wouldn't have gotten raided. The damn FBI director was appointed by him, and still knew those docs god to be gotten back.
I used to work with classified document security. Believe it or not, breaches happen more frequently than you'd like to think. Usually, they don't amount to anything, and initial offenders usually just get reprimanded. Repeat offenders, or offenders that don't cooperate with security, will be charged and held accountable according to the level of classification of materials left unsecured. This includes revocation of security clearance, heavy fines, and prison sentences.
A range of consequences from a talking to, to losing security clearance, to minor charges, to very serious charges.
