Hard to be sympathetic here, Iâ€™ve always felt the Republican Party as a necessity to keep hard left democrats in check , but they flirted harder and harder with racism until it backfired and trump took advantage.
I really hope the majority of Americans see right through these feeble attempts from some within the Republican party to distance themselves from Trump. They should never be allowed to forget or move on from the fact that they jumped right onto the Trump train and fired up the engines to full throttle. They were never forced to anchor their entire identity to Trump, but willing chose to. Trump is who they all are and always will be.
However Trump is showing his true colors and needs to go. Romney likewise should be run out of office.
I have news for Mitt Romney. Trump and in the future someone just like him IS the Republican party. He has been ever since Kevin McCarthy, Lindsay Graham and Mitch McConnell decided to kiss Trump's ass instead of stand up to him on principal. Better to lose what is left of our democracy than for them to lose any of their millions of dollars or risk their political careers.
