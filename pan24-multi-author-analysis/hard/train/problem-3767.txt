Yeah, American paid sick leave is 1 to 2 weeks usually, and for me at least, is also my vacation time. It's all indistinguishable under the umbrella term "paid time off". Probably why so many people come to work sick - don't want to screw up the family vacation time.
They want time off, not just sick time, but time like weekends. The shitty rail companies have those workers coming in nonstop. Some people don't even get a day off until weeks later.
I thought the railroad workers wanted guaranteed unpaid leave, I like the idea of 7 to 14 sick days, but they wanted to be able to have weekends and not be called into work for another shift.
If they really wanted to help the workers they would have made the sick days on the same bill, or would have let the strike runs it’s natural course.
If it is that big of a deal then they should just pass it with the 7 sick days. Surely a small hit in profits isn’t worth crippling the nation.
Ok, take it back 70+ years. What working rights have we gotten? In what ways has the material conditions improved for the working class since FDR? We have no guaranteed health care, sick days, vacation days, maternity leave, minimum wage has been outpaced by the cost of living, housing is out of control, education costs are out of control, what exactly has gotten better for working class citizens? We get cheap iPhones and tvs, gee my cup runneth over. We are the richest nation in the e world and we don’t have basic working rights the rest of the developed world has.
Material conditions are getting worse because both parties don’t give one flying fuck about you. In fact, they get richer at making your lives more miserable.
