I know Redditors love to bang on about Nazi gold or whatever, but having a country run by a council with revolving presidency, an economy that hasn't collapsed multiple times in modern history, and a population where the best and brightest haven't been fed into a meat grinder every 30 years or so, but still have to do compulsory national service has led to a society that is functional to the point of being almost unrecognizable to people from other countries.
Insulin in my world is only a couple of bucks, and if you wind up spending a bunch on meds overall in a given year, then fuck it - have the rest for free.
And in Norway (at least) anything diabetes related is free of charge. Because healthy diabetics are much cheaper.
Generic human insulin as a drug is available super cheaply at a lot of retailers. The expensive ones are the newer faster-acting variants of artificial insulin, which just use newer techniques to make them slightly more convenient.
The article even says that there's no reason to think these newer artificial insulin products are more beneficial than human insulin. Why is all of this such an issue when regular insulin is available cheaply already?
Also, as more people are shifted away from the top-of-the-line insulin, those products should get cheaper as there is less demand of it.
