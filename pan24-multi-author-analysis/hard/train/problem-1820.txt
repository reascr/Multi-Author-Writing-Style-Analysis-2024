Between 1936-1938, when the Soviet Union was not at war, Stalin had about a million of his citizens executed, including almost all of his top military leaders.
Russian dictators are very good at killing their own people, and their people are very experienced at watching it happen to them.
I can see Putin taking to live TV right now telling his people Ukraine is killing all their children for defending Russia.
Sadly, I think Ukraine is going to need to kill 1000 Russian soldiers daily for a few years in order to win. Young Russians have proven to care very little about their own lives, and the Russian population is large. This is why we must keep sending equipment to Ukraine. I'm very optimistic Ukraine will soon be able to average that number.
And generally speaking, Russian leaders have no idea how to succeed in the 21st century. They mentally live in a world that no longer exists, and their strategies show it.
I agree that it'd be a complicated equation of pros and cons. If the death rates were anything like those of Russian troops in the Ukraine-Russia war, I'd take my chances on a life somewhere else. Or do the jail time. Better that than dead.
Before watching x number of street interviews with random Russians, I would have agreed with you, but surprisingly many of them fundamentally say that they don't particularly want to go, but if they are conscripted then whatever, they'll go, because what else can they do. So there's a very widespread fatalistic attitude.
