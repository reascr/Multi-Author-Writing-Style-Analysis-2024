A significant portion of their base does not support gay marriage, and that means losing a primary vote when they come up for re-election. It absolutely costs them, or you'd see a lot more votes for it.
Yes I was so surprised a bunch of republicans also voted for it in the House Now we get to see which republican senators have the guts to vote for it when it comes to the floor.
Nearly 20% of people think it's very bad for society, I'll take any odds you have that they're nearly all republican. That's a huge, well motivated portion of their base that will be against any republican who votes for it.
And both Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh have said that any Republican Senator who chose to vote yes on this bill should be kicked out of the party. That there should be some sort of a litmus test for the GOP. Good luck trying to win elections with 30% support of such a position on an issue as gay marriage.
30% and shrinking, every year there's going to be fewer and fewer hardliners against gay marriage. They'll never entirely go away, we still got people weird about interracial marriage, but the trend is towards acceptance.
