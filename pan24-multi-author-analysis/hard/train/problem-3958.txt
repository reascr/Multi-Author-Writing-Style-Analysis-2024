I tend to think of Trump as the bookend for the Nixon era of the Republican party. Nixon won with his "Southern Strategy" and we've been experiencing the dimishing returns on that ever since. Hopefully, Trump was the final death rattle of an era in Republican politics.
So youre looking at a solid 2 to 4 decades of decline for the Republican party. Calling out extremist cells in 2016 wouldve been like water on a hot stove.
In theory, no. In actuality i think the political system in the US is too corrupted and rigid for a 3rd party, because said 3rd party would essentially act as a vote splitting party to either ensure a perennial democratic or republican leadership.
The Rs need to be rebuilt from the ground up, if they want to distance themselves from the far right. However the people in charge are at least friendly towards the far eight. Furthermore, they need the right wing votes because they wont get any support from the left. So its almost a catch-22 where they cant fully distance themselves from the far right without destroying their electoral chances.
