Denying athletes from entering will be unfair to the athletes and will have little to no effects on the IOC decisions at all.
Allowing athletes that cheat to continue to compete and deny those fairly competing to be denied the fair competition is far more unfair.
How this could be considered a fair competition if Ukrainian athletes being killed, Ukrainian sport facilities being destroyed, and russians will come try to get prizes unaffected?
Overall I just think it would be grossly unfair to apply the same penalty to Russians and Belarussians, I think Belarussians should be made compete as neutrals but Russia should be banned completely. And of course it should be made sure that Russians don't switch countries lol.
From my experience Belarusians however are not in support of their government actions. I live close by in Poland - I've met many Belarusians with families back at home and none of them had nice words for their regime. They all said the votes are fake. Do you remember the protests in Belarus before the war? A fuckton of people are angry with their government and they show it. Unfortunately they have just been unsuccessful so far. The migrant crisis was created to distance Belarus from Poland and other surroubding countries and it has been successful.
I disagree. Belarusians have a very sad storyand they are definitely not 'fine' being assimilated BY FORCE into Russia. They are kept under a shoe by Russia who exerts a ton of influence over their government and the thing is you would need an actual weaponised uprising in Belarus to change anything, but ultimately that would get rid of one dictator and another one paid off by Russia would soon replace him.
