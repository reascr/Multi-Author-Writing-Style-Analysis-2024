Besides, it’s Superman 1, the Constitution, a photo of his parents whom he lost to COVID, and his citizenship certificate.
He's actually swearing in on the Constitution, underneath that will be a photo of his parents, his citizenship documents, and the Superman 1. So he's swearing in on the Constitution plus a few things that have personal meaning to him. But the media is running with the headline that it is just the comic book, because clickbait.
That's what Garcia is doing. He's swearing on the Constitution, underneath that will be a photo of his parents (both died to Covid), his citizenship certificate, and the Superman 1. So a good mix of the meaning of his job and the things he personally puts value in.
