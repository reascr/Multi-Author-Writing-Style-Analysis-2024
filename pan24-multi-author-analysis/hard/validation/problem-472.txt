Everything? That's hardly the case. There's also evidence that suggest it's a KH-101. Let's just wait for an investigation instead of parroting conjecture we find on twitter.
Well today we have seen US officials claim it was a Russian missile, fired from Russia, then we saw them claim it wasn't fired by Russia but still a Russian missile, then we saw that maybe it was a missile fired from Belarus, then possibly an S300.
out of their ass, since the general consensus now is it was a Ukrainian 5V55 missile from a S-300 that went off course when trying to intercept a Russian missile and landed in Poland.
I \think\ we are talking about the possibility of Russian missiles fired by the Russian military stationed in Belarus hitting Poland. This doesn't necessarily change anything, but it does add an extra layer of complexity.
If you look at a map, Belarus stands out like a sore thumb as an obvious possibility. Poland says it was definitely Russian-made, and Russia has previously fired similar missiles dangerously close to Poland from staging areas in Belarus.
He (hopefully) means as in not fired directly from Russia itself, but more likely from missile batteries from within Ukraine or possibly Belarus. Notice i said "hopefully".....
