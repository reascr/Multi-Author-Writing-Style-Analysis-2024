Every time I see this anti-voter stance it disgusts me. If your entire "victory" stems on suppressing 70% of the voters for a party then it's not a victory.
Which really brings us to 2028. We have a pretty big gap in acceptable candidates. Call me jaded but I really just want the most disarming boring seeming candidate that can do excellent work while letting the congress hold the focus, as they're supposed to.
Sure some of them could try challenging for it now, and squander all of their resources against an already established president serving only to weaken Biden for the general election. Or they could save those resources and collect money and favors around the country by showing that they can get a coalition of Democrats elected to state and national offices outside of their home state.
I want him to be the nominee right now because we don't have a good field of candidates to run in the primary. There are a handful who might be ready in a few years, but none that would be ready by 2024.
We do not have to wait for 2024. There will be local and state elections in 2023. Start voting out as many republicans as we can now. Vote every chance you get from the school board to the white house every seat we take is one step closer to saving democracy and making progress.
If people start voting in numbers in these off year elections for democrats it would make it more likely people we could vote for would run. Democracy is not one and done.
