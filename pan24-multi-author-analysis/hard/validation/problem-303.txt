It’s when Israel annexes parts of the West Bank where Palestinians used to live and then bans the Palestinians from going there any more. It’s a slow land-grab/ethnic cleansing.
Just because there weren’t houses in a particular spot doesn’t mean it was useless to the Palestinians. Vast swathes of the US are uninhabited, does that mean some other country could come and annex them, then forbid Americans from going there any more?
You’re disgusting. How do you defend Palestinians living in an area and then being driven off of it and not allowed to return? This has nothing to do with individual renters or individual buildings. Israel takes the land and then only allows Israelis to live there from then on.
A settlement is any Israeli city, town, or any other place where Israelis live outside of "the green line".
Here is an example of one settlement: Jewish neighbourhoods of Hebron. Jews lived in Hebron for over 3000 years. After massacres of Palestinian Jews by Palestinian Arabs in 1920 and 1929, most Jews fled Hebron. Last Jew left Hebron in face on invading Jordan forces in 1948. Once Jordan was kicked out in 1967, Jews started returning to the buildings that they never sold and remained in Jewish ownership all along. Neighbourhoods of such Jews in Hebron are called settlements.
Also discussing of forcing ethnicities out, what happened to Bethlehem and Hebron which had large Jewish population? It's like Arabs just decided to start murdering Jews and forcing them to move. And now Jews in any of those areas will get murdered or stoned. Not to mention the Arab side of Jerusalem.
Keep in mind Arabs weren't called Palestians at any point of history. For this reason between wars independence war and the 6 days, most propaganda slogans used by Arab nations attacking Israel were "Destroy Palestine, kill Zionism" . Only after 1960's were current Arabs called Palestians. They (Palestians) won't even call the Arabs living in Israel Palestians, rather by their tribes (Druze, Beduim, Egyptian, Syrian and Marrocan). Despite some being on the land as long as the group you call Palestians if not longer.
