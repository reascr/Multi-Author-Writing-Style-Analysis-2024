It's hilarious when they call her just a dumb bartender. Like.. she graduated cum laude from Boston University with a double major in economics and international relations. But sure, go off. Totally dumb.
They hate her bc she's a strong, beautiful, capable woman and they would absolutely do her but she would never touch them 🤣.
Well yeah it definitely doesn’t help them that she’s a 10 while the best they can do is a skanky escort and goonfaced KKKrossfit.
AOC’s representation in the right wing media however is a sexist, racist distortion of someone who is actually competent. They’re afraid of her because of that competency. She’s progressive and popular and there isn’t one Republican in the House who can stand against her rhetorically. And I’m not talking about the average Fox News viewer. I’m talking about the establishment. They know she’s a threat to them so they have to smear her.
All this “they’re afraid of her” nonsense is just tough talk. If she had appeal to centrists, she would have appeal to centrists.
