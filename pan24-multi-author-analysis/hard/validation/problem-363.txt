None of the media outlets that are calling races are presenting what the second and third choice votes are. This is probably because they haven’t figured out how to poll for it, since ranked choice voting is so rare in the U.S.
I found data on the turnout for the primaries and it was only 32% then, but I don’t know if that is the November turnout, too.
The CA gov site says turnout was 32.7% as of Nov 12, but I don’t know if that number is limited to processed ballots only or if it includes received but not processed ballots.
In a lot of states that have mail-in voting, you just have to mail the ballot back by election day, so there's a week or so where ballots are still coming in and are valid and should be counted. Some of these races are close enough that it actually matters this time, where in the past gaps were large enough that the number of outstanding ballots couldn't make up the difference and the race could be called.
They really have to figure out how to get response rates back up. Whether that's via online polling, using numbers that actually resolve on caller ID to trusted names like Gallup, paying people for responses... the status quo just isn't working anymore.
Polling is also having some major issues right now with historically low response rates. Statisticians know that the people who do respond are not like the rest of the population, but it's hard to quantify just how they're different given the low response rate.
