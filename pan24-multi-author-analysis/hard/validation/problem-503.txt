Not to mention the effects of methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are indistinguishable in therapeutic doses. They're the same drug by any meaningful measure.
Anyway the point is drugs are inflation proof (at least at scale). And most nothing else is. For ex. a Big Mac cost $2.36 in in 1996, it’s now $5.93.
It didn’t though… Cocaine has stable inflation proof pricing. The cost of a gram has not increased since 1996. True story. The economics of narco pricing is actually fairly interesting stuff, and all relatively stable. A gram of coke was $60 in the mid 90s in most of the US. It is still the same price. Marijuana $40 an eighth in 1998 (about the same today dependent on quality and state- but almost no inflation). Heroin same story a $10 bag still has 3 shots in it 25 yrs later (though it may be fentanyl instead now).
Typically, a $10 bag of “heroin” is meant to be one “dose” but people with a tolerance are usually doing multiples at a time. I was doing 5-6 in a single shot at one point and that’s nowhere near what some people do.
Are you saying a $10 bag of heroin has three doses in it? If so, that’s inaccurate. It’s also very much based on that persons tolerance, so what’s does a dose really even mean, ya know?
While I find your point interesting, we have to consider quality/purity too. Cannabis? Quality has increased dramatically. Cocaine? Probably far more cut then when it first made its rounds decades ago.
