John Boehner had a 30+ seat majority with a more moderate caucus and he got run out of town by the freedom caucus. He was also a better politician than McCarthy. This will be interesting.
Interesting to hear you say that. I was wondering why it was Scalise announcing the GQP legislative agenda a few days ago. Made McCarthy look weak before he started.
McCarthy pathetic groveling shows how weak that guy would be a speaker. He has already given concessions to the MAGA caucus for their votes.
McCarthy is already caving to the Freedum Cacus for their vote. Even if he gets speaker you know that caucus will make him grovel to him before any house decision. Kevin will go along with their crazy in order ti get their votes, their crazy will get worse and that will cause even more intense party infighting.
It is about to be a wild two tear ride in the house and I do not see McCarthy making it two years as speaker.
Even if he gets speaker, it is going to be wild to see him having to get permission for Taylor Greene for any vote decision and the cluster fuck of infighting that will cause over the next two years.
