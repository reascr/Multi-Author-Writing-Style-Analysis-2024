Canadian here, an auditor here who happened to be mormon went public with the fact that the tithe he and all his church members are paying in canada was going straight to the mormon colleges in the US. Nothing was staying in the local community. Churches are a scam and need to pay taxes.
Tax fraud on this religion? Nahhhh. They don’t pay taxes on anything. I think they really are just being compliant with the tax laws and how they work for a recognized religion.
I think to avoid any favoritism, the IRS should agree to audit the books of the Top 100 religious institutions (based on assets) in the USA. From LDS to Catholic Church to Scientology. No favoritism.
This is very well reasoned and correct. I think the outrage has to do with the intersection of the spirit of the law and the desire that tithing be used to help as many as possible today.
Hahaha It’s okay to rant but as far as educated people within a religious structure you can guess the number of Jews, Catholics (the majority of the Supreme Court is Catholic), Episcopalians and Presbyterians that all have highly educated elite attorneys and accountants among their ranks.
