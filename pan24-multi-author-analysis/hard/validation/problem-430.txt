Sure, but while there are like 10-15% of the nation's judges who are authoritarian wingnuts whose only consistent rule is "my side should win", the other 85-90% of judges and lawyers still operate on the letter of the law and precedent.
The only question is whether the regular legal professionals of the world will actually consider anything a reactionary judge decides as actual precedent, or just sigh pretend it never happened. For their sanity, I reckon they'll keep doing the second one.
I'll just sue him for serving crappy omelets at the omelet bar at Mar a Lago. I've never been there, but I'm sure _someone_ has gotten food poisoning ... I heard about it from a guy who got it from a website. So it has to be true.
Yes there is. It's government assistance not a public good no matter how much you try to equate the two. Which means the public wants means testing applied to it instead of just giving it universally to all borrowers. Forgiveness with no income limit or debt caps was unpopular and not the political win for Dems you assume it would be.
At the same time Republicans are suing because loans are being partially forgiven AND that the forgiveness isn't a high enough dollar amount. Fucking hell.
