I was lucky during the big shutdown in 2013, because I worked as a contractor in a DoD facility that was deemed essential, and my contract had enough funding already allocated that they could continue to pay us for the time being, since it was disbursed in 3 month increments or something like that. Had we been close to the end of that period when the shutdown happened, or had it gone on past that date, I'd have been in just as bad of a bucket as all of my military and government civilian coworkers, who had to show up for work and weren't getting paid, while still having bills to pay.
There's one Democratic State Senator who proclaims himself "strongly pro life" so with 21-19, the Republicans could've had the Lt Gov break a tie, potentially, if they got him to sign on.
Just curious: the article implies that even had this gone the other way, Democrats would still have a 21-19 majority in the state Senate. Does this mean there are Democrats who are anticipated to vote in favor of an abortion ban? That honestly seems like a pretty tone-deaf move in a moderate state right now...
