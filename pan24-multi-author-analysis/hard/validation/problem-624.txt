You're not wrong, the anti labor laws and regulations that bought and paid for politicians have put in place over the last 30 or so years have decimated labor and worker rights while keeping the wages low enough that there isn't even hope of fighting back.
Blaming unions for not being appealing enough instead of the oligarchs who’ve devoted unlimited dark money to politicians to bust unions is kinda gross.
If a large union only facilitated collective bargaining, they’ll find themselves chipped away by the legislature, since the company they’re bargaining against has no such qualms paying off the state.
Dems literally should've passed 1 bill being forcing the corporation to accept the unions reasonable demands.
The second Republicans made it apparent they wouldn't support basically anything but the absolute bare minimum? They should've simply used republican talking points against them "this isnt an appropriate use of government power, especially to pass along a partisan line. it's between the union and corporation" or something along those lines.
