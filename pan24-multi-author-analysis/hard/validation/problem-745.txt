I'm going to be a "snowflake bitch" and put in one more edit just to spite superdad.... This happens, people forget their kids. Successful people. rich people. Poor people. Super organized business people. Doctors, Dentists, Post workers. We are not perfect robots, no matter how much we wish that to be the case. Article reference :
Sounds like they were trying to get to the gate to get the plane to hold, I dont think they were trying to leave their baby behind. Edit : because if they were, there are much better places to do so, like... not with people who know exactly who you are and can stop you from leaving the premises. Jfc people.
That would be a lot worse for the kid than being left with honestly highly trusted members of society in an extremely public and secure and videotaped location... at the very least, could warrant panic. Again, the authorities didn't charge anyone or anything, and plenty of times things like this happen it gets referred to the home nations child services etc... just a fuckup.
Maybe a tiny sliver of malicious compliance combined with not fully understanding policies. They thought free baby, but the seat held things up, during confusion with no ability to get ticket just run to try to stop the plane?
Yeah last i traveled with toddlers, awhile back, some airlines were leaning towards ticketing them for the near future for safety reasons. That's why I wasn't sure plus was in a hurry and didn't read üòÅThanks.
