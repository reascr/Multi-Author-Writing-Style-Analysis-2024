The non aligned movement is dead with the USSR. India is aligned with the US against China. Russia is largely politically and economically irrelevant, the Indian military is just dependent on their defense industries.
Sure, the ideology of the NAM might still be influencing decisions. But the actual purposes and reasons for that ideology have been dead for decades. There is no negotiating power India has, there is no geopolitical negative impact to picking sides anymore - there is simply a country too tied into the Russian military-industrial complex to condemn an illegal invasion.
The real reason is India is dependent on Russia arms and maintenance but this dependency is slowly reducing as India is making its own indigenous and collaborating with countries like France. India hasn't sent anything to Russia but has sent aid to Ukraine.
Yeah I know but Russia is still necessary for Indian defence forces. Joint military exercises don't mean much India has done military exercises with China as well.
When India and USA did military exercises near Chinese borders in India. China objected and followed by an attempted capture of an Indian hill. Also China doesn't like QUAD alliance getting stronger.
China definitely doesn't consider India as a swing state more of soft threat because of QUAD presence.
