20%-25% is where you start possible change in social convention. That is to say, it's enough to get the majority to move to "we're ok with this.".
This. Any time the harm to my children and their future because of how my dad votes gets brought up, he either doubles down or changes the subject entirely. Its frustrating as hell.
That's the most frustrating part. Dems keep just sitting on their hands, trying to pretend like the entire republican party isn't at least corrupt while they chip away at the actual Fondation of democracy.
Not Florida on the other hand is very diverse, but people have been convinced by grifters and liars that voting for democrats doesn't matter.
Idaho is 92% white. While Montana is 88% white. They don't need to do anybring about diversity in their state, because there is pretty much no one but white people' living there. And I bet the population of LBGTQ is very low as well.
If voting didn't matter, republicans wouldn't try so hard to make it difficult for minorities and young people to vote.
