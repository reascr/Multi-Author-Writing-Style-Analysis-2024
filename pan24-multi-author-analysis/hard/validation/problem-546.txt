Indian needs to absolutely police it's drug industry better. If it gets a reputation for poor quality it will go the way of Chinese baby formula companies.
At the end of the day it will only take a few more of these cases and India can forget ever exporting drugs to the west.
In short, medicines meant for exports are untested by Indian drugs controller. It's the responsibility of the country importing it to test and allow it.
And similarly US needs to better enforce it's drug controls. Do remember that when Pfizer was told to validate their vaccine before usage in India, they pulled out. As much as I want export controls in India to be improved, the US and any other country for that matter has to put in quality checks to ensure that they are not importing garbage especially when it comes to medicines and other important goods.
In this specific case, the onus of enforcement was on FDA in US as the company in question only had an export license and did not produce in the Indian market, leading to it not being checked by Indian authorities (medical ones especially).
> â€œThis is being done to bring ease in the drug regulatory practices in India relating to export of drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. All the stakeholders are however required to comply with the regulatory requirements of the importing countries as per their specific needs," the DCGI notice added.
