Jesus taught to be kind and generous to the foreigner and the stranger. Republicans are harshly anti-migrant.
The Church has two millennia of history providing education, medical services, and poverty alleviation. It has only been in the last century or so that state provided education services have overtaken religious ones. And that's without considering the efforts of religious figures pushing the state to do more.
The religious climate tends to act as a push factor rather than as a pull factor here. Elmore City was the inspiration of Footloose, and now Republicans seem dedicated to making the whole state be like Elmore City.
Fair point. However, I argue that everyone should know the eras of history, to understand different laws related to their job, as well as things that will benefit their metacognition (higher thinking). I personally think education should be free on all levels, free college as well. Everyone should be allowed the right to further themselves educationally. There are benefits to learning various subjects, such as learning music improves various parts of the brain. I don't devalue the trades at all. We definitely need trade schools. However, I personally think that there are benefits to learning across the board. I personally don't see education as something that should ever "stop".
