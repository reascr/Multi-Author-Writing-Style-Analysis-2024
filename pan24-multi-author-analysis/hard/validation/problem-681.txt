Not to be a cynical bastard, but Trump threatening to split the R vote by running again might actually get the GOP to come around to the idea of throwing his ass in jail.
I dunno, if Trump goes to jail it's going to be because the GOP stopped protecting him, and he's going to point to that and tell his voters not to vote for Republicans anymore.
For sure, we all want him to be indicted too, but the way things are right now, Trump would be poison to Republicans 2024 chances. Pragmatically, a 2024 primary with Trump and DeSantis is more likely to end up with a Dem win than DeSantis running mostly unopposed.
DeSantis is considered trumps only potential gop rival, but he still only has like 20% of Republicans on board, vs trumps 70+%.
Why on earth would you imagine he wouldn't win the gop primary? They're pretending to be mad at trump for their flop of a midterm, but by the end of the week they'll be back.
Thank you. I'm tired of the bs narrative that trump only decided to run because Obama roasted him to ashes at the press dinner. Trump had run before, and had been talking publicly about wanting to run since the 80s.
