Dozens on just ONE route There are over 233,000 routes in the US. If this is how the post office does things- and it must be because here's the proof right in the side of the road- that means over 5 million ballots At least!
Yeah. "Dozens" in a mail bag mixed with everything else. However this went missing, the ballots likely have nothing to do with the motive and are incidental.
The Santa Clara ballots are the only example I could find of “filled out” ballots being dumped. That seems more serious to me, since those votes weren’t counted.
I found three news reports of postal carriers dumping ballots (and other mail) in the past few years. New Jersey, Boston, and Kentucky. In all 3 cases, the ballots had not yet been filled out. The person requesting the ballot wouldn’t receive it, and would hopefully go vote in person.
Those voters would’ve had a chance to check their absentee ballot status & vote a provisional in-person ballot if they saw the absentee one never showed up. They probably didn’t look.
So they need to be delivered by tomorrow & then decide if they’re still valid. People still should’ve checked status.
Going to court to add a couple dozen “found” ballots a week later, even if they’re all legit, is unlikely.
