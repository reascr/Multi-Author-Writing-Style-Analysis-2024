The truth is you can say anything you want, but they also don't want any responsibility for the consequences of their speech. Any response to their speech is considered not free speech.
There’s a difference between the principle of free speech and the first amendment. The latter is for what you described, but the former is the broader belief that we should have a society that fosters free and open discussion of ideas. Most of the values we hold today started out as unpopular minority opinions, and I think we lose something as a society if we move in the direction of those opinions being suppressed. I say this with absolute certainty that nothing MTG has to say will contribute to society in any way whatsoever. I just think it’s important to remember that freedom of speech as an ideal is broader than the first amendment.
It is amazing that people like MGT do not understand the 1st amendment and that speech has consequences when directed into the public sphere.
So many people, including those that are somehow elected officials, do not understand the 1st Amendment. Twitter is not Congress or a government body.
Lets not use Twitter. Also, delete your info from it. Using that platform is giving him power and money, which he could use to get more of both.
