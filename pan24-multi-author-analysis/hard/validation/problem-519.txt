Also, does her candidacy make liberals’ heads explode? I don’t think it does. I’ll never vote for her or any Republican, but she’s unlikely to get past the primaries.
Not only isn't my head exploding, while I'd never vote for her, Haley is arguably one of the less batcrap insane members of the party. If a Republican had to win she'd be among the less-bad choices (very, very faint praise, but still).
She's playing up the fact that having the first female President with an R next to her name would be a big win.
She's going to have a tough time with Ya'llqaeda getting over her "responsibility" (it wasn't directly her) for taking the confederate rag off the SC Statehouse grounds. So she can't drift too far if any off the Trump script.
She's trying to avoid a showdown with Trump like the plague. The second she crosses Trump's path, he's going to focus his entire hate machine on her and Trump and his base will absolutely mop the floor with her. She knows this, which is why she's going to avoid anything that even mildly catches Trump's attention for as long as possible.
