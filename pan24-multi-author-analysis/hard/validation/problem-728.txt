Help them with their energy goals? I suggest you look into why that whole "death to the West" thing happened. The US and the UK shat the bed here. Pretty decent allies don't put a puppet in power to avoid a country nationalizing their oil.
It should give you a deeper understanding of the real history behind Iran's hatred of the US. Granted, that hate has been exploited and magnified by religious authorities to keep a tight grip on the country but it's founded on a very legitimate grievance.
In light of this, calling the US a decent ally of Iran in the past and attributing them any good intentions in their relationship is... a bit farfetched.
The funny (worst) part is, America had improving relations with Iran until Trump pulled us out of the nuclear deal. If that deal was still going, Russia wouldn't have any room to fill our role.
Russia isnt going to help them with jackshit. That allows Iran to leverage both sides because they know they are never under threat of being attacked.
Well if ruSSia proposed Iran niclear bomb than this would explain Iran willingness to send military help. Not sure if ruSSia can help to develop but they definitely can share.
