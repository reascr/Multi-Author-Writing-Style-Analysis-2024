I dunno, trump has a habit of admitting to actual crimes so at this point I think there absolutely needs to be an investigation into this because of the possibility that it’s an actual crime he’s casually dropping because he’s throwing a tantrum.
While that question is unsettled, we are 100% guaranteed that Trump will call any investigation that attempts to answer the question a "witch hunt", and that he has been "unfairly treated", "maybe the most unfairly treated person ever.".
2018 - "That's such a funny ad. What a great sense of humor, DeSantis has." Then DeSantis used Trump as a model, including gaining weight, imitating his manners, making empty promises, getting a Nazi Barbie press secretary (who was an unregistered foreign agent), pushing xenophobia and COVID misinformation, threatening those who disagreed with him and abusing his power to punish them.
It was the same thing as in 2016, "lol, Trump is comedy gold. What a great sense of humor this guy has.".
Yep. We had a conversation one night. He was kinda stunned into silence and just shook his head when he realized who Trump really was.
They're out there. My father in law is one of them. He cannot vocalize that he was wrong but he is so disappointed in himself. He will still vote Republican tho. He really had no idea Trump was a bad person because he exclusively watched FOX.
