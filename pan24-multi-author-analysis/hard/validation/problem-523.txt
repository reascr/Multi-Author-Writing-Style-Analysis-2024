Jesus thats bleak. And I would say that if we are only talking about the sheer loss, it doesn't matter. But if we're talking about how to address the issue, it is important to know how the gunshot wounds break down.
If it's mostly homicide, I would say that requires a different approach to fixing the issue than if it was even a 50/50 split between suicide and homicide. As horrible and depressing as that statistic is, just "gunshot deaths" as a data point doesn't do much in addressing what we need law makers to do to solve this issue.
Where did you find that statistic? I'm genuinely curious. Also is that just gunshot wounds or do they break it down into categories like suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury?
Do you have figures for the breakdown is for homicide vs suicide vs accidents in gun deaths of children?
I stand corrected. It looks like it is a recent development in the US. It does leave off 6 years of the original age bracket. I'm not sure if that makes a difference in the rankings , but it certainly doesn't change the scale of the problem in the US.
