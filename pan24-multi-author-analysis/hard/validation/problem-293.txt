Guess why? Because of a strong defense alliance, the exact alliance republicans are now trying to dissolve. Had trump won Ukraine would be under Russian control, Moldova would be next and we’d actually have Russia steamrolling it’s way into europe. Republicans have a gift, destroying perfectly fine working American institutions, I wonder why that is? Who puts them up to it and how many rubles do they get (per fuckup).
"The fear of Russia going into NATO countries and all that and steamrolling, you know, that has not even come close to happening,".
Then he says Russia is not a big threat because they have been shown as a third rate power...but that is only because of the very Western assistance he criticises.
The third rate military power thing is true, but the steamrolling comment ignores the tactic Russia would likely take. Suppose that Russia marched in and took control of a town on the Polish border. Poland is a NATO member so that would trigger Article 5, but it's just one town. Do we really want to start a major war over one town? Especially if they promise that this is as far as they'll go?
Okay, sure, they took another few miles of territory, but that's mostly an empty area and isn't important. So what if our allies are screaming Article 5 and asking if NATO is really useful at all if it won't do the very thing it was formed to do?
