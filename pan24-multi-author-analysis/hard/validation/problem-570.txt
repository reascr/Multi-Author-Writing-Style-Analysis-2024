FFS please stop comparing student loan forgiveness to PPP loan forgiveness. Regardless of your opinion on student loan forgiveness, it's intellectually vaccuous to compare it to the PPP program. PPP loan forgiveness was not about "relief" -- these were loans in name only, taken out with the in-advance knowledge they were to be forgiven. It was basically a grant program borrowing the accounting/legal structure of a loan program.
This program is supposed to help out someone with student loan debt. That's why someone with no student loan debt doesn't get helped by this program. Not every single government program is for every single person in the country. I don't qualify for food stamps or reduced internet prices. I don't complain about that because I understand that not every government program is for every person. And that's okay.
"HEROES Act of 2003,” or “HEROES Act”), vests the Secretary of Education (“Secretary”) with expansive authority to alleviate the hardship that federal student loan recipients may suffer as a result of national emergencies.".
COVID is still a national emergency and it doesn't expire until March 2023. This case should get thrown out based on that, but with Republican judges, you can't be too sure.
