"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.".
Oh yeah. So, we should actively protest gun shows. We should punish businesses that carry guns, or allow gun owners to do business there. We should target schools that have guns mentioned in their criteria and ban that. We should refer to gun owners as dangers to our children. Maybe start calling them groomers. We should absolutely make kids show if there are guns in their house before they can play in sports. We should try and limit services to gun owners on religious grounds. Let's bully gun owners until they are forced to commit suicide. And while we're at it, let's have national level discussions on which bathrooms gun owners can use.
And even Portland itself, which has long been a posterchild example of a liberal urban hellhole among conservatives has gun shows pretty often. Well advertised, and get a good showing when they are in town.
Like most conservative culture war bullshit, there is very little (if any) nuance or even caring to understand the people being hurt by it.
And that is despite the fact that there are daily instances of guns being used to kill people. How may have died as a direct result of drag shows?
