So are you going to quit voting? Wasting it on a right-wing Libertarian nut? Vote for Christo-fascists who tried a coup? Lots of angry talk here. Better to try to improve the Dems than give the country to autocratic, gun-loving, hateful, racists and theocrats.
It's unfortunate the old guard and "centrist" bullshit still has such a stranglehold on the Dem party. They can win if they stop their bizarre obsession with white male voters - white voters in general. They aren't coming back for whatever reason. Continuing to be fascist light won't change that. Americans are progressive. Start fighting for progressive ideas and give the people something to vote for. That will never happen because the status quo benefits the Dem assholes as much as the republican assholes. They don't want anything to change and this guy Jeffries proves it. Just a minority face on the same old horse shit liberal policies.
Deny all you want but MOST voters are either center right or center left and most democrats are NOT progressives.
I think the annoyance is that the Democratic party fights progressives more in primaries than they do Republicans.
Take it as you will but most of these folks really do believe the way things are being done makes things better in the long run and they arent interested in progressives ruining that.b.
MAGA kind of changed that more than progressives did. The GOP personally feels helpless against MAGA in its own party.
