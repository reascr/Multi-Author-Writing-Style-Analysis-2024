Interesting stat is that the number of kids married couples have is actually pretty stable. The number that keeps going down and down is the marriage rate, and it’s not just in Japan. You have as the biggest impact the positive development associated with the rapid rise in social status and freedom for women, where as previously they were married off as soon as they graduate mandatory education, versus now where the majority pursue higher education or employment. The second biggest impact is that we also have far more entertainment options for single people. No one is spending their saturdays going out to bars to meet single people and have sex when they can curl up indoors and watch a good tv show or movie from their laptop. They can even get sexual gratification from just a single push of the button.
It’s a global issue and the only solution in a capitalist system is to make no changes and be satisfied with becoming a poorer country in the long run, or basically import enough people from around the world to remake your demographic makeup. There are no 3rd options. Robots and automation isn’t going to do fuck all but make like 2 guys in the entire country rich while the rest become service gig slaves.
For me the solution is simple, either robotics will help the shrinking labor force or they are destined to get a piece of karma back. Not working on culture reforms to accept other races sucks when you need people to work in your country.
Japan is one of the most racists countries for immigrants. Immigration will not work. Their economy has been in limbo for decades now after the 1990’s. They import most of their raw materials.
