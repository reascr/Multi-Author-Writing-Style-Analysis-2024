Many black citizens were stripped of south african citizenshio during apartheid, with their citizenships transferred to non internstionally recognised 'Bantustans' in formerly South African areas. This was done through the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act of 1970.
This allowed the apartheid government to claim many African South Africans were not, in fact, citizens.
The official definition for Apartheid doesn't include anything about a requirement of people having to be from the same nation. In fact nationality is listed amongst the possible reasons for discrimination.
The definition of the people targeted mentions "racial group". Which at first sounds like race only, but if you look online for definitions in regards to law it'll tell you this instead:
Of course you can argue that Israel is worse because they cause much more suffering due to being in the stronger position in this conflict.
That's what always annoys me, you must looks at the whole of the Middle East to see the full context that Israel exists in.
It's anti semetic if you pull a random Jew living in America into the bullshit going on in Israel. It's not anti semetic to call out the government for their bad actions.
