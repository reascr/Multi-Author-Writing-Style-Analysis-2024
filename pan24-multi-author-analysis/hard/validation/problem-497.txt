You’d be amazed at how many people really have no idea of what’s going on. I think you could find an impartial jury but I’m not sure you could find a competent jury.
As someone who recently sat through jury selection for the first time in my life, I’ve got to say I’m concerned about the chances of any competent jury for any crime.
Voir Dire is the process by which attorneys select, or perhaps more appropriately reject, certain jurors to hear a case." It also refers to the process by which expert witnesses are questioned about their backgrounds and qualifications before being allowed to present their opinion testimony in court.
I'm not sure about that not legally bar Trump from running for President again, if he were convicted of Insurrection, wouldn't the 14th Amendement apply to him?
Would the next president pardon him, assuming the trial was over by 1/2025? I guess the trial being over doesn't matter, you can be pardoned for crimes that you have yet to be charged for. Still not sure about the next president pardoning Trump, even if it is a Republican.
Other articles I've read indicate that this is what would have to happen for an indictment to be charged, but a lot of people on reddit have disagreed, saying Smith has independent authority etc.. I believe the articles like this one more than my fellow redditors, especially when it comes to indicting a former president.
