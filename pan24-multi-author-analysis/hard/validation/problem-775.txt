More like half the democrats I know. Probably half a dozen at least are full-blown socialist and several dozen are seriously anticapitalist and lean toward socialism but don't explicitly identify with that group full-stop.
What? You're not making sense. You're supposing that to be a "democrat" means to identify solely as a democrat. Most "democrats" I know are extremely disillusioned with the democratic party, and their identification with it is a very incomplete and approximate thing. But they still think of themselves as democrats.
And yes, I understand that the green new deal and wealth taxes are not part of the democratic party platform, and likely won't be in the next couple election cycles. But plenty of democrats are hard-core in that camp anyway, and operating under the naive/irresponsible/optimistic/mistaken/risky assumption that that's where the party is going.
If you're an actual communist - a term that is so often wildly thrown around with little regard for what it actually means - you might vote for Democrat candidates, but you're not a Democrat. Just look at their platform; if you interpret it broadly, it might have room for Democratic Socialists, but there's no mention of nationalizing industries, giving the means of production to the working class, abolishing the bourgeoisie and private property, etc. Supporting unions and universal healthcare doesn't make someone a communist.
