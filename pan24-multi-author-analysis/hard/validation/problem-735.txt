These people 100% knew what they were doing was wrong. They are 100% responsible for their own actions.
I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past and my mental health has never been responsible for making me do anything even remotely close to participating in a violent insurrection.
Attributing any of this to mental health issues is not only a scapegoat but further stigmatizes people with actual issues.
Just because YOUR mental health issues don’t render you susceptible to propaganda, doesn’t mean you can be dismissive towards the very real weaponization of mental illness by the far right.
Put another way, if this were the result of untreated mental health issues, it would stand to reason that at least ONE person who isn’t a right wing extremist would have been participating in J6, but there wasn’t. Because this has nothing to do with mental health.
Here's the thing: there are solutions to these mental health issues, the problem is getting them to take their meds. But, they've been brainwashed to believe they're mind-control and will NEVER take them. Better to just lock them up and keep everyone else safe for a while.
