Just remember, he could be removed from the House anytime, if the DOJ did their fucking jobs and enforced the 14th Amendment. Hell, the Dems had 2 years in Congress to do it themselves.
The rules are not the same for Dems and Republicans. Dems have to walk the fine line of civility. They're not all the best people. There are wealthy democrats too that fuck around. But when it comes down to the policies that are put forth, Democrats are significantly better. Many of them actually reflect on past positions, learn from their mistakes, apologize, and move forward to better represent what we want.
In the end, the story becomes about how Dems shouldn't label the establishment GOP what they are: fascist bigots keen on establishing an authoritarian gov't. This leads to people being able to hide behind the excuse of "politics is so tribal and dysfunctional" as a reason not to vote. And round and round we go.
It's not a major news story anymore. And if Democrats get aggressive when responding to the GOP's bullshit everyone will clutch their pearls about how sad the state of politics is or "Look at how terrible the Democrats are for calling Republicans fascists." Which is out of context because it's not necessarily the electorate, but the GOP politicians that are fascists. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of their base just doesn't get it that they're supporting fascism. The ones that do are complicit (most likely the wealthy) are just looking to exploit whatever pro rich asshole policies the GOP passes.
At this point anything on right wing media or that comes out of the mouth of a Republican politician, I assume is a lie. “Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.”.
