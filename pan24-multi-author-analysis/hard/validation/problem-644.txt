More like a reversed brexit yeah, scotts only wnated to remain in EU and they got dragged of it because the rest of the kingdom voted to exit.
Still, the idea of idependance was here way before brexit, it just conforted scotts they want to be autonomous even more.
The idea that Scottish "independence" from Britain is any more enlightened than a British "independence" from the EU is typical nationalist rubbish.
No issue with self determination in principle, although the idea that the UK is just a ‘union’ that you can leave, rather than a nation state, will always underplay the complexities of independence.
An independence referendum is really a case of dividing a country into two pieces. Except that one of the two pieces is unfairly not allowed to vote, even though they are affected by the event. So one half of the divided country gets to practice "self determination", but the other half does not. Actually even the losing half of the vote doesn't really get self determination unless they are allowed to vote to secede from the seceders. Follow this to the ultimate conclusion of everybody seceding from everybody else and you end up with a bunch of people just deciding which laws they feel like following.
