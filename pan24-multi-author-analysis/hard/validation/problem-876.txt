You mean the one that allows the federal government to keep operating, but also allows Republican governors to kick people off Medicaid in their shitty moron-filled states?
The reason this "problem" exists in the first place is because the federal government prevented states from removing people from Medicaid who don't qualify for it. If they don't qualify for Medicaid now because they have coverage from their employer or the ACA, then why should they still be on Medicaid?
If you read it then you would realize universal healthcare isn't something that would "solve" this because the solution is already present through their employer offering insurance or them qualifying for ACA plans and subsidies.
How would providing universal healthcare to everyone, thereby negating the need for employer provided insurance or the ACA entirely, not solve this problem?
I go back to my question - how would universal healthcare, which would negate the need for employer provided insurance, or the ACA, not solve this problem? How would everyone having healthcare provided to them through a single-payer model not solve this and a myriad of other problems?
How has there not been a collective alternative where a company takes fees from clients and just covers all medical expenses similar to canadian, Scandinavian or european countries governments do with their health care?
Is wrong because we are talking about healthcare COVERAGE not hospitals and the polling you provided shows that a majority want the system we have, which is a mix of government programs like Medicare/Medicaid and private insurance.
Most didn't, and you can tell because they're going off on rants about universal healthcare when the issue being addressed in the article is these people no longer qualify for Medicaid.
There's a reason people like me, union members, and others are against universal healthcare because it reduces the quality of care we currently receive. It also means dealing with the issues countries like Canada and Europe deal with in their universal systems that I and others don't have to.
