After a British gunman killed 16 people in 1987, the country banned semiautomatic weapons like the ones he had used. It did the same with most handguns after a school shooting in 1996. It now has one of the lowest gun-related death rates in the developed world.
The apparent progressive political majority in the polls might just be illusory. No, I don't think so. It just gets muddied up by lobbyists pretending that the bills hurt progressives...
Legislation is one way to push back, even if the legislation doesn't pass or gets overturned. It forces the corrupt to put their corruption on display. Not pushing back while waiting for the political landscape to change is exactly what the gun fetishists would love to see.
A 'gun fetishist' would say absolutely nothing to Democrats about their policy, Democrats are on a path to self destruction and most 'gun fetishists' would not risk getting in the way of that.
What I am advocating is for Democrats to regain control of government, which is not typically something that a 'gun fetishist' would advocate.
But with the current state of things, the public does not support strict gun control, and the political power does not exist to pass wide spread gun control legislation.
Once you have a large majority, if the culture of the country has shifted that gun control is feasible then you can pass gun control. Because you have the political power to do so and the public genuinely supports the legislation.
