“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,”.
"The strategy is not for defense, but for the defeat of the russian army and the victory of Ukraine. Leopard tanks will be followed by F16 aircraft, Atacms missiles and other weapons we need.".
Yep. Despite the West’s alignment with Ukraine and against Russia, the type and amount of financial and material support from them is and has always been a matter of strategy.
It is Ukrainians’ initial and continued tenacity that has made Western nations comfortable with sending tools to push Russia off the map in a standing land battle.
The West will rightly do everything in it's power to help Ukraine win as long as they are willing to fight, even as they grapple with the fact that they don't want to get directly involved.
But if by any chance, Russia manages to conquer Ukraine, it's pretty inevitable that because of that threat/geopolitics etc, sooner or later the West would have to go "fine we'll do it ourselves".
It should be obvious to any astute observer that wants peace that the best and perhaps only way for that to happen is for Russia to leave Ukraine.
