A Nation is A People, not People. There is both a specificity and an immortality to a nation that people do not possess. This is not the counter argument you think it is. Nations are defined by the common language, heritage, and traditions of its members, not the members individually.
Where did I say or imply that? I said we should call it what it is and thus lend some authenticity to our efforts.
Question: isn't sanctioning them until they conform to our preferred norms the same thing as imposing our ideals on them? You want to claim an anti-colonial stance, but economic imperialism ultimately has the same aim and effect.
Furthermore, you are right about economic imperialism. This is a classic lose-lose situation. Ignoring human rights issues, awful. Forcing your ideals on another society also wrong and ineffective. However to say we have to keep a morality out of a moral issue is just silly. As you said trading is our prerogative and having to continue trade in order to appear to not have a moral agenda spits on that idea. Sanctions the things that give the Taliban power but not the things people need to survive such as water, food, clothes, medicine etc.
