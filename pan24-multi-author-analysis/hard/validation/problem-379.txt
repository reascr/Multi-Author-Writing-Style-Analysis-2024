It isn't. Don't act like the poor Christian conservatives of Georgia don't willingly flock to the polls every election year to cast their vote for anybody with an R next to their name on the ballot. I'm so tired of the rich being the only people we blame for doing shitty things. The poor suck, too.
I was raised in the exact same environment, with the exact same economic status, and educated in not just the same school system but literally within the same schools. It was incumbent upon these people to make an attempt to educate themselves or at the very least listen to an idea that went contrary to what they've been taught, and they all chose not to do so. Yes the wealthy and the political ruling class have deliberately dumbed down the populous, but that does not excuse the people from never even trying to better themselves or to hear ideas that were not their own. The voters are also the problem.
A lot of people split their ballot. There's a reason Kemp isn't in a run off. Easy to imagine a lot of people who grimmaced and voted straight ticket but showed up for Kemp won't show. Also Senate control is off the table right now for Republicans, which also lowers the excitement for the straight ticket voters and might even swing a handful of voters who feel like they're voting to not have a laughingstock as a senator instead of for the Senate at large.
Hopefully there are enough sane republicans left who won't vote for this moron and the undecideds are aware enough of his problems to keep him out of office.
I feel like her apathy is going to hit many voters in GA that would normally be a lock for R but just can't stomach voting for Herschel.
I just talked to a GA voter yesterday that said she voted in the main midterm election, but just hates the candidates available and isn't going to show up.
