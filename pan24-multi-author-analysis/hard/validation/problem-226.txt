Thankfully, after Ukraine successfully defending Odesa and securing Kherson, the biggest threat Moldova faces now are blackouts instead of direct assault.
I think the only people who genuinely would (instead of saying it because they're told to) are people who don't know about Moldova. Everything Russia has said about Ukraine to justify its invasion applies just as much to Moldova, but the difference is that Moldova doesn't have the means to defend itself.
The only reason transnistia is even a thing, is because Moldova was too weak militarily to do much about it when they decided not to be part of Moldova.
With Russian military support not being the Trump card it once was and sympathy for Russian minorities trying to form breakaway republics at an all time low, there is indeed a path to catastrophe there.
The people in Transnistia do have their own identity, culture and ethnic background but few people will be sympathetic to their ideas of self-determination in a region where Russia just used that excuse to start an invasion.
