Moat states technically aren't done all together for a week or so after the votes are cast, you just get results early in chunks, and conclusions can be drawn with enough of those chunks.
Either ALL republican voters will show up because "we can't let the democrats have that much power!".
very true. i'm starting to think the powers that be in the gop are finally, really, going to try and cut off trump. but they have a very thorny problem with that.
so if dems get AZ and NV, and the gop gets GA, won't it be 50/50 and then harris is the deciding vote in a tie, giving them basically a majority in the chamber?
There is a good argument to be made that if dems get AZ and NV then GA will follow suit because a major motivating factor in the GA race for Republicans is senate control. With that gone a lot of people will probably stay home instead of voting for Walker. Which clearly they didnâ€™t want to do if you look at how well Kemp preformed vs Walker.
With Kemp not on the ballot, Walker was already going to struggle in the runoff. Hopefully Warnock will have even better odds now if the Dems pull it off in AZ & NV.
