And one of the coalitions in recent years had plenty of seats, the Gantz Bibi one. A full right wing strongman coalition has no hope of surviving. They can't compromise.
Ben-Gvir is courting the religious and secular right, not the ultra-orthodox. It's his first electoral rodeo, but like Lieberman and Bennett, he will soon discover that his electoral base clashes fundamentally with the Ultra-Orthodox parties.
It is a party pitching to a sector of people who are not orthodox or fundamentalists religiously, and carry a dose of right-wing nationalism.
Either he will radicalize and the right-wing will fracture, or he will become palatable and assume proper politicking, which will put him on a collision course with the Ultra-Orthodox sooner or later.
Either Ben-Gvir will move to pro-military policies and social left ideas that will put him at odds with the Ultra Orthodox, or he goes harder right that puts him at a collision course with Likud and the U.S-aligned establishment at large. Staying where he is--doing nothing and promising nothing--is the only way that this govt will survive 3-4 years. And if he does, he is politically finished next elections.
It's not that this coalition can't last most of their term. It's that Ben-Gvir, that made this government possible, will also be the death of this government. Sooner, or later.
