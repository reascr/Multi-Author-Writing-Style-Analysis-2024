That’s how I know people are brain dead from throating Fox News, thinking that by giving Ukraine money and weapons, they themselves are somehow personally affected and are against sending aid.
Don’t know who ‘we’ is in this case but sending billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Ukraine to beat back the Russians seems like a great option and is indeed being done.
Oh, oh, I know, we could go in and make the Russians stop and leave Ukrainian soil, and get everyone involved in war crimes to a tribunal. And we should help the Ukrainians to use force if the Russians won't do any of that willingly and they're fighting back.
Russia won't admit defeat and even if they get kicked out of Ukraine, Putin will find a silly way to spin the result as a victory of some sort.
But no one cares what Russia thinks or says, as long as we arm Ukraine to let them inflict as much damage on Russia as possible, and then follow that up by harder sanctions and complete isolation, the result will almost inevitably be the collapse of the Russian federation.
I do feel bad for any Russian civilians who are against the war and against Putin's regime, I really do and unlike many others in the west I am sure that they do exist, but there's no other way. Forcing Russia as a country into depression and preferably decades of internal fighting and instability is needed to send a message that this sort of behavior won't work and will backfire.
And before some idiot starts comparing this to Germany after WWI, this is more like Nazi Germany after WW2.. and I believe Germany paid handsomely for the war, they were broken into smaller states for decades and subject to foreign rule not to mention that the dickhead who started it was forced to shoot himself and his cronies were put on trial and many of them executed. If anything we're letting Russia walk away with light damage.
