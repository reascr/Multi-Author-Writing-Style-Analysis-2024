CSGO had a huge upswell some years ago and CS is doing fine as an esport, better than ever as an actual game in terms of technical aspects and balance. Lots of issues have been fixed and as it stands today, it's an excellent game with a very active community. So no sadness.
This is so sad. Ukrainians don't want to slaughter their brothers from across the border, but they are fighting for their lives. And Putin just keeps sending these kids to their deaths.
Never forget that these deaths are on Russia's hands and on the hands of the Putin regime. Every mother and father being told their child will never come home is a tragedy, no matter which language they speak, and it could be ended as easily as the stroke of a pen but for the arrogance of a man who has yet to realise that he's finally in over his head.
Never forget that these Russian soldiers need not have died were it not for the selfishness of the Russian commanders and Tsar Nikolai II Putin. His desire for legacy and a propaganda victory over a former SSR led him and his corrupt little henchmen to declare war against a sovereign nation simply because it wasn't doing everything Putin wanted. And now, with Belarus not also doing _everything_ Putin wants, he may seek to declare war on his own ally.
Russia's screaming about "we are fighting NATO!" without ever making a move on Poland, for example, also belies their claim to Great Power status. The only victory they can hope for, anymore, is an internal propaganda victory. Depressingly enough, it's working: hypernormalisation in effect, one supposes.
