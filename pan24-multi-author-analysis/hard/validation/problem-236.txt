Lol the Russians have lost more in 10 months of fighting than we did in Iraq and Afghanistan combined. There is no way they can last a decade. And yeah the arsenal of democracy should keep kicking the ever loving shit out of Russia for as long as that takes and if they want that to last another year or two, Iâ€™m here for it.
Which should be quite a while seeing as how Russia was our 2 enemy in terms of international politics and future wars, and we are getting a crazy return on what little money we've spent.
The war on terror cost trillions and lasted two decades. We've given Ukraine about $60B in military equipment and aid. They've ripped the Russian military apart at no small cost to themselves. They've shown us and the world that the Russian military is way more inept than we thought. Even China had to rethink their strategy after seeing how united the world was in aiding Ukraine and how fragile a nation-state Russia is when it comes to war against a nation with an actual military.
Question, given the monetary and military aid we're giving Ukraine, can that amount of funding go on for a decade, in the trillions, and or, if not, are we being fair to the Ukrainians to make them think we have an open commitment to them, for that as long?
Thank you for that submission, but i'm too old, and too smart to continue to listen these bs claims made by those in our media, so called "experts" at think tanks, and former floppies in the military that never won a war, since WW2.
Notwithstanding all of that, increasing the "Debt Ceiling" alone, with just Democrats is a task, let alone a Republican Party that is not one of the Neo Cons of the past that funded the "war on terror" (which was about our troops, not Ukraine).
