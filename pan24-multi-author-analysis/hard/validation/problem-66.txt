Rammed both of them into massive storms. It's such a shame. Zeppelins could see submarines at periscope depth, so not one ship was ever attacked by a sub while in sight of an airship or balloon. A couple of those flying aircraft carriers would have been real useful in the Atlantic during the early stages of World War II. And you know that airships would have gotten tons of investment over the 30s and 40s. Don't know if they would have survived jets and radar, but I am sad that I'm not in the timeline with badass flying aircraft carriers in World War II.
In the 1920s the US experimented with flying aircraft carriers. They built two Zeppelins that could launch and land fighter planes. They were called the USS Macon and the USS Akron.
There's no "gatcha" for them to be had here, unless they want to scuttle the first serious diplomatic visit aimed at deescalating tensions in years. I mean, what political capital would they get? The official statement form the Chinese side was that the thing was out of control and deep inside restricted American air space, the sort of air space that would see a commercial air liner intercepted by fighter jets and forced to land/shot down if it refuses. Of course it'll get shot down. During the Cold War the US floated dozens of those balloons over China and had a few of them shot down so it's not unprecedented.
we shot down a chinese spy balloon, that's all 98% of anyone will ever remember about this event, no matter what unfolds down the line.
