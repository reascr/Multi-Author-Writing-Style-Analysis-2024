Well, it's a mess specifically because the Serbs tried to butcher everyone to create an ethnostate and now refuse to admit that was ever the case and have tried to rewrite history as to make themselves out to be a victim because they were stopped. Serbs in Kosovo don't want to secede from Kosovo, they want it to not exist at all.
Frankly, it's amazing almost every issue in the Balkans involves Serbia. Serbia and Kosovo, Serbia and Albania, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina... Almost like the issue in the Balkans is near enough 100% due to the mentality of Serbia... If Serbs as a collective could simply accept the existence of others in the Balkans (I know, asking a lot here), that would pretty much solve everything there...
Or they could just go live in Serbia if they love that system so much, instead of constantly trying to undermine the transition to an independent country.
Absolutely agree. It's messy and not straightforward, but at this point both the Serb minority and Albanian majority need to just go with it and integrate together.
An independent and mixed Kosovo with its own national identity outside of Albanian/Serb is what I think everyone should hope for. It's an opportunity to bridge the peace and live together as a new nation. Any Albanians or Serbs that cling to their old national identities should indeed just go live in said nations.
The Serbs would argue the ethnic Albanians should just go live in Albania. See how that wonâ€™t get anyone anywhere?
