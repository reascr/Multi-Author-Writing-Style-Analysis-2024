Yeah, we've been gifted the gutting of the Russian military for pennies on the dollar. We're getting to test logistical and weapons systems as well as tactics in drone warfare. At least for drones, we're also building the muscle for doing extremely rapid weapons development and procurement outside the normally stultifying pentagon processes. It's like a war game to prep us for an eventual conflict with China.
I think China has very close eyes on how this is going and is really thinking about if it's worth it to invade Taiwan. I wouldn't want to go to war with China but would support it if they invade Taiwan like Russia is trying with Ukraine.
2025-2027 is what’s being predicted when China will invade Taiwan. They are making preparations at an alarming rate and in 4-5 yrs they will be ready. It’s scary to think about.
I agree. We are trying to deplete the Russian military so they can’t launch an invasion like this in the near future. It’s a war of attrition at this point and Russia is losing tons of equipment. They can’t product computer chips either so all those new aged tanks and rocket systems can’t be replaced. A drawn out war is bad for Russia and that’s what we’re doing. Sending enough aid to keep Ukraine fighting but not enough to win in the near term.
In the meantime supplying Ukraine with equipment, weapons and training helps them defend themselves.
This is a very poor take. The US and the rest of NATO have not gotten directly involved in an effort to avoid nuclear escalation. Ukraine might be putting serious hurt on Russian forces but Russia isn't facing an imminent threat to their territory from Ukraine and at least this far has felt threatened enough to employ nuclear weapons, US/NATO involvement would change that.
