It just struck me because I was like… “yeah, I’d just defect. Show up all white flag and hands up, be like I got fuckin sent here by that moron but he didn’t realize I’m just gonna use it as an escape, here’s some of our trash equipment”. Ukraine understands their foes are all conscripts, if someone’s immediately just like “fuck Russia, I’m out” and hasn’t done anything to them, they’re not going to hate you because “Putin forced me” is a fairly relatable problem for them. But better to make Putin think you’re dead for your family’s sake. Something Ukraine would also know, so I’m sure falsely reporting defectors as casualties would be a plan.
So while Ukraine is very likely overstating the Russian losses, 100,000 casualties isn't an accurate number either.
He added, “You’re looking at well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, same thing probably on the Ukrainian side.”.
It's very strange and deeply sad to see Russian soldiers dying in such enormous numbers, with so many of those due to injuries the US obsessively worked to make survivable a decade ago. They've been taken by corrupt and abusive men, transformed into rapacious villains and sent to die without the most badic protections, and for fucking what?
