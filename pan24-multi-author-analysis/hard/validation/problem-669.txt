We're moving out of state in a few weeks. Our son came out to us as trans at the end of last year. He's still only thinking in terms of going by another name, using he/him, having a shorter haircut, and wearing more masculine clothing. He isn't considering hormone therapy or other treatments. Even though this particular bill doesn't immediately impact him, I can only imagine that things will continue to escalate, with the way that things are going. I shouldn't be surprised at where our state is heading, but it seems like a new bill is introduced daily restricting the rights of Tennessee's citizens.
It's really sad. I wish I could remember where I saw it, but I recall reading language in a bill about restricting therapy services, particularly virtual therapy, for transgender individuals in Tennessee. They clearly don't want LGBT+ individuals to exist.
This will not stop with Trans people. They already hate kids and young voters. They will find more and more to hate. They are addicted to it. It is who they are.
That's true. I'm a Jew living in Los Angeles, where many Jews have already been attacked (including shot) and nazis are posting hate signs in many places. It's only a matter of time before the Republican party includes hatred of Jews as part of their official platform, like they have done with LGBT people.
The language the right wing is increasingly using in their attacks on the LGBTQ+ community (trans in particular) is the language of genocide, full stop.
That horrifying rhetoric will be followed by horrifying laws and horrifying violence by Republican mobs against trans people. Once they're done with that, they'll probably go after Muslims or Jews.
