Bwahaha you didn't get why I said South Asia here. It's because both India and Bangladesh have a shared history when it comes to US/West. In 1971 the US/West supported their "ally" Pakistan against Bangladesh (which was then called "East Pakistan"). US/West basically condoned Pakistan's genocide againt Bangla people during that struggle. When India intervened and helped Bangladesh and defeated Pakistan, US/West were furious. At one point US also sent their aircraft carrier into the Bay of Bengal but backed off when the Soviet Union called their bluff. Due to this shared history both Indians and Bangladeshi (and most of South Asia in general) have deep rooted mistrust of US/West.
That deep-rooted mistrust from Bangladesh also applies to India if you know anything about recent history lmfao -.
Hey doofus, learn to read. It say;s "South East Asia" - Bangladesh isn't part of South East Asia (it starts at Myanmar "Doofus". If you're going to try and correct me, at least be right and learn some geography lmfao.
I don't think Bangladesh and India has necessarily the same values though (anti-muslim bill being one example - and the country protesting Modi's visit) - but nonetheless, the US/West would rather have these smaller nations hosting these factories since they don't have the population to be a big problem whereas India does.
And 2nd, what does being an ally have to do with this? Simply said it's a better geopolitical move long-term to invest in Bangladesh and South East Asian vs. India - but you Indians are so mad lmfao.
