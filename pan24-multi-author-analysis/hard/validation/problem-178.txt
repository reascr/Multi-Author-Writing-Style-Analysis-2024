Because the guy paying the FBI agent is a rival to Putin. The narrative that this is more Russian collusion falls apart a bit when Putin isn’t behind it, but instead a Russian with deep links to Christopher Steele and the “Russian dossier” against Trump.
That’s important context, because it points to potential further Russia backed interference on behalf of Trump rather than a “Guy leading the ‘witch hunt’ against Trump was the real Russian agent” talking point.
And Manafort's business partner, Konstantin Kliminik, a former Russian citizen, believed Russian agent, gave the Trump campaign polling info to Russia. And fled the US after the election, and is now wanted by the FBI and has a $250K bounty on his head for information leading to his capture.
And he took money from Oleg Deripaska, the same guy that put Manafort together with pro-russian former Ukrainian president Yanukovych. Manafort owed millions to Deripaska when he went to work running the Trump campaign - for free. First action, remove 'Protect the Ukraine from Russian aggression' from the Republican party platform.
