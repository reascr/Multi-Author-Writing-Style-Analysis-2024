You should take some time to learn about the rise of the nazi party in Germany. The republicans are on the exact same track. Itâ€™s not watered down at all.
Is it watered down though? Some of the traits of fascism are religious fanaticism and rampant sexism which is exactly what this dress code is based on. I wouldn't say the terminology has been watered down, I'd say the racists and fascists have just gotten bolder.
We literally had segregation just a few decades ago and it was never referred to as fascist. I would say that was far more fascist than not wanting trans woman in women's safe spaces. Bigoted, sure. Statistically unlikely to have an issues? Absolutely. Fascist though?
Seriously? He was the first person to think transwomen in women safe spaces could be a threat to women? That seems unlikely, but I have no idea. My wife doesn't even ride in ubers anymore because of the harassment and threats she has gotten from men. I can sympathize with the fear some women may have with the idea of places that they actually feel safe having a change like this might be threatening. Maybe he was vocal about it? But I highly doubt he started it. It seems like a very rational fear, given what women have been through and have to put up with. It isn't fair to transwomen, and I think society will eventually be accepting of the idea, but I don't think every woman who is worried right now is a fascist or nazi lol.
You guys would have hated the 90s. Skirts, hose, and heels were mandatory at tons of jobs. I don't think these old farts are quite the monsters you think, just too old fashioned for modern job market and culture.
That is wild. I had never heard that before. Wait, groomers came from Hitler too? Now I just don't believe you. I can't imagine disapproval of adults grooming kids started with Hitler. I'll look into it a little later, of course.
