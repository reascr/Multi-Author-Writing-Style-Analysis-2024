Ukraine wants the German Leopard 2 tank. Germany should supply it. It is better for Ukraine to get the Leopard 2 rather than the US M1 tank because the Leopard 2 uses diesel which is what the Ukrainian tanks use.
A tank company of Leopard 2s will require 3 fuel trucks to fully refuel. The exact same is needed for a company of M1 Abrams. They will refuel at the same distance, and refuel at the same interval. The fuel trucks of the Leopard 2s will have some fuel remaining, but not anything worthwhile.
The ability to run literally anything in it for fuel, from jet fuel, to gasoline, to diesel, to heating oil, to kerosine, would actually be a nice bonus to Ukraine, where tankers could simply pillage whatever fuel there is in the area to keep running, vs requiring purely diesel that may not be available in the area and leaving their supply lines vulnerable to attack.
The fuel usage is grotesquely overrated by people who don't comprehend the basic figures they're looking at. It burns through far more while idle, but the difference when actually running is only around a 30% increase.
