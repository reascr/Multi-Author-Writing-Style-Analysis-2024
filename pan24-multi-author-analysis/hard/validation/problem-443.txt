Yeah, it doesn't track even a little. Even setting aside the unconstitutionality of it, most of the high authority of sheriffs was legally gone at the end of the English Civil War (Civil administration replaced a lot of previously royal prerogatives) -- which preceded the American Revolution by 120 years.
There isnt really a tradition that should have carried over in American common law, such as precedents or case law, since England hadn't been doing it for more than a century.
The funnest part is that the power they claim they have isn't even derived from the US Consitution, which doesn't mention sheriffs or their powers once. Their whole thing is a bad reading of common law, because at one point in medieval times, sheriffs had some of these powers.
Sheriffs were used to create and enforce feudalism in early England. Rural lands were often common lands, shared amongst the egalitarian populace. Private land property was not a well flushed concept in those areas.
Yup. It's very interesting that modern Sheriffs departments are often tasked with executing evictions even still.
