In my opinion it is possible that Biden might pull off a Reagan 1984 situation in 2024, where Biden runs the map except for Florida.
Regardless.. the real question isn’t whether Biden can get the necessary 270 over DeSantis/Trump, but by how far a margin Biden wins in 2024.
Name a few candidates who you think will do a better job than Biden, esp in foreign policy. Also, name me under 60 who is electable that is more "in touch." Age doesn't automatically make ppl more in touch w general population. A lot of it comes from their background.
Why do you think our system functioned well before filibuster? We literally had slavery, civil war, and countless social issues. We get rid of filibuster, we are literally dooming ourselves in 2024 when majority of seat up for reelections are democrats.
Ideally once Dems have all 3 branches again they can nix the filibuster and pass a shit ton of popular legislation and not give people a reason to vote for a right wing fascie.
“Nixing the filibuster would get rid of bipartisanship” but yet “Biden doesn’t have the bipartisan support to pass things rn.” If anything nixing the filibuster would force the minority party to negotiate and work with the majority party instead of just blocking every fucking thing. Also Republicans have nixed the filibuster on multiple occasions to get what they want.
The thing to do is to amend the filibuster down to like 55 or make it a talking filibuster again. But even that is incredibly risky given that Republicans could retaliate when they get power and remove it altogether to pass horrible legislation like a nationwide total abortion ban.
