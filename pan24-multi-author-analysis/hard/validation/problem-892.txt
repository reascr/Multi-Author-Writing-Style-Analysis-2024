Its virtually impossible to not have lots of paramilitary groups who are straight up nazi or fascist in ideological definition in such a scenario.
Its a poor as dirt poorer then many african countries nowadays country in europe fighting a conflict since 2014. And had historical prevelance of fascists with bandera and etc.
Also some out-and-about nazis that are part of the government military or something? I'm not too well informed on the exact details there.
Wasn't there like a genuine issue with ukranian nazi militias promoting themselfes at the beginning of the war? They'd flock to journalists covering the situation in order to promote their groups and stuff.
Like, Putin is full of shit about everything he says about Ukraine BUT they do have a pretty notable nazism issue as far as I am aware.
If Ukraine news gets blurred in the background, so would people support and political sanctions on Russia.
That's why they are coming up with all the laws recently which before the war were very controversial in Ukraine.
