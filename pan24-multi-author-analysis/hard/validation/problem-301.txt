Colleges are already under a lot of pressure to keep costs down as low as possible because they are competing against other schools for enrollment. Net tuition costs have basically been flat the past decade.
So if the rates have been flat and stay flat then there would be no issue on that end going forward. I’m the solution I gave, the schools could still change whatever they want. But if the government only gave a max amount like I mentioned and if private lenders didn’t stand to make as much and/or would have a massive amount of risk for a borrower defaulting, then students wouldn’t have access to as much money. Unless the students and/or parents already had money.
If a school wanted to charge $100K for a degree, but the government only gave $25K then the student would either have to come up with the other $75K or not go. It’d be that simple. If the school could operate like normal if student s decided to not go because of the price then there’s no issue in that case. But if the school couldn’t afford that and would possibly fail because of it, their options would be either to lower their prices and/or shutdown.
By doing that, colleges would either lose alot of potential students because less would be able to afford it. Or they’d have to lower their prices.
