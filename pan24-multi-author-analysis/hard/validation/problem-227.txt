Russia likes to whine about "NATO expansion" but all that really means is countries around Russia want to join NATO for protection from Russia, and Russia tries to portray that as NATO invading and taking over these countries.
And? in 2010, and public support for joining NATO remained abysmally low until after Russia annexed Crimea until after which it surged and then.
It was the same with Ukraine before Russia annexed Crimea, after that happened there was overwhelming support for joining NATO.
Not sure what part of this is so complicated for people to grasp - Russia's annexation of Crimea made Ukraine want to join NATO again, and dramatically increased public support for NATO in Ukraine.
LOL nice way to handwave away the fact that Ukraine re-started the process to join Nato after Russia attacked - and the claim he couldn't have been elected if Ukraine started to join NATO in 2008 is just straight up nonsense.
Application was withdrewed by President Viktor Yanukovich, who was russian puppet and who could never be elected if Ukraine started process of joining NATO in 2008.
And FYI - Ukraine was blocked from joining NATO after the Bucharest meeting, withdrew their application and the majority of Ukrainians did not want to join. It did not change anything.
