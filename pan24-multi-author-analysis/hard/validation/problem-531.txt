Maybe having all elements of society, the majority of the nation - commoners, and the holders of much of the wealth of the nation and a long view - the Lords, is a good idea?
Hmm, perhaps the House of Lords should have power restored to itâ€¦ make it an actual check on the power of the Commons.
EDIT: As funny as this was, I would for clarity like to point out that there are lots of other ways for the House of Commons to bypass the Lords.
Additionally, if the House of Lords rejects a bill passed by the Commons, the Commons can pass the same bill again in the very next session and submit it directly to the monarch, bypassing the House of Lords.
There are also a bunch of types of laws that the Lords are not allowed to reject or sit on for too long (mostly related to financing) which are not related to a law abolishing the House of Lords.
BTW, New Zealand already abolished it's equivalent of the house of lords in the 50s in same kind of manor, by appointing new members who voted for their own abolishment.
"So we want to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with an elected chamber that has a really strong mission.".
