I am wondering if one of them had letters printed on it of "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS HUGE FURNITURE DISCOUNTS".
The objects were balloons with no payload. They consist of a few ounces of rubber or plastic. Most likely actual weather balloons, or tethered balloons that broke loose.
It may have been some random dudes balloon, but it was almost certainly not an official weather balloon.
"You do know thats likely just and errand balloon with no beacon. We see those regularly over the years".
Infact not that different from say the Iranian incident of their air defences ordered to hair trigger due to expected violations. Only scale is different. Iranians in their error shot down a passanger plane, USA shot down an unmanned, unbeaconed balloon.
Like it is the most likely explanation. I would assume something like orders coming down from high "we have public pressure and spotlight on us, do not allow any unauthorized entities into airspace". Well military does job as ordered. Obviously the hobby balloon is not going to answer to hailing and most likely as hobby project they didn't spend the money to put a ADS-B beacon on it.
Also I think you haven't been paying attention if you think the balloons were discreet considering they were all spotted and shot down.
Assuming they are being deployed from a mothership or something within our atmosphere- how TF are they able to hide the mothership but not the balloons? The logic just does not make sense.
