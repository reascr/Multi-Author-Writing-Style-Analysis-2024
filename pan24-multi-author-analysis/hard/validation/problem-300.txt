But here’s the deal, China doesn’t care about Taiwan itself or its people enough to risk such a difficult operation. It’s more about the semiconductor factories, so “destroy it and leave it in ashes” is the opposite of what China wants. Oh and did I mention that these factories require people with very niche knowledge? Like “only the Taiwanese person who has been working on this factory for the past 20 years knows how to do it” niche knowledge. So not only do they need to capture the island which is hard as is, they should do it in a way that won’t damage the factories and won’t endanger civilians.
Oh I am not saying I am an expert, I am just a dude who read a bunch of articles, don’t get me wrong, but with that being said I don’t think it’s fair to assess my understanding of the situation based on a 5 sentence answer to a comment that mentions that China can simply blow everything up. If you read my next comment you will see me presenting the opposite case arguing why it might invade Taiwan. And to be clear since my comments kinda contradict each other, I don’t think China will invade Taiwan, but I don’t rule out such a possibility.
China hasn't promised not to use force to unify Taiwan, they in fact regularly repeat the opposite, that they will not rule out force in the future if necessary.
The X-factor is that if china doesn't invade Taiwan within the next 20 years they aren't going to be able to ever regain it back after that point.
On paper China does have the overwhelming advantage in air and naval power like the allies did, but it’ll be almost impossible to neutralize all of Taiwan’s anti ship missiles.
In such a scenario the US and it's allies destroy China's missile forces and then massacre any Chinese landing ship that even dares to put out to sea.
In such a situation the US would have as many of it's SBM submarines(Ship launched Ballistic missiles) as it could in range and basically massacre China's land based forces.
