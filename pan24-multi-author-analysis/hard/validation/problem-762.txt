The Black Sea fleet' primary focus has mostly been defending the southern naval approach to Russia from a NATO attack through the Dardanelle straight. This would in turn put the Russian fleet in the defensive sphere of their own land-based anti-ship missiles.
Im glad we agree. I should have commented on the other user claiming it was an arrogant move to keep these ships here. As if there was a better place for them to be.
Yeah, no, there is literally no other place for them to be. Turkiye would never let them leave and would never let any other ship enter during wartime. They're trapped in the Black Sea.
For all intents and purposes they are parking ships there. A navy without mobility is useless. And they are basically immobile. They're not allowed to pass through the Dardanelles. And as Ukrainians get higher range weapons and advance westward, they are increasingly hemmed in until they basically have to stay in port to be protected. And at that point, why even build hugely expensive mobile warships?
