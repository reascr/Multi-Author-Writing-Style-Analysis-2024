> The main legal department of Ukraine’s Parliament also noted in an analysis published this month that it had been given little time to review changes in the bill and that the legislation’s language gave insufficient consideration to the risk of introducing censorship.
The headline tells the passing reader that Ukraine is cracking down on free speech (typically seen as a negative among the general population), when in reality they’re passing legislation to allow them to join the EU in the future.
“But Ukrainian journalists and international press freedom groups raised alarms about the media bill as it advanced through Parliament, saying that it went far beyond what the European Union requires and accusing the government of using the membership obligations as a pretext to seize greater control of the press.” No.
Specifically the parts about how it goes above and beyond their requirements to join the EU and multiple press organizations inside and outside of the EU have said they should abandon this bill in its present state since it essentially gives the government the right to kill any story they wish during and beyond this war.
I’m more of referring to the European Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalism’s stances on the bill, who have advocated for changes to be made since it was being discussed in September.
While I agree the flow of information may need to be controlled during the war, the big concern I have is this will be in effect after the war, giving Ukraine the ability to suppress free speech whenever the government wants.
The only problem is this law can be used beyond the war, and should have been specified to end at the conclusion of the war to ensure it wasn’t there beyond that point. So even when the war ends, Ukraine, a country not exactly with a great track record for corruption, can use this to suppress free speech.
