This isn’t a game. It doesn’t matter at all if your neighbor who never votes reports to hate Republicans and support all sorts of wonderful progressive policies. They are part of the problem not as much a part of the problem is people who actively vote against those things, but a smaller and very tangible part of the problem of politics in the country.
They matter for political issues because they are potential voters meaning the "why" of the abstaining from voting matters. It can even be - and has been - a political goal to motivate people not to vote.
You seem to mainly wish to express your dislike of non-voters. The relative virtuousness of voting vs abstaining is not so interesting to me. I simply wish to clarify that political discussions simply have to include the general public, not just those who vote. Minors, who aren't allowed to vote, also clearly play a big role in political discussions. And that's because, again, politics and society in general are not separate entities.
In addition; and more generally, society does not exist apart from some segregated realm of politics. Both are heavily intertwined and impossible to separate. What happens in the political sphere leaks out into the cultural, social, economic etc. spheres and those in turn impact political agendas. So of course those who don't vote still have impacts and are impacted by politics.
