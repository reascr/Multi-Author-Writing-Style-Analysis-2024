You donâ€™t think a photo op of Biden scurrying to safety would undermine the symbolism of him being there in the first place?
In my version, Biden is a normal politician who didn't do anything atrocious, just pulled a harmless PR stunt like all other politicians do...meanwhile, in your version, Biden is a reckless, moronic sociopath who put his vanity above all else, lol.
And if the sirens were real, then that fact that everyone ignored them and went on with the photo ops makes absolutely no sense, does it?
You generally don't hear a real air raid siren and say "okay, time to go outside for those photo ops now." That only makes sense if the alarm isn't actually warning you of any real danger.
No, I think there was no reason for him to scurry to safety because he and everyone else there knew the alarm was meaningless and there was no actual danger.
Meanwhile, you seem to think that the alarm was real, and POTUS actually was in danger, but chose to ignore it to get a photo op. Your version is insanely stupid, because besides being an incomprehensible breach of security protocol, it would also mean that he was fine with endangering the lives of everyone else, not to mention plunging the country and the whole damn world into complete chaos, all to snap a few photos.
