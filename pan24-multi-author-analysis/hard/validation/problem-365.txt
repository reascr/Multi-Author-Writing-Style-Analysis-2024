Since the Syrian refugee crisis began, there's been a large amount of social tension and unrest in Sweden. Arab and North African migrants have been failing to integrate successfully into Swedish culture, instead forming ethno enclaves and parallel society.
He's doing this because as a free Swede, it's his right free speech, including burning the Koran. He's trying to agitate and prove that Islam and it's intolerant followers have no place in modern Sweden/Western Europe. Unfortunately, the violent backlash from the Swedish Muslim community is proving him right.
There is however a limit to how much contempt you can express against swedes, muslims and turks before it's considering inciting hatred against that group.
The distinction is drawn between the population group and the entity which is associated with them. For example, it's legal to say whatever you want about Sweden and Turkey and to burn their respective flags. Likewise, it's legal to insult any religion and burn their symbols.
What's wrong with burning the Quran? Is it gonna hurt Mohammed or Allah? I don't understand people who serve gods that need humans to protect and defend them. What's your god gonna do for you if he's depending on you to always do stuff for him. That sounds like a puny god, not worthy of anyone's fealty. Imo.
Ok, so I own a thing. It's my thing. I bought it with my money. Paid tax on it and everything. I can burn it, pee on it, put it somewhere unsavoury or even eat it. What I do with my thing is my business. I really don't get why anyone would care what I did with my thing as long as it didn't damage anyone else's thing. Not to mention that the correct way to dispose of a Qur'an is to burn it, so even in this instance, what kind of halfwit would care? You do you and I'll do me. I was a Bible person once. I have never cared what anyone did with a Bible. It's a book. There's billions of them. Who gives a shit if someone burns their own copy of the bible? Now if they did it in a mosque, that action would be very disrespectful, but the actual loss of a single book is irrelevant. There's lots more.
