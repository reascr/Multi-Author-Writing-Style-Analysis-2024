Looks like it’s the animal welfare activists saying not to. Which makes sense. People who panic buy a chicken likely don’t know how to take care of them. Plus if the only reason you buy one is because of the shortage, when the shortage is over people might abandon the chicken. And if you’re buying a chicken your probably getting it as a chick. By the time it starts producing eggs the shortage might be over.
And chickens take time to grow and start producing eggs. I suppose they could buy an adult, but still, panic buying any animal is never a good idea.
I'll admit, I am waiting to see how many people panic-buy a chicken, only to find out later they got a rooster.
And then once people who panic bought a chicken don't need it, or they realize what they got into, they'll just let it go in the neighborhood.
I think this is addressed more at people who don't know anything about chickens and have no idea how to care for one. I don't know what restrictions New Zealand has regarding livestock, but they're likely anticipating people living in apartments going out and buying a chicken.
