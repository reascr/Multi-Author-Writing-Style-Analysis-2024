Please be honest here, are you part of a Chinese propaganda machine? Or are you saying Taiwan specifically should shrink its borders because these islands aren't mainland? And what are your thoughts on all the other countries that claim territory far from the mainland?
Well it's interesting timing with the recent objects being shot down over NA. Maybe China is showing a card and the US decided Taiwan isn't worth WWIII?
While I do appreciate you offering some info, I ask about Chinese propaganda because it's clear you have a strong viewpoint on this matter and, judging your grammar, English is not your main language. I won't hold it against you, I just like to understand motives when I'm presented with an argument.
It is up to indigenous populations to determine whether they conform or rebel. To single Taiwan out in a world dominated by multinational imperialism is just strange to me.
The term Taiwan is a geographical and not a political. It only includes the main island. Although in media the whole whole territory controlled by the ROC government is referred to as Taiwan doesn't mean it's correct. It's like calling UK England or calling Scottish people English. What media calls Taiwan includes two provinces: Taiwan and Fujian, which includes Taiwan. The Kinmenese don't identify themselves as Fujianese and not Taiwanese. It won't change who rules over them or where their government sits. You don't call every American Washinonian do you?
I'm just saying the name Republic of Taiwan doesn't make to much sense of you want to refer to Kinmen.
What you mean by Taiwan refers to two seperate Provinces: Taiwan and Fujian( including) Kinmen. It isn't my idea, but the current administrative situation.
