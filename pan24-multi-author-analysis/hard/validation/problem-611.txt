Russia was always painted as like the final boss of a video game. I'm in my thirties, so growing up in the immediate post-Cold War world, I always saw Russia framed as our utmost existential threat. And for valid reasons.
This makes a lot of sense, thanks for the well-thought-out reply! I hope that if Russia does split that there is a minimum of bloodshed and border disputes.
Out of curiosity, what parts of Russia do you think should be split into smaller nations, what would it achieve, and do you see any potential drawbacks to splitting Russia up?
but there is the possibility of Russian oligarch building their own private army and splintering the Russian federation into smaller pieces.
So... this is a tough question because the long history of Russia has involved deliberate subjugation of groups and areas that have designs on independence. It's also involved deliberate prevention of any one area being self sufficient.
However... there's probably a case for some areas with either existing high population or existing levels of autonomy (i.e. they're already a republic within Russia's complex system).
