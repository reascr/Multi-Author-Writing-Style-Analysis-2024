I am just realizing that the whole war will be a slapstick comedy show one day. Putin being surrounded by yes-men who occasionally and randomly fall out of windows, troops that get to read super old maps that still show funny archaic landmarks, guns just breaking at the most inopportune moments, people surrendering to child's toy drones.. it's all just so absurd.
One of the weirdest thing about this has been the cases of soldiers sending photos of KIA enemy soldiers to their families over IM so that the Russians cannot pretend that they didn't die in combat.
Worthy of note that this program started under Obama by which the US provided substantial military support and training to Ukraine after the 2014 invasion is a BIG part of why the latest invasion met with so much resistance. The Russians found themselves fighting a Ukrainian military with modern weapons, modern training, and American military experts on speed-dial.
The US has been deploying guardsman to Ukraine to provide two to three week long training programs on using Javelins and other weapons since right after the 2014 invasion. The national guard is a great resource for this kind of training because they do those sort of short deployments and have a lot of technically skilled long-time soldiers available to do this sort of training.
