The direct quote. There's times it's appropriate to acknowledge human nature, that people can be good or bad, say if there is value in a good policy a politician made (I would use Trump as an example but I struggle to find anything he did well, operation warp speed?). But when it is "People call you Hitler but you aren't bad right?" and the answer is "ackshually"... there is a problem. Sure, technically not everythign Hitler did was evil, especially if you were a white German there were probably plenty of good benefits, but that's not at all relevant in talking about race and genocide and racists use it as a way to try and dilute the argument against racism and to humanize Hitler. Kanye is already awful but even moreso making this argument.
The rest of Kanye’s rant is even crazier than what’s quoted here. Kanye tried to credit Hitler for creating highways and the microphone as examples of the good Hitler has also done.
That's who Hitler was, and Kanye likes him. There is no horror movie ever made that comes close to describing what Hitler did, and Kanye likes him.
Now he’s saying “No, I like Hitler…” and they’re like “Oh… that’s what he meant.” Yeah no fucking shit that’s what he meant.
I don’t know where he got the idea that Hitler created the microphone, but I suppose he just got confused about the fact that Hitler used a microphone during his hate-filled rants? Close enough, I suppose.
When people like Kanye make claims along these lines, they completely ignore historical context. Everything the Nazis touched withered and died. You can’t even give Hitler credit for loving his dog, Blondi, because the lunatic decided to test his cyanide capsules on the poor dog to make sure they worked and ordered her puppies to be taken outside and shot after his suicide.
