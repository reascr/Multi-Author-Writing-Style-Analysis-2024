They rarely do anymore, but they probably will start forcing people coming from China to do all of the things they where doing in lock down and even make them get the vaccine if they font have one or force them to get back on planes and ho back to China.
Would the Chinese even accept shipments of the mRNA vaccines for its citizens even if it could save 10s of thousands or would they stand on nationalistic principle and refuse?
Also, which country would trust a vaccination passport from China? I can see that being forged and paid for.
Given their home-brewed vaccine is much less effective than the mRNA versions we have here in the west.
Recent studies actually show that a mix of an MRNA vaccine, combined with a more traditional one like Sinopharm or Sinovac in the form of a booster shot, gives the best protection overall.
discusses a study performed at Duke-NUS Medical School. It's of course a pretty limited study, which the article also states, but at least it makes sense, and looks quite promising.
The ineffectivity of Sinovac has been so overhyped. It still prevents death to nearly the same degree as MRNAs do, it's just not as good at preventing symptoms, or halting spread.
Chinese vaccine does what it's supposed to, it's just not as effective at stopping mild symptoms, or disease spread. The brain drain is definitely accurate though.
