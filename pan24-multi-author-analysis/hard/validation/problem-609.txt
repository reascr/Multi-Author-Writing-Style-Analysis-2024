Yes. Leave made a mistake by working secretly as paid assets of the Kremlin to undermine the UK. Remain made a mistake by not arresting them for literal treason. The EU made a mistake by not arresting them abroad and deporting them back home.
It's not the EUs fault and that was my argument. They do however make it possible to happen again. Imagine an almost limitless supply of cheap labour and if a worker is unhappy you're breaking the law, then they can be sacked immediately. No government is going to care about the locals if a company is making insane profits lol. I always wondered what the advantage was for the rich people who benefitted off cheap labour, but I imagine a lot of it was because they were power hungry parasites like Farage.
Also just checked, can't find proper statistics but more than 60% of people (that's the highest the map says) of the town voted leave. I am more than happy for anyone to give me good arguments I can make with the local people because I still work there often. My main one was if they didn't get cheap labour from Europe they'd just get it from somewhere else which was probably the most successful tactic.
It wasn't just the people in charge of leave that caused the Brexit issue. Near where I live, there's a town that has a big factory, and because of cheap labour from Eastern European countries the factory employed 1000s of them. There are like 12 people living in a small 2 bed house. The people who live in that town have seen a normal town suddenly overwhelmed by 10 times the population growth with no extra facilities, doctors clinics etc. I spoke to people there, and some of them didn't even know who Farage was, they just hated the fact that because of the EU, this factory could import insane amounts of workers on terrible wages and basically ruin their neighbourhood.
