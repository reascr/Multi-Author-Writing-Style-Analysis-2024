Most voters don't give a shit about platforms. They care about who reminds them of their own father that they're missing. The stern angry father.
I will give you some specific examples. Very few people want social security or Medicare to be cut. The problem is the perception by most trump voters is that most people on welfare are urban poor when In fact a lot of them are rural poor.
The Republican party is doubling down on its old failed policies that even most Republican voters did not like. They are not learning that they need to focus on identity with the exception of DeSantis who is focused on such a narrow myopic topic. Well, two of them. One of them covid is now irrelevant. Nobody cares what he did 2 years ago because it's over. We all have natural immunity.
Well they agree with Trump and not the rest of the party. It is much more an indictment of the rest of the party for being out of sync with their voters.
It's more of an indictment on the Republican voter base than anything else. The fact that they revel in their preferred official fallaciously lashing back at his critics who are bringing up valid issues.
