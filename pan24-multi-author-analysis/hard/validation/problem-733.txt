He knows the lie that he didn't utterly shit the bed so badly historians will study it for generations, won't live for long after he's gone and so he desperate to salvage a win somehow.
It seems Putin believes the West will end this war with overwhelming conventional force if he uses nukes, which is a very important consideration as I think he'd try, just a little one to scare Ukraine into submission, as seems to be overwhelmingly the goal of Russian military strategy, if that hadn't been 'leaked'.
Since the war began, it's been infuriating seeing so many people criticizing the west for escalating and forcing Russia to invade Ukraine and trying to argue that we should be seeking diplomacy instead of sending more weapons. Yeah, because US soldiers are raping and torturing Ukrainians in Ukraine, and Putin gives a shit about diplomacy. Oh wait ...
Europe (and Ukraine) needs to be preparing for US support collapsing when Republicans take the presidency. We need to be able to keep Ukraine in the fight without relying so heavily on the US.
They need to resist the Russian offensive in Donbas, until the new western equipment is ready for use.
