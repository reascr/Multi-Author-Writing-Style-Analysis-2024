So, 7 House Republicans who voted in favor will be out of a job in 10 days anyway, and the other two will be out of a job in two years. It blows my mind that the GOP is totally OK with crippling government operation just so they can try to make Democrats look bad. Just wait until the vote on whether to raise the debt ceiling or not.
Please explain how you think failing to raise the debt ceiling will reign in spending. Also please outline what you think the consequences of such a move will be. In detail, please.
The only other alternative is continuing to be held hostage by insane, right wing terrorists who are willing to set the house on fire with everyone in it to save the house.
Honestly... Ok? We know their play book for Jan 6th and we don't have a president who will sit idle hoping they succeed this time at toppling the government. We may get to find out who will really win in a battle between 2nd amendment LARPers and the military...
As we know the parties realigned from the 50s into the late 60s, so one could say this is literally the same through line effort that abolitionist Republicans were afraid of now being represented by modem day conservatives.
