Perhaps they are doing this to ally with Russia TO GET NUKES. They aren’t idiots who think they can beat NATO. But Russia needs money and support and has the one thing Iran is really looking for.
Until Russia, as repayment for their help, starts providing Iran tech support for their military. Israel is not going to let Iran strenhen itself sufficiently to be an actual threat.
As much as I disagree with much of Israel’s politics, they are exactly right to prevent Iran from accumulating weapons. The friend of my enemy is my enemy….
So the safety of the West specifically would take a hot, but also the world because proliferation means more opportunity for use.
If the wests democratic might is put behind its millitary there is really nothing that can stop it. Oh yeah, except maybe nukes, so let’s stop that.
I find it really hard to come up with a scenario that the majority of Western populations will agree with a brutal invasion of a weaker opponent. But Iran getting nukes is one of them.
No they are not or else they would have shut down Iran selling Russians missiles. To be honest they have done almost nothing lately. Their silence is deafening.
