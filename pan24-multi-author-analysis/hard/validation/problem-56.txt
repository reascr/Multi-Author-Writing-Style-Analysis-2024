Also forgetting to mention, instigating the world's largest and most effective military alliance isn't exactly the best idea when their military is getting embarrassed in ukraine.
I have no doubt that Poland doesnâ€™t want war, but your government has always been a great ally as far as standing with NATO and Ukraine against Russian aggression. And there are polish volunteers in Ukraine are there not?
Honestly a part of it stems a lot from our (American) relatively common feeling of protectiveness over our Eastern European allies compared to the wealthier nations to your west. Some of us really appreciate how outspoken Poland and the Baltic states have been during this conflict, and the fact that your country actually meets the NATO GDP to defense requirements is not lost on those of us who stay informed.
Even though they're not talking about Poland at all (read the article), Poland is a member of NATO and thus the accusation would be accurate, even if false.
Just another american thinking he knows exactly how Poland and other european countries work and think just because he read up on wikipedia about your history.
See, I'm teaching by example so he will learn. I also never said that ALL americans want war and says those things. However the people that do say these things here are almost always americans, thats just an observation.
I see this narrative about Poland a lot here, guessing it's mostly from americans. I swear they get hard while they're thinking of it.
