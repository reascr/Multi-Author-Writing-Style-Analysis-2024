They don’t care. They’ve never cared about this kind of stuff. Some lives are destroyed and lost?? Pfffft, who cares. “Some of you may die but this is the price we’re willing to pay” is literally the central thought of how some people view countries around Russia.
Somebody once said that Russia is in WWII-death cult, in which they see that killing the enemy and be killed in a fight against nazis is one of the golden dreams that most modern Russians (who have grown up under Putin’s new “Stalin was great!” country) should strive towards. If you grow up in such an environment, all these crimes you listed are just badges of honour against your perceived enemies.
In Russians’ eyes, at least those who truly support putin and his megalomania, Russia cannot be the one committing such crimes because crimes against humanity are only committed against innocents, but clearly - Ukrainians and anybody who is anti-Russia (read: anti-Purim’s Russia; anti Russia that is an empire and PITA of its neighbours) is not an innocent and therefore deserves the most painful horrific death ever.
The US didn't exactly plant the bodied of thousands of executed Ukrainian civilians behind the Russian retreat from eastern Ukraine, or ship thousands of kids off to Russia, oe have tens of thousands of rape victims, or make videos of Russian forces torturing and castrating Ukranian prisoners of war.
Russia doesn’t need the US’ help to “demonize”… They became demons shortly after their initial invasion… all by themselves; raping women and children… torture… shooting civilians… mass graves… blowing up hospitals and civilian apartments… the demons will pay. They will pay with everything they have, including their freedom.
