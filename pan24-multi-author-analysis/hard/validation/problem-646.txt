Yes, on a personal level it sucks for the athletes but Russia deserves no such international platform to pretend they're still part of the rules based international order of nations.
IIRC I remember seeing that the official Russian federation team are banned but Russian athletes could still compete as a russian team of some form.
Could be made quite simple that Russian athletes that don't support the war could be allowed to compete under the Olympic organisations flag. Afterall, the actions of the state does not speak for the view of everyone from that state. This isn't going to bat for Russia, just stating an option that exists with the International Olympic Commitee which could be used for a select number of athletes if they meet criteria. I'm not particularly interested in making it an ethnic thing, I'm more interested in the Russian state being repulsed and punished.
Zelensky is always going to go for the maximalist position, naturally (as has, tbf, Putin). The rest of the world can take what it views as reasonable. I personally agree wirh the IOC, but some others won't. Meh. Is what it is, I'm not particularly interested in bashing Zelensky even where I disagree with him. That's just politics, he's playing to the Ukrainian audience, who have understandably very strong feelings on this.
Just noting the mechanism that exists for those who can't compete as their nations representatives. It happened to some Russian athletes before, as well as some stateless people from Syria and Somalia iirc.
But don't underplay the sheer size and organisation that has happened with Russia athletes. To the point where it was organised and sponsored from the top down.
