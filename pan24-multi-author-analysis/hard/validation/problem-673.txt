It is astounding how people think isreal = jewish. Nah dude...a country is a country, and a people is a people. A country can be informed/led by a religion or culture, but it is NOT that religion nor culture.
This is the same reason you can Hate china and not be racist because you Love Taiwan and Hong Kong. Chinese isnt only in one place, Jewish isnt only in one place. Anti-semitism has literally no meaning in it that is connected to Israel.
you cant criticize israel without it being labeled “antisemitism!”: 25%ish of the world is muslims. the grand mufti met with hitler to help him out before israel was ever founded... jews face more hate crimes per capita than anyone else in the usa. the UNHRC condemns israel about as much as all other countries combined (46%). it IS mostly anti semitism. to shit sooo much on the one jewish country for defending itself against hamas who makes no distinctions between jews and israelis in its founding charter as stated above. furthermore. it is an offensive. stupid. strawman. trope. that i cant tell the difference. as a jew. when it is anti israel vs anti semitism.
Having a weird, seething hatred for Israel almost always ends up with the person being an antisemite. Like, almost always.
