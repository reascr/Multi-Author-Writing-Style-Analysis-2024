The funny thing is that the vaunted Russian anti-aircraft weapons either don't work very well or are non-existent. You'd think that Engels Air Base where all those nuclear bombers that were firing cruise missiles would have a decent anti-aircraft defence.
They were all correct hypersonic missiles currently have no defense is what I was saying. I described their characteristics exactly how they function unless you can provide me with an article that proves me wrong. But from what I remember that is exactly how they function and I have yet to find anything that details otherwise.
It's apparently enough research to prove my point. Also my link is stating exactly what I said hypersonic missiles are in use in Ukraine if you look at the edit on my main post.
But are you surprised because it's obvious that all their military budget has been spent on seeing the equipment in use in Ukraine.
We thought that their military budget was being spent on the military equipement until ukraine when the extent of corruption & vranyo and its impact on the russian military became clear.
