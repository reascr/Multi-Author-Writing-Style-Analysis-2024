I mean we will see how much influence Belarus actually has over it's army. Considering there is a Belarusian military unit in Ukraine fighting Russian that can always return home I doubt they actually deploy or it lasts long than Belarus government. Also a civil war in Belarus would force Russia to divert military power to Belarus.
I think now we can see the Russians have an attrition based strategy, they must want to pull the Belarusians into this.
In fact, the very prospect of a Russian lead push from Belarus must make UKR high command salivate when the alternative is the ongoing attritional slugfest in the Donbas.
I personally think Luka should stay out until he sees if the new western equipment leads to a Russian defeat, if the Russians are still fighting then Belarus should join the Russian side.
Russia has loads of internal security troops, they will be sent not the military fighting in Ukraine.
Well Ukraine will have a large number of troops near the border with Belarus, because that's where Russia launched the original attempt to take Kyiv from last year.
Kyiv is not that far from the Belarus border, and so requires a lot of protection from attacks originating from there.
