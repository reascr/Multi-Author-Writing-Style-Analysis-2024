Which it is doing. Its not about the weapons it is buying and r and d for their own manufacturing which it is getting. They are getting half priced energy which they can dump along with the savings into their already exponential modernization and growth of infrastructure which is badly needed.
So yeah I get it. If we want India on the west's side... maybe make it worth their while or we can deal with them gouging and leveraging the fuck out of Russia.
In case of a China/India conflict, Muadib, it’s anyone’s guess whom Russia would support. They have fingers in both pies. Trouble is - the Russian Knight already died inside his rusty armour….
If Redditors want to know why, it’s simple. Self interest. Much of their airforce consists of Migs. Many of their naval ships originated in the old USSR and are maintained using Russian tech, and their army uses Kalashnikov rifles and Russian armaments. Are they gonna condemn Russia for their little, er, ‘Special Military Operation’? Nooooo sir.
True. But it’s also gone if the US loses its patience. It’s gone if Germany ramps up Leopard 2 production. It’s gone if Putin’s ingrowing toenail turns out to be fatal. It has an economy the size of New York State. If it didn’t have nukes it would be the remnant of a joke. It is the second regime most urgently needing to be offed. After North Korea.
