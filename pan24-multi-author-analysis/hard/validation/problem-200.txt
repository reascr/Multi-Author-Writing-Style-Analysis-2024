With the population density being so high on top of the other two factors, there is a very high probability there will be even more variants and a complete collapse for a multitude of different parts of the economy including healthcare, education, tourism, manufactorong and so on.
Their vaccine isnt as strong as a lot of the ones from the west and because they were forcing mass populations to shut down the passed three years when they spotted a single case they never had chance of gaining a herd immunity.
What China did was lock down, but due to their closed government - refused to use any western developed vaccines which were seemingly much more effective than the indigenous Chinese vaccines.
Basically - most other countries locked down, until vaccines became available as it was necessary to do so. Then they slowly started to reopen, bit by bit. This meant their populations were highly vaccinated, and herd immunity in the public was strong from infections.
The prolonged lockdown meant that on top of having a weaker vaccine, there was a lack of herd immunity. Instead of gradually opening things up bit by bit like the west, China just completely abandoned their lockdown and are now suffering for it.
