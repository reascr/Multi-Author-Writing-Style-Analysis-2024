Yeah and that was like last month, it's only going to get colder. Ukraine should just wait for them to freeze to death. Pretty messed up that is like genocide by Putin on his own comrades. Pretty dumb to knock out the energy infrastructure when your own troops are freezing to death.
Let's not forget that Putin could end this war tomorrow if he wanted to, the news should make that the headline. Their is no shame in retreating. Even if it is career suicide for Putin, boo hoo.
Putin is getting old and maybe dying. I think he wanted to see some Soviet glory restored in his lifetime, hence the invasion. His goal is nothing less than the annihilation of a non-Russian people and culture. I wouldn't be surprised if he attempted to annex Belarus too before everything is said and done.
Eventually Russia became upset with Finnish independence and invaded them, just (as you said) throwing bodies at the problem. By sheer numbers they forced Finland to concede some territory.
Their military strategy is entirely dependent on manpower, not technology or tactics. They also vastly, vastly overestimate the soft power of Russian culture.
