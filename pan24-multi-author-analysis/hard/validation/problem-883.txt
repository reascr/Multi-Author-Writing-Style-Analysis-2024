The only ones they have thousands of are S300s, which have limited range (<120km) and are far older and less reliable.
So the expectation is that Russia will continue to use cruise missiles and Iranian drones for long range strikes, and they are very limited in their stocks of those while their hit rates are getting worse and worse.
Russia is firing more cruise missiles than it can produce but assuming they are going to run out is wrong. They have been trying to increase production and there are serial numbers found on missiles indicating they were produced this year.
Those articles were from 30 days into the war, when Russia supposedly ran out of half its missiles. We are 300 days into the war and Russia is still running out of missiles. At this pace by 3000 days into this war, we can safely assume that Russia will still be running out of missiles.
Russia uses more than 70 missiles per attack to ensure saturation of Ukrainean air defence. Depending on how many they throw at once that means 3,4 attacks.
Yes, thats why the news statement is that they have enough missiles for another 3,4 massive 100 missile attacks. They can choose not to fire the last 400 missiles at Ukraine and then they won't run out. Estimates can only be made based on consumption rates and guesstimated production rates and stockpiles. Their consumption rates have gone down a lot since March.
