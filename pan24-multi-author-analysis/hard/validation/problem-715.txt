A grand jury judge probably won’t make any statements, but grand jury members should not be talking before the Fulton County DA either announces charges or announces a declination. It seems like this special purpose grand jury member got baited by Trump’s, "total exoneration1" On the other hand, if no names are mentioned, then it’s less damaging to the prosecution than it could be otherwise.
Or she’s shrewd as hell and is working hard to create a slippery veneer of impartiality, knowing that as soon as indictments are released she and the entire grand jury will be personally attacked by the GOP.
BTW, there's also that woman 'Emily' who was on the Grand Jury who gave an interview to media, and her actions in this regard most likely have compromised the case to the point of destroying it.
The, "there's a guy who lives in Florida and plays golf and loves fast food and cheated on his wife who we're thinking about considering charging, in a while, quite possibly, if the stars align, with various crimes in Georgia. We may just do it, one day, in some other Universe... SMH.
