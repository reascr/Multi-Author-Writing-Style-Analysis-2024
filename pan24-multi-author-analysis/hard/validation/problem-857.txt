I think part of it is that rent is a lot cheaper. Back in my home town I was paying £499/month for a 1 bed apartment. Now im in a big city and am paying £650/month.
There was a post on /r/ukpolitics about how most people would need a £49k salary to be comfortable... the average salary in the UK is £30k.
If we take £50k to make calculations easier, once you deduct taxes, pension and student loans, that leaves you with like £2800/month net income. So yeah, you can have a pretty comfortable life on that if your rent + utility bills are less than £1000/month.
Food, gas, utilities and rent is where all of our money goes and we mostly live paycheck to paycheck. We are both looking at our future more and more as time goes on. Save small amounts at a time and you will see your savings grow.
Don’t think you have to save up a lot every time you do save. Just save $5-$10 if you can. Start small watch it grow. Don’t feel like you have to be rich at a young age.
Take it in strides and don’t feel like you need to be rich right away. That only works if you grew up wealthy which I did not.
