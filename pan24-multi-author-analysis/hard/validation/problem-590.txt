Mills, who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, could not be more different. He is among several new House members who denies that President Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election. A veteran, Mills also bragged in his campaign that he “sold tear gas used on Black Lives Matter protesters.”.
“Per the letter, the grenades are inert, and were cleared through all security metrics,” Mills spokesman Juan Ayala said in an email. “I just wish they tagged our official account.”.
Mills won election to represent Florida’s 7th Congressional District in November, flipping the seat that was formerly held by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), a member of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob.

“I am honored to be a part of the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees,” Mills wrote. “In that spirit, it is my pleasure to give you a 40mm grenade, made for a MK19 grenade launcher. These are manufactured in the Sunshine State and first developed in the Vietnam War.”.
