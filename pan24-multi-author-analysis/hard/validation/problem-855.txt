Tesla is the only major car brand that skips dealers and does direct to consumer sales. Honestly, I’m not sure why more companies don’t do this because it’s good for everyone except the dealerships.
It’s just people with more money raising the prices for people with less money and dealers keep the difference of price for every sale.
If the MSRP is $20,000 and you are willing to pay $23,000, but then people with more money are willing to pay $30,000… they will sell it to the people who want to pay more. Then you have to buy an $18,000 car for $21,000.
In automobiles you have to spend money before you make money. As you move into EVs you have to spend. And you get it back as you sell cars. It happened to Tesla. Suggesting it's a bigger impediment for VW is bizarre. As they sell more cars the costs will amortize and retrospective views won't even show they lost as much on those cars as current figures do.
I think the issue is that there isn't any reason car companies couldn't take on this same fluctuating price practice. So your example does really apply to the reason for (or against) dealerships.
