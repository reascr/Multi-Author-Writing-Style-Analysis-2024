It's not like they are getting royally shafted here though, what passed was the agreement that was accepted by all 12 union leaders initially, and was accepted by the members of 8 of the unions.
The very same unions that agreed to let congress arbitrate and adhere to what they came up with, even if that meant the compromise option 52% of them weren't in favor of because it didn't go far enough.
You want to know how to make shit like this better in the future? Actually vote in more of the people who actually voted in favor of this, rather than blaming them for it not passing through the senate, with 50 GOP Senators waiting to filibuster the shit out of anything good for the country. But sure, keep blaming the dems for the GOP shooting you in the foot.
So you agree that Republicans also deserve the most of the blame? All youre doing is criticizing dems, who all voted for it but one, while nearly all the Republicans voted against.
The fact that you're taking this and somehow framing the Dems as the evil ones here is just....clich√©.
Except that we expect Republicans to do evil shit. Not much we can do about that just yet. We equally expect Dems not to side with them on this sort of bill. Or at least, I sure as hell hope we're holding them to a higher standard than the would-be-fascist/theocracy party.
