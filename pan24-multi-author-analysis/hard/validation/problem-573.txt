It also speeds up the permitting process for renewable projects and grid enhancements (needed for more renewables).
In addition, and this is the single most important point -- it'll accelerate the development of zero carbon energy projects by largely fast tracking them through the approval process. It's terrible (and this is a self own on behalf of progressives when they decided to ally themselves with fossil fuel saboteurs looking to kneecap nuclear energy) that our energy projects take 6 years of review before anything can even start construction.
If the 369B for clean energy projects passed in the IRA are going to do anything in a meaningful timeframe, Manchin's deal needs to pass. We can't allow for zero carbon energy projects to stall out in regulatory limbo for 6 years before even a single shovel hits the ground.
Gas is less carbon intensive than coal! This pipeline might reduce our carbon output if it gets built because it'll reduce the usage of coal.
Like it or not, we will still be dependent on fossil fuels for a while, but a gas pipeline isn't as bad as coal or oil. Even if we stopped all fossil fuels now, energy needs of the world are too high. Small steps are better than no steps.
Energy infrastructure isn't capable of providing the energy needs with renewables alone yet. Plus, cars and trucks are still manufactured to use petrol and getting everyone to be able to swap to electric cars will take decades. Battery tech is still not quite there yet, plus cost is prohibitive for many who can only afford older cars.
Electricity generation, buses, trains, planes, and yes cars do count because they are vital to the economy, be they trucks carrying loads cross country or cars people need to use to get to work/everyday tasks because there is no viable form of public transportation in their areas.
