It's a well thought out and explained thread for sure. My honest opinion is the rumblings of an attack from Belarus are a distraction or an attempt to divert Ukrainian focus away from the front but more specifically the Russian's are sabre rattling because they're beginning to fear losing Crimea.
Ultimately even if Putin tries attacking from the North through Belarus it doesn't seem very viable, their forces and supplies are lacking, the defenders are far more prepared, they risk a repeat of "CONVOOOOOOOOOY" and we know how much of a shitshow that turned out for them as well as the only roads being narrow and easy to snipe them from.
also, Putin is supposedly in Belarus so nothing will underline RU their failure to Luca's army as Russia wasted so many people only to lose all their gains at the will of UA in a few minute's time.
Lukashenko is also perilously close to losing power too, he's only somewhat secured right now only because of Putin but if he sends his own military in he loses his only insurance against being Mussolini'd. If Putin tries to remove him it's likely to backfire too. The chance of Belarus attacking remains low and unlikely simply because they not only lack enough forces but they would be seen coming.
presumably Putin almost had to do this now lest Russia come out of the war so weakened that they can't merge Belarus later. Whether they can even pull it off now though seems a really big question.
