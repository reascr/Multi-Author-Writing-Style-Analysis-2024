But I saw a post on conspiracy where they claimed it was big media making up the lie about very fine people..Even though there was like, ya know, video of him saying this.
I'll give you a hint you dense loaf of bread: Trump says what needs to be said in interviews, but when he actually acts, he's a hugely racist piece of shit. Keep deepthroating the Trump boot though, yall are doing great with the streak of election losses.
It's really quite a big deal that Trump is such a loser. We should all keep in mind that he's a loser. And he lost to sleepy Joe, which really highlights just how much of a loser he is.
I'm not sure why anyone would want Trump to be their candidate given how he's actually a loser who lost.
There are far too many solid Republican candidates to choose from to worry about Trump. Yes he has a fired up base, but can that base carry him out of the primaries. No, his time is past. Ron DiSantis is the future of the Republican party.
With the GOP trying to oust trump, I expect to see more of him and other anti-trump republicans getting the spotlight.
Not that you should be fair to Christie (he's not a great person), but he's one of the few GOP members that have been consistently critical of trump and trumpism. Likely why you don't hear much of him now lmao.
