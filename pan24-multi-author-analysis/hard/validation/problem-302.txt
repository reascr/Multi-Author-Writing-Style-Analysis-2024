Seams very plausible given the size, density, and height, not to mention it's was shot down over uninhabited parts of the Yukon, in the winter.
If it was a hobby balloon like is suspected, it was likely vaporized (colloquial speaking), stuff can drift for long distances, and we do NOT understand the science well enough to predict debris fall with that much accuracy, and a long history of losing debris from downed air traffic, regardless of how, why, where, or when it's downed.
There's also the expense of looking for it, and what real motivation to hide it? Either it was a civilian balloon, or a Spy Balloon (possibly from China), confirming either will not do any harm to either administration (US or Canada's) at this point.
The US government also ran multiple flybys and observed the object for 14 hours before shooting it down period I'm pretty sure they would be able to discern if it was a balloon in that time.
The US military repeatedly said they were not balloons. The White House Press spin people said they were. Also this seems like it would be strange to say about balloons:
I highly doubt these are aliens I'm not staying that. But I'm saying there sure as hell not balloons and that people should not be buying this absolute BS.
