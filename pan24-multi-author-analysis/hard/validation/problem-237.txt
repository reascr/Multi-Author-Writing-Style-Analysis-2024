You have to give them time to actually read what they’re voting on. Not allowing that is absurd and to not be able to discuss with colleagues is also absurd. The only thing we should actually change is going back to the talking fillibuster so that the minority can never indefinitely block a vote and to make more ways for the minority (or anyone) to force a vote on the floor so that it forces moderates in swing districts to actually vote or not and potentially lose their seat if they vote poorly and not hide behind the majority leader blocking uncomfortable votes.
Do you not know what the talking fillibuster is? It means that any member can keep a bill open for debate so long as they are actually standing up there and debating it’s to prevent people from rushing bills through, no one can talk forever, the most anyone was ever able to delay a vote with it was less than a week. There is no 60 vote threshold for anything. This is how it was until 2010 when McConnell got rid if it under Obama.
The GOP already got rid of this tradition when they were in power. The Democrats need to at least match the power grabbing. It’s not like the GOP is going to honor it when they are in power.
Republicans when Democrats are in power: You need to honor traditions We must have Bipartisanship at all costs.
Democrats: its more important that the rules are preserved, so things are done the "right" way. Yes, we could get rid of Blue slips and put judges into the circuit courts, but Republicans might be angry at us, and we don't want that.
Republicans when they are in power: Fuck you... who cares if the State Bar says they are unqualified!
