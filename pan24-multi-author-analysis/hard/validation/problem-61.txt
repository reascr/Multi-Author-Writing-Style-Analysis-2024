Bannon’s refusal to fully pay his bills has stunned some of his close advisers who’ve stuck around for years.
Then again, Bannon is also a known grifter and liar with a long history of peddling disinformation.
According to sources, Bannon owes “significant” sums of money to attorneys M. Evan Corcoran of Baltimore and Robert Costello of New York City. They—along with David Schoen of Montgomery, Alabama—spent months battling the Department of Justice in 2021 and 2022, and they represented him at a trial in Washinon, D.C., last summer when he was eventually convicted of contempt of Congress.
Steve Bannon—the nativist American media personality who’s backed by a Chinese billionaire—hasn’t paid the lawyers who spent years defending him against an onslaught of criminal charges, according to three sources who spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast.
