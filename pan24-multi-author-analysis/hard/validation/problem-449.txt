None of the things you listed were unconstitutional or illegal. Even Citizens United is a well reasoned decision that was a natural extension of our first amendment precedent/expansion. Your disagreement doesn’t make it different. The dissent is well reasoned as well. Law isn’t a hard science with only one correct result.
That doesn’t specifically grant this right. Congress actually passed a bill SPECIFICALLY for PPP at the time. Lawyers on Reddit must have nightmares reading through these comments.
Well, luckily, that will be decided by the courts and not a bunch of redditors wanting out of their debt they signed up for in order to get a foray into higher education.
Student loan forgiveness was an action by the executive branch. Student loan forgiveness was not voted on in congress. I am aware you think the HEROES Act gives them that authority. I hope you don’t get your hopes too high, for your sake. Anyway, God bless and have a great rest of your week.
He certainly has an opinion. Here’s the opinion of third in command, House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. “People think that the President of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress”.
An act of Congress already approved this. Providing assistance to borrowers after disasters was literally what the HEROES act of 2003 was written for.
Student loan debt forgiveness is being argued under the HEROES Act of 2003. It was unanimous in both Houses, as a post-9/11 response, and was made permanent in 2007. To get the relief, all a borrower has to do is fill out a form confirming that they borrowed money. There’s no requirement to show a degree, no requirement to show a career in the field of said degree. There’s no demonstration necessary that any attempt at repayment was made, and the forgiveness goes out to anyone who made less than $125k individually in 2020 or 2021. You don’t even have to demonstrate that you faced any economic hardship during the pandemic.
