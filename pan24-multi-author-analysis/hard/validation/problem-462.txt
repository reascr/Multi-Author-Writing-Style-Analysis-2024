They haven't, they were just saying how two faced the Republicans are. IF a dem even looks the wrong way the Republicans would do everything they can to ensure they hang, but if Republican tries to commit a coup they just think he's a strong politician.
As they considder that a democrat president always has stolens the election there is no such thing as a non republican president and as such the president can do what he wants /s.
The loud people in this country think a REPUBLICAN President should do whatever he wants without any recourse for asking what was done or why. That’s the message....
Well it’s less that. He has pissed off republicans and their ability to gain elected seats. He is quickly becoming persona non grata and we see that with the Kanye Nick Fuentes stuff from last week.
As soon as he breaches an unknown breaking point, the ENTIRE traditional Republican Party will turn him out and discard him for losing his usefulness. Trump will still have support from the maga crowd, but fortunately they alone are only loud and wholly incapable of governing successfully.
