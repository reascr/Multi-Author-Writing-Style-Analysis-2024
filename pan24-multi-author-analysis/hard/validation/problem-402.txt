Live in Louisville, and I still get people who joke about people not wanting to work due to government hand outs....
I always hit them with the "Would you clean out portapotties for a living if you were paid 100 an hour?".
There is an odd scenario here. The speaker is elected by the house as a whole from candidates nominated by each caucus. The nominees do not have to be from the same party or even a member. So the democrats could nominate some well respected moderate elder statesman. They would then only have to convince a few moderate Rs to vote 'present' since the vote only needs to be of a majority of those present and voting.
If they choose a lunatic without hesitation or they don't reach out for votes, it was absolutely the moderates in both parties and their financiers choice and desired direction for the country.
They only need 6 votes from reasonable Republicans and they have a bi-partisan, lesser-of-two evils majority. Plus it'd give the Republicans no excuse to say "they can't get the votes" in appointing someone like MTG.
Maybe Democrats should just vote in a republican speaker who is not crazy instead of all just voting nay lol . Or vice versa there is nothing stopping a handful of republicans voting in a democrat as a speaker right ?
