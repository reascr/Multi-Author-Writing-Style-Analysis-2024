The problem is that school districts have largely become so sensitive to parent complaints and/or that parents feel so emboldened to harass teachers and administrators such that it becomes impossible for teachers to meaningfully address any sort of controversial topics in their classrooms because the teachers are suddenly put on blast and the school district feels compelled to intervene to put out the fire that conservative activist parents have created.
The article itself is about a deeper problem. Although in very typical NPR fashion they cover it by reciting examples from Side A, then from Side B, then talking to an expert who discusses it in a neutral fashion.
One group of these things is not like the other, but the article definitely points to a problem with experienced teachers being the recipient of politicized complaints.
Knowing teachers, they’re complaining about school board and policy changes as much or more than parents. Ironically it’s the same brainwashed civilians causing both problems.
