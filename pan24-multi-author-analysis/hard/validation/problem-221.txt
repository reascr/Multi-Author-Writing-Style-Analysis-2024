The fact is it was a defensive missile. This is a perfect example of how collateral damage from wars spills over into neighboring countries.
Even if it was a Ukrainian missile that went stray while trying to intercept a Russian attack, the blame is still on Russia. Ukraine didn't kill those two innocent Poles, Russia did.
I get that it means that Russia didn't attack Poland, but it's still their fault those people are dead.
The blame is still on Russia because Ukraine wouldn't have fired those self-defence missiles if they weren't being bombarded.
In the last several hours Zelensky contradicted both Poland and the US and doubled down on his claims. Your theory is in tatters.
However, what concerns me is the disinformation coming out of the Ukrainian government. It's absolutely reckless and callous. They completely misled Poland and the rest of the world. Poland later found out and so instead of blaming Russia they covered their tracks by saying the missiles were Russian "produced". Meanwhile Estonia and Lithuania were practically getting ready to call for arms.
