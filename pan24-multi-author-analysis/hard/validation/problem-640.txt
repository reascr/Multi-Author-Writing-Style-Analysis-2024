If you're gullible and put faith in the reported numbers from Russia then, yeah. It's not as if they're caught lying on a daily basis.
And much in the same way the economic effects of the pandemic hasn't been felt until now Russia won't feel the full effects of their war until next year.
Half of the world treats them like nothing happens, so unless we have world war where we actively tackle India and China together, I'd be rather realistic and knowing that Russia won't be beaten economically anytime soon. Just look how long cold war took before Russia collapsed.
This is why helping Ukraine is so important, Russia is willing to have decade or two of recession just to secure this land for centuries. As a Polish person I realize how much people must suffer to revert it later and how fragile freedom is when you are between two imperialistic powerhouses.
Russia has a lot of gold reserves, it's richest people own big chunk of the world in real estate and stocks and stuff, which is covered by Switzerland and tax havens, plus it sits on biggest reserves of almost all resources available on this planet.
Russians are fine cuz they used reserves to rebuild their currency. Russia can hold cuz its fucking rich, but it costs them a lot and when the war is finished it will only get worse for them, regardless if they win or lose. The longer it goes the worse for an average Russian.
The Russian economy has been hit hard and will suffer even more. But this will not change their behavior.
Spoiler they usually only collapse due to internal political ambitions that highjack the "people". E.g Sudan, Mali, Zimbabwe, Nigeria etc... After decades.
