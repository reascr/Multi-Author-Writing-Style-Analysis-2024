It is deliberate, because it's financially rewarding for them to intentionally murder people and short sell them on power on purpose. Texas is everything the right complains is wrong with government and they keep asking for more of it.
Willfully underbuilding the infrastructure in Texas was very financially rewarding for the utility companies. This belief that companies will act in good faith when the incentive structure is built for just the opposite baffles me.
Progress from mass murder for profit to a reliable grid like a developed nation should already have isn't "progress". That's meeting the bare minimum after a bit of pushback in response to ghoulish levels of capitalism.
There is nothing in the "theory" of capitalism that would prevent this. Capitalism is exploitation.
Does the "theory" of Texas Hold 'Em say that if you have ten chips, and you're playing against someone with one billion chips, you're gonna win that game?
To be genuinely honest, it's actually capitalism working exactly as intended; deception is part of the model. It was literally the answer to the question "if divine right goes out of fashion, are economic exploitation and military violence sufficient to maintain power?".
???? It's not much of a plan to do nothing and let their grid fail though. Biden should sit back, relax and let them deal with the small government they voted for.
