Yep and many people say this is why Russia was so hasty about the war in Ukraine, every 6 months they dont act is another half year of a plummeting population of young people that could fight.
Those Russians fleeing now would of course not want to come back to Russia as long as the war is still ongoing, but people are commenting here as if that was the only scenario possible, thus making the ban of course useless.
This ban threat is aimed at people still living in Russia, to make them think that, in the future, they might regret their decision, even if/when the war ends.
If youâ€™re a neighbor with Russia, you know that the only thing that comes from there is death and war.
These guys then run away from Russia, and go one to terrorize Ukrainian refugees in Europe and former Soviet block countries.
People who flee the country can no longer be used to fight against Ukraine. Reducing the Russian capacity to fight should be the priority right now. Sure, it would be better if they started an uprising but most likely they would just go along with conscription because that's much less dangerous than trying to start a revolt. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.
Then let them pass through to other countries if they're so paranoid about that. It's not like anybody expects say Lativia to take in all the Russian refugees anyways. Germany's expressed a willingness to hear asylum cases from draft dodgers.
And some countries such as Germany and UK are accepting Asylum applications. I agree your view is common but I would not support that course of action.
Ummm yes, it's 3.7% of the total mobilization with several bordering countries restricting Russian entry which is already significant. Without those controls those numbers could skyrocket. Also that demographic is economically valuable to the state as well so it harms the Russians on that end as well.
