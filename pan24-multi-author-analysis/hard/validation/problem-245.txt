my grandfather (bread used to be a quarter) says that he has never seen the prices go down to what they used to be. People see the number % given and since it is going down think inflation is going down. The rate might me slowing compared to last year but even if it was a 0% increase, the prices are still the same. You'd, I guess, need a negative percent to see the prices going down, but that won't happen. As soon as inflation stops rising, they will lower the interest rates.
Very little Biden has done has anything to do with inflation. Likewise, all of the Republicans attacking Biden for inflation and saying that they will somehow magically fix it are idiots.
The Democrats will say we just need to manage the Fallout as best we can while the Republican answer will very much more heavily based on how much control they have.
The progressives have some interesting ideas on fixing inflation with regulations on corporations. But those are realistically unlikely to happen.
I would simply stick to saying those ideas are largely moot because they are not going to happen. Progressives do not even control a majority of the democratic caucus much less a plurality of the house.
