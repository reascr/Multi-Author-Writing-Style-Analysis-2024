Hilarious that this guy might be the reason the Russian mobiks are underequipped. Who knew the weapons he sold off from soviet stockpiles would be badly needed by russian conscripts 30 years later.
I think he was a lieutenant in the Soviet Union before he was caught selling those weapons to countries in Africa. Do we know if the weapons he sold were anything other than Soviet Union's weapons stocks from the Cold War? Aren't the same stock piles being used for the war in Ukraine now?
Or get kickbacks from Ukraine for supplying them weapons through willingly abandoned Russ equipment? He seems more like an equal opportunity player, as shit as the game he plays is, I suspect something like this is being worked out now.
This is true insofar as that his primary contacts were Ukrainian who hated the old USSR and wanted to rid themselves of any association. My guess? He's leveraging those contacts again, but all of them are VERY pro-Ukrainian. He'll have an easier time supplying Ukrainian forces with equipment than Russ forces.
Well now he can help arm those Russian soldiers without proper equipment. Meanwhile we got a tourist back that didn't listen to the US State Department when they said to GTFO.
