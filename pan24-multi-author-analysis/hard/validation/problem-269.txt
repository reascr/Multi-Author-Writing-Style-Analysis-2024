Iâ€™ve found that smaller spaces have had gender neutral bathrooms for a long time because well, they have only 1 bathroom.
I've been to a place with gender neutral bathrooms but one was noted on the outside to have a urinal.
Yeah, there are plenty of gender neutral bathrooms in Russia. His outrage is most likely feigned but if it is not he is very far removed from the life of the average Russian.
Exactly! And gender neutral bathrooms in Sweden are mostly just a practical thing and have nothing to do with trans. There has been a recent movement for making life easier or trans people which have made gender neutral bathrooms slightly more common (and I am certainly not opposed to that), but in most cases it just as to do with efficient use of space.
Maybe that's just my old-man thoughts making a simple situation more complicated but to answer your question - yes I've seen urinals in gender neutral bathrooms.
I've always wondered about everyone who feels unease or claims some sort of psychological trauma regarding gender-neutral bathrooms. Like, do they make each gender use a separate bathroom in their homes? Do they avoid doing anything in the bathroom when their spouse is in the shower or taking a bath? Do they curtain off the toilet to segregate it from everyone else, and if so how is this different than the cubicles in public gender-neutral restrooms?
This sort of defeated the whole purpose as that's definitely now a male-coded bathroom and the other is by extent female.
