I mean, you've seen equal amounts of proof of both sides at this point. You've heard that he's released NSA files that show that the public is being spied upon, and nobody is debating that point. You've now heard that a majority of the millions of documents that he released are focused on military capabilities and operations and not just domestic espionage, and nobody has officially debated this point, either. Yet, because it puts him in a bad light, and despite the fact that we can both doubt that Snowden had personally read through the millions of documents that he has released, you immediately get defensive when you are told that he's not some paragon of light and that he released a bunch of data en masse rather than only releasing what was related.
So Edward Snowden leaks documents explicitly proving that the NSA and military have long documented histories of outright lying to the American public.
But you want me to blindly trust the NSA and military without any actual proof when they say not to trust Snowden?
Snowden could have done what he did without putting the entire intelligence community in danger. Whistleblowing is an important function in a democracy but he handled the information with wild irresponsibility.
