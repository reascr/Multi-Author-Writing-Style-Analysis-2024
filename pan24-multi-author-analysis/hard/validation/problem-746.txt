I might be naive, but I think Orban just doesn't want to think about it. From a political standpoint, it might be a bit of a headache for him and Erdogan is inadvertently covering for him.
Hungary's not going to move unless and until Turkey ratifies. If Turkey rejects, then Hungary will just forget Finland and Sweden ever tried to join NATO in the first place.
Since Finland is located in between Sweden and Russia, as long as Finland joins NATO, that will make Sweden much safer even if Sweden canâ€™t join together.
Finland and Sweden are effectively allied and protected anyway, whether or not they're in NATO. Erdogan could easily decide to re-align himself with russia if he got kicked out.
Regarding Erdogan, he could very well re-align himself with Russia even if not kicked out from NATO.
Russian black sea fleet is at the moment afraid to go out on the open waters against Ukraine, I wonder how they would feel to go up against the navies of Bulgaria and Romania when they have support from aviation of the rest of NATO.
But if we look at it from a complete NATO perspective in a hypothetical conflict with Russia, the baltic Sea is clearly more important considering the were the russian "heartland" is located.
