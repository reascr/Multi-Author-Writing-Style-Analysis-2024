This is the fallacy of thinking you can better figure out how to manage resources than the rest the world working together and making independent decisions on what resources are valuable, what prices should be paid for them and how they are allocated.
Suggesting anyone who recognizes these things is just a victim of lobbying or manipulation is quite ironic â€” because the exact same argument could easily be levelled at anyone who believes capitalism is inherently exploitative and things would be so much better under socialism.
The more you understand the capitalist system beyond the propaganda and indoctrination of the capitalists, the more you understand it is an abomination, just like slavery, feudalism, and apartheid.
People are deliberately miseducated by capitalists, under a capitalist system and social order, in order to produce docile serfs for the ruling class, just as people under slavery and apartheid were deliberately miseducated.
And all of that is the polite version, without even getting into the oligarchy/plutocracy/kleptocracy aspects, the corruption, the colonialism, the deliberate miseducation of the public to produce docile serfs for the ruling class, and so on.
