I like it when people who know stuff explain their stuff to conspiracy theorists. It won't make the conspiracy theorist understand they got fooled, but I enjoy the informative little reads, and it turns a potentially awful comment chain into a suddenly nice read. Thank you.
Thank you very much. If that's really MoD official account they are laughing stock now. No one stores live warheads on the missile airframes. As I said before - they are coming in a form of kits. Mission is confirmed, airframe is prepared, warhead is programmed and installed, bomber is configured for the mission, bomber is generated. That's how it works in UK, US and Russia.
They launched a training version of Kh-55 as a decoy. That's it. Nothing more. Maybe it was at the end of shelf life or something.
There are already articles "interpreting" what MoD had in mind that they just installed the concrete simulator instead of live warhead.
AFAIK nuclear cruise missiles like that are usually stored without the live warhead, and there's a dummy installed for training etc. Only ICBMs and other missiles intended for immediate response to a nuclear attack are constantly armed.
