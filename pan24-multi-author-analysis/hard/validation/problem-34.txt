I mean, if she said it, it is probably true. I've never seen anything from her that doesn't seem genuine. But I'm also not a kiwi and haven't really been paying that close attention to NZ.
NZ is a relative backwater in the middle of nowhere (relative to the West), that's why NZ issues barely make news in the West. The only reason we hear about NZ news is because we share a common language, otherwise it gets dumped into the ignore category/major news only like we have for Japan/China/India.
That said, if you think it is bad in the Netherlands, it's worse in NZ. I know everywhere has issues thanks to a decade of historically low interest rates and an unwillingness to build, but at least the houses you can't afford in the Netherlands are high quality whereas in NZ you are paying even more for damp houses that are falling apart.
It’s indisputable that our housing quality (for a supposedly wealthy country) is very poor, and looking at different metrics of housing affordability compared to other counties we’re paying much more (as vulcanstrike said, relative to our incomes).
Well it’s not like we can just leave the gangs to it, if crime is increasing and law enforcement isn’t proportionately increasing then we’ll become increasingly lawless.
