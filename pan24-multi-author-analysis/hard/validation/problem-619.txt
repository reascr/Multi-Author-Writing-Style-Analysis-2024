The Arizona GOP just emphasizes the fact that the GOP are a bunch of radical losers that are so extreme voters (the ones that matter) are no longer aligning with them.
TLDR; Republicans are maga-republicans now and the republican brand is toxic in a state as diverse as AZ.
The problem is that the Republican party is done with keeping the quiet part quiet. The republican base is who votes in the primaries and they are choosing maga-republicans because that’s what the Republican party has become.
I’ve lived in AZ for 40 years and this is my theory. I believe that AZ is not a purple state, but a red leaning state. I base this on the high Mormon & Hispanic populations here. Maricopa County is very suburban and somewhat diverse. It’s very hard to live here without having at least one POC or LGBTQ person in your neighborhood, school, or office. As such we have a polite suburban culture. You can have all of the bigoted feelings you want, but open, unapologetic bigotry is a no-go. Arizonans need the quiet part to stay quiet or else that nice black family my kid hangs out with are going to associate Me with bigotry. AZ’s culture calls for a John McCain type - shitty conservative policies, no open bigotry.
