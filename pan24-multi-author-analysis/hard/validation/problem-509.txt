I mean, it's more a poem or proverb than it is a series of independent sentences. Which means the meter, rhythm, is also important. Adding the extra word disrupts the 'flow' of the proverb, right at the end.
Each line has 9 words, adding the extra word only adds clarity if you don't take the work as a whole, and the only sentences someone is likely to use independently are the first and last sentences, referencing the whole.
Is it the best, most clear sentence? No. Is it easy to interpret? Yes. Does the meter work better as written? Yes.
I do agree. To dissolve a government that has thousands of nucelar weapons would lead to absolute chaos. Russia doesnt need to be destroyed, it needs a whole new government free of the KGB era.
It's been done before, which is why the Soviet Union doesn't exist any more. I think it's just a matter of finishing the job that was started with the USSR, and if Ukraine proves it can defend itself and win against Russia even after giving away its nukes it will make the argument more persuasive to get the remains of the Russian Federation to make similar agreements towards moving away from nuclear armageddon.
I do not in any way believe that Putin can be persuaded in rational dialogue, not at all - what I’m saying is that ignoring the fact that mutually assured nuclear destruction still holds (because it is unpleasant and deeply offensive to any sense of justice that Russia cannot be stopped by force without risking the end of mankind) is the fastest way to a swift death for the lucky ones among us and unspeakable suffering before a drawn-out painful death for the rest, and thus not a course that any rational person could possibly argue for.
Whether everything that happens is Putin’s fault or not - saying “oh well, we might all die, but it’ll be Putin’s fault so that’s okay then” is a similar statement that no rational person would agree with, and comments like this should make it very clear to any rational observer of the conversations on here that a certain part of the comments on this forum are being made in bad faith and not in the true interest of a rational dialog.
How do 21 active B-2 and a small fleet of B-21 bombers that won’t be active until 2027 in any way entirely negate an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons spread across Russia’s nuclear triad in hundreds of locations including submarines, bombers spread over different airfields thousands of miles apart, mobile launchers spread over a whole continent, etc.? The whole point of mutually assured destruction (which is in force today just as it has been for over half a century) is that even if Russia’s conventional military strenh is tiny compared to that of NATO, there is no way that Russia could be destroyed or overpowered that would not spell pretty much the immediate end of mankind, that part had not changed, and that is precisely why Putin embarked on this war in the first place - he knows there is no way he could lose completely that would not mean the end of the world, and he is betting on this very fact.
Suggesting that it is in any way possible to take out Russia’s nuclear capabilities without an overwhelming risk of global nuclear annihilation is at best incredibly ill-informed and naive, and at worst a downright malicious lie in the attempt to derail the conversation. It is not possible without a huge and entirely irrational risk, if it were it already had been tried and/or achieved, and the complexity of the current geopolitical situation is due to a very large extent precisely the fact that it is not possible.
