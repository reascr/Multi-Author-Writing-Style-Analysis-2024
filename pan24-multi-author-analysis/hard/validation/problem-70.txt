Somebody who grew up in a different culture will have all aspects of their life colored by the culture they grew up in. What they eat, how they communicate, what religion they follow, etc.
That doesn't mean they don't deserve respect or that their views are less valuable. But those differences are there, and a truly multicultural community will embrace and learn from those differences.
I agree people should integrate, learn the language, live by the rules of your home country but not be forced to forgo your own culture holistically for the sake of “fitting in”.
Plus, I do think some culture aspects need to be dropped to actually integrate into a foreign culture If they’re incompatible, Sharia law has no place in Europe for example.
I expect people to learn the language, socialize outside of their homogenous groups and accept local laws and ethics. Locals don’t need to do shit, it’s immigrants who need to be active.
This may be precisely the point if that’s your interpretation. Instead of assuming what I meant you could’ve just asked, though - but why bother.
