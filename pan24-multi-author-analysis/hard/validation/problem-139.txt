Remember that time they crashed a plane into a US spy plane, then ransomed off the crew while dismantling what was left of the plane?
Remember when the chinese air force crashed into a US navy plane, forcing an emergency landing and china seized the aircraft and detained and interrogated the crew for ten days?
Remember in 2001 when China flew a J-8 into an American AWACS, forcing it to land in China, and then when America said hey, give our plane back, we instead watched from surveillance satellites how the Chinese dismantled the plane, and then sent it back to us in pieces when they were done, and then they copied the whole damn thing for their air force..?
Of course China wants chips. Russia wants chips. Everyone does. No one goes it alone, right now. No one can today. The US is bringing more chip fab back home, but those projects are a decade out, and all it's going to do is make us more internationally shock resistant, not independent. If China and Russia want to do it alone... They just... can't... Both countries demographics are inverted pyramids - they have more older people than younger people. Russia has a population of 143 million, but only 8.4 million between 20-40, and Putin has pledged to send up to 2 million of those to die in a war. There isn't going to be a Russia in 10 years. China isn't faring much better, by 2050 their population is going to reduce by HALF. There isn't going to a China anymore. They don't have enough people left, neither of them, to innovate, because they don't have enough people left to hold their own shit together in the first place.
Nothing about China is what the propaganda would lead you to believe. They're not an economic powerhouse because they're entirely dependent. Their economy only exists by the good graces of the US IN THE FIRST PLACE. China is an empire over conquered regions, they were never unified until recent history. The China you know today has only existed for 70 years, though as they tell it, they've always been this singularly large country.
China, industrializing as hard and fast as they could; in Xi Jinping's mind, a world where he cannot possibly imagine deglobalization, his world which we made on purpose, why make what you can buy? It's cheaper and easier that way. China does participate in chip fab, but all of it is imported, the tech, the materials, the knowledge, the software, the people. Because of Biden's CHIPS act, all of that is gone. And with that, all their supposed innovating that they were doing on high speed rail, for example, all their research, and principally because they decided to build hypersonic missiles so they could target the US if they had to, everything China has ever done to innovate is going to die along with their inability to get anything. They're sanctioned, and now they can't get the software from the US, they can't get the hardware from anywhere else, and the people they relied on were all US - so Biden said to those people, either give up your jobs, or give up your US citizenship.
