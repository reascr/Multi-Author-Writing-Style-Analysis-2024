Pinning this comment to address people's questions and worry around article 5 being invoked in light of the 2 killed in the Polish border town.
(The information below is no longer pertinent in light of what NATO's assessment of the situation has been.).
Initial findings suggest that the missile that hit Poland was fired by Ukrainian forces at an incoming Russian missile, Associated Press reported on Wednesday, citing U.S. officials.
Polish Foreign Ministry confirm a Russian-made (important wording, they're not saying Russia necessarily was the one that sent it) rocket fell on the territory.
NATO will probably respond by moving artillery within striking distance of Russia in neighbouring countries, but juuuust outside of the range of Russian equipment that's being used in Ukraine.
Uh Russia, might wanna put a tighter leash on your artillerymen, this could turn into an international incident faster than a flash fire, and my gut says you don't wanna fuck around with a country that's been preparing for another invasion since WW2.
Rhetoric like this is a double-edged sword - on the one hand, it might have some degree of deterring aggression from Russia; on the other hand, NATO would surely look like cowards if they did nothing after saying something like this.
