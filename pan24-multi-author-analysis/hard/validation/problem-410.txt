If you plug in your car in WV, WY, KY, MO, NE, ND, UT or MT, it's more than likely that it's powered by coal. (those are the states that have 50+% energy production from coal).
Yeah, found a 538 article about it, and yup, it was brietbart's very own John Nonsense Nolte. Edited my comment to add the link (bonus because the link isn't actually to the original and thus denying them those clicks they want).
"A few weeks ago, Breitbart News — the right-wing, hyperpartisan news site formerly run by Steve Bannon — published a truly galaxy brain column. Editor-at-large John Nolte argued that Democrats have been promoting the COVID-19 vaccine not to save lives but instead to trick Republican voters into not getting the jab. Nolte’s theory concluded that this, in turn, would lead to unvaccinated Republicans getting sick and dying from COVID-19, ultimately helping Democrats electorally.".
That has nothing to do with it though. Their production of oil isn't going to be affected by whatever changes they can make to their miniscule consumption of oil.
They do not care. They are all about performative politics. It doesn't matter what they actually achieve, it matters what message they are sending.
