Frankly, I prefer the parliamentary approach of the party selecting the executive nominee. We (the US) place way too much emphasis on selecting the executive who has relatively little power in our government.
I didn’t call it a stronghold. There is a big difference between having a foothold - somewhere that they’ve established some level of influence- and a stronghold. There is no progressive foothold in SC. I said Biden wants to start somewhere he (or his chosen successor, probably Harris) will win.
But you are right it's probably about the payback and, since Biden will likely run unopposed, mostly for show.
Ahs besides even if Trump ran independent that's still no reason for Biden to run again. Biden has been privatizing Medicare, siding against unions and paid sick leave, and raising inflation through massive increases in medicare premiums instead of using March in rights to lower prescription drug costs.
Biden not only failed to expand public insurance, he is privatizing Medicare and raising premiums massively as we speak.
