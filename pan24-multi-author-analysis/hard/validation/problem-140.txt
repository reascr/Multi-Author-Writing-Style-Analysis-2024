It's literally what nazis did, as time goes on they keep making the "us" group narrower. Now Israel's new (even more) far right government is straight up saying if you're not Orthodox you're not Jewish enough.
If you tell any right-winged Israeli about how similar their behavior is to countries like Iran, they'll always retort with the same "this is a Jewish country for Jews, if you don't like it you can move".
That means that if every non-religious Israeli took the advice of "just pack up and leave if you're unhappy" the country would quite literally economically collapse.
Which is ironic because, on average, the non-religious Israeli pays 6 times as many taxes as the orthodox one, essentially bankrolling their child support and the paycheck they receive from the government to study the Bible.
If you want to not pay taxes / social security, you have to have lived somewhere else for a prolonged period (I believe about 2 years, out of which 183 days in every year have to be out of country).
