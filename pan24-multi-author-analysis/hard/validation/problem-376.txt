Honestly, the absolute defense of German foreign policy incompetence is rivaling the most hardcore of brexiteer.
That's either willful blindness or unchecked arrogance, and given the overall sentiment from German posters, I'd have to say its arrogance.
I mean, Germany was so caught off guard their head of intelligence was caught in Ukraine when the war broke out despite US warnings.
I was referring to Germany blocking a country sending weapons to Ukraine while the UK was flying in thousands of weapons (while oddly avoiding all German airspace).
Don't forget the beginning of the war when people predicted Germany would never suspend NordStream 2 nor even give anything above helmets and body armour to Ukraine.
And when it wasn't, that Germany would try to pressure Ukraine economically to accept loss of territory to achieve piece.
Don't get me wrong, I am ready and willing to criticise Germany and Schultz for lack of leadership and pussying around when it comes to supporting Ukraine, but doesn't some of this argument make sense?
