Does that mean the federal government gets to be involved? Because I think I remember Florida itself has a no extradition clause within its own state, but idk if that overrides international requests?
Brazil would be notifying the US that they would like their citizen back, assuming quickly that what I read was true (not sure if it is,just using the assumption to clarify).
And the US and Brazil have a treaty in place to make it happen if he's ever charged with a crime that the US also considers a crime.
Well I don’t want to extradite him (yet) because he’s not charged in Brazil so it wouldn’t be extraditing in the first place.
If Steve Bannon was behind the attempted Brazilian Coup, maybe he should be extradited to stand trial in Brazil.
Has Brazil actually asked for him to be extradited? Does the US have an extradition treaty with Brazil?
Brazil and the US have an extradition treaty, which means that as soon as someone is judged guilty in one country, the other is obligated to comply. The only possibility for the US to deny an extradition inquiry from Brazil is that if there’s a justifiable suspicion of human rights violations (for example, if the criminal is sentenced to death, the other country shouldn’t expatriate him).
