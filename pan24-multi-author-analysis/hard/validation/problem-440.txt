Since this was declared a victory, their first advance in a while, I guess this throwing 500 bodies a day tactic will continue.
Throw in the Wagner vs Russian army disputes which results in an apparent lack of Russian army artillery cover/counter artillery for Wagner troops and it gets worse.
It’s seems the small town of soledar was taken by sending bodies at Ukraine’s defences until a weak point was found. This lost a lot of untrained troops, but Russia has got their bodies into Soledar and declared a victory. The Russians there are under drone surveillance and artillery fire, so it’s still a dangerous place to be.
And you have the Russian military trying to build a strategy knowing any of those things is going to hit them really hard.
Our soldiers have the knowledge & experience to master all NATO-style weapons and push russian occupiers from our land. I highly value our cooperation with NATO & Iceland!".
Yeah. The Ukrainian public is not happy about the pretending to be civil, legal (ie arrest) then simply murder on the street soon after, which is obviously not justice, and not even permitted in war. They want to know if SBU has been doing this, and how often, and how many times basically got it wrong.
