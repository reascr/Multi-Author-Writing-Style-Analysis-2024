Oh no.What pisses me off most is the fact that the rainbow has been stolen by gay activists.nothing against gays btw.wearing multi colours now means your lgbtq.why take all the colours,greedy.
All I see is Dave Chappelle still being correct on how the LGBTQ community gets more done for whites than for gays. It's more white privilege nowadays than it is about true Inclusivity. That's why we're voting on articles about priviliged whites feeling that they let migrants die in the thousands for their hats to be the most accepted article of discussion. Oh the poor rainbow hats on those alive walking over the dead and in front of the workers never paid. Oh woe is the privileged Oh sob Oh decry this unwavering sense of oppression on my rights...only now when I am on vacation I can afford over the serfs. Next week we want to see Notre Dame, The Vatican, and all the sundown towns slave towers where Blacks and Indigenous were sold in America...then they cry over us choosing to remove our oppression. Europeans are the worst.
