I'm convinced people who argue for gas stoves can't or don't cook and instead want something to complain about.
Slower than my electric, can't hold an accurate oven temp for shit, let's enormous amounts of waste heat into the room, and is an absolute nightmate to clean.
Old electric stoves sucked, but the new ones behave much more like gas than like the old electric ones.
I would much rather have a gas cooktop than electric. The heating is easier to control and reacts faster to changes. Thereâ€™s a reason why most professional kitchens use gas cooktops.
I use gas in my kitchen. You can pry the gas from my kitchen from my cold dead hands. I don't think banning these is the right way, because, you know, "freedom". But if you were to offer significant stimulus options to make non-gas alternatives far cheaper, I'd also consider it.
Youre not wrong, but Im not convinced that banning gas will do much. Corporations have spent decades spending money to make consumers think their home use is a major contributor when corporations still vastly outpace home use.
