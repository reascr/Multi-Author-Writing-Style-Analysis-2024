Yesterday US Senators. Lindsey Graham, Richard Blumenthal & Sheldon Whitehouse met President Zelensky in Ukraine. Graham said: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ military needs tanks. I am tired of the s show surrounding who is going to send tanks & when are they going to send them.
Nearly a year later they can't control stolen territory (18%) as Ukraine starts getting the good shit lol.
NATO is now starting to deliver Ukraine the good shit, wait until it's in the field and Russia will get trounced.
the idea is that Ukraine gets those tanks before that and they can push the russian out before the russians army gets ready for the spring.
The key here is Ukraine can start training on German Tanksâ€¦which means a path to a deal is achievable and Germany at the moment is playing up the plausible deniabilityâ€¦.
>Ukraine has agreed with Germany to train our tank crews on German Leopard 2 tanks, although no decision has been made on whether to provide them, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said.
âš¡ Ukrainian tankers will start training on Leopard 2 tanks, says Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.
"Ukraine had agreed with some countries that owned Leopard 2 tanks to train Ukrainian crews before Germany decided to transfer them.".
