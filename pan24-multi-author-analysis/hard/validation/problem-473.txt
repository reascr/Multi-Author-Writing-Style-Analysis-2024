Again the people that died from the terrorist blast didn't do any of this or had anything to do with this. You need to separate the government from the victims of this atrocity. Turkey has a lot of shit to answer for and they should but has nothing to do with this terrorist activity, just ask any Armenian.
That being said i would like to know how accurate the evidence is against whatever group the government is pinning this on. Could this be from the putin Chechen playbook? If it is really the PKK or just trying to drive support to eradicate the kurds. If this is really the PKK then f them.
No, this is wrong thinking terrorists attacks against civilians is terrible and the people responsible should be tried and punished as severally as possible. This is indiscriminate killings of people and an eye for an eye is barbaric and makes whatever political statement moot. I am sorry that innocent people died living their lives.
Killing of innocents is killing of innocents. It seems they're only terrorists when standing up to the wrong people though. Hence all the US civillian support for the IRA up until they had their own terror attack to deal with.
