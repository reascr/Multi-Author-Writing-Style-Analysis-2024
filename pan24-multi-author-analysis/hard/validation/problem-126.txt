And most of their General KMTs general did not follow orders. -Japan war. I highly doubt China can defend Shanghai and Nanjing. Their troop lack training, equipment, and supply. Some of their troops only carry swords. Western countries refuse to train and equipped the KMT army.
Not even the KMT wants to join the PRC. 80-85% just want things to stay the way they are - unlike the DPP and their Western infiltrators and puppet masters who will do anything in their power to provoke the PRC.
Obviously when the Taiwanese people you "love" so much vote in way you don't like, you stop "loving" them and decide its time for a coup .
You, like 90% of redditors, don't have a fucking clue what you're talking about when it comes to Taiwan.
This is somewhat misleading, you can't speak for entire "Taiwanese" and present a biased picture. Most Taiwanese don't speak English, they speak mandarin Chinese. That alone shows the intrinsic bias of our reporting of what is happening there.
This is why you don't trust anecdotes from random redditors with an implicit bias. From (one of the most pro TW biased news websites out there). These were the guys who misrepresented China's COVID numbers by up to 100 times and were called out on it.
So only half the population supported independence during Nancy Pelosi fiasco on a poll from an incredibly biased source (Taiwan Foundation for Democracy). My guess is in an actual vote they would lose. PRC is Taiwan's largest trading partner (about 40-50%), they are hyper aware of this fact.
