Honestly? Let them destroy the economy. They have yet to face any consequences for their shit cause dems keep bailing them out. It's not Democrats responsibility to stop these psychos. They're in charge in January. Force them to govern.
Force them to govern? These people don't believe in governing beyond tax breaks for rich people, so good luck with that.
But perhaps I'm naive, but I don't know if there is as much desire now to further cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy. Meaning less desire to cut the budget now. You've got corporations who may actually want the government to stimulate the economy instead of strangle it this time.
Republicans have a lot of campaign donors that don't want to see a repeat of 2011. Medicare lowering their payments to providers would directly hurt insurance and hospitals and I don't see Republicans wanting to upset them. Major defense contractors are in the same boat.
I suppose Republicans will have to weigh if pissing off some lobbyists is worth it in order to tank the economy and give them a better chance of taking back power. They did that last time probably because they had enough billionaires who wanted those savings from cutting the budget under Obama to go towards tax cuts for corporations.
