So uh...yeah I wouldn't say it's ridiculous to call it a failed state lol. Beautiful country, good people, but it is a failed state. At best, a failing state.
I wouldn’t say it’s a failed state. Those headlines aren’t common, narco violence is localized on some hot spots around the country. The news make Mexico seem like it’s in a perpetual state of war but there’s millions and millions of people who will never encounter any direct issue with any cartel other than getting offered drugs at clubs.
The question here is what exactly constitutes a failed state. No one is saying Mexico doesn't have a huge issue with organized crime, but to me cities like Mérida, Mexico City, Monterrey, Puebla, Querétaro, Guadalajara, etc. could simply not exist in a failed state.
I think the distinction that matters here is the failed state vs failing state. Haiti at the moment would be an example of a failed state. Chaos is rampant in Haiti and there's no working government to deal with the issues. A failed state like that is an urgent very urgent crisis and mexico hasn't quite gotten there yet.
