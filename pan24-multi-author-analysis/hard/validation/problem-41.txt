Hey you getting invaded by your neighbour, the one that promised to never attack you. And NATO persuaded you to give up your nukes for and in return protect you. Whose military are committing atrocities to your civilian populations. You shouldn’t use some of your weapons against them. Because you promised.
I get why you might think that, but mines are at a different level. What is really the difference between a mine and a bomb/artillery shell? Especially in this conflict. The idea is that mines don’t discriminate between civilians and military, well Russia is deliberately firing rockets/shells at civilians. And the civilians that have to deal with the Ukrainien mines are also Ukrainien.
During that summer rain of that "petal mines" fell several times over Donetsk. In the residential areas of the city, that is not controlled by Ukraine since 2014. What were they trying to prevent there that hasn't happened in past 8 years?
And now, after Ukraine regain control over Izum, which is 150 kilometers away from Donetsk, the HRW says that "During the Russian occupation of Izyum, the Ukrainian military appears to have used landmines in nine areas around Izyum".
That is not a mines that tank would care at all. Even if you drive a car into it, the mine will just damage your wheel at maximum. They are talking about special shells for the artillery, that explode in the air and randomly saw large areas by anti-personnel landmines.
BTW these landmines are anti-personnel, not anti-tank. They're "delivered" by artillery and then fly randomly covering a large area.
