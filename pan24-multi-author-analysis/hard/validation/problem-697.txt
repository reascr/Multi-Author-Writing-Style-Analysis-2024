Also, "the West" is not a single person to hold accountable. As far as I know, no one here destabilized any Latin American country, so it isn't hipocritical for anyone to criticize Russia here.
No, US intervention in foreign countries is not ok. But when you see an article about someone being murdered, you do not answer with "well what about this other murder that happened the other day, was that okay???".
Whataboutism is not a valid argument. Also, there are multiple independent left-wing south american nations right now. Please name a eastern european country russia hasn't tried to destabilize.
That is a classic propaganda technique used by the Russians and you shouldn't fall for it nor employ it.
That, and your follow-on response, are the hallmarks of Whataboutism, a well-known Russian propaganda tactic, comrade.
This also reeks of Putinism, because it implies that the USA is always choosing new enemies...at the very time when it is little Vladolf Shitler (you know the OP topic) who invaded a peaceful sovereign nation (AGAIN) after violating a decades old peace accord, installing his own puppet as president, and trying to launch an internal civil war with his own planted stooges in Eastern Ukraine.
