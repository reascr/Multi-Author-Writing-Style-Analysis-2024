I thought everyone was anti-slavery these days (in the first world). I don’t see anyone campaigning on bringing it back in, for example. I guess to call it a conservative position is potentially disingenuous, but I’m open to being explained why I am wrong.
Totally understand, I wasn’t trying to say anyone was wrong at all, I just didn’t see anyone publicly advocating slavery (but I definitely see what people are saying about it having evolved into something more systemic and insidious). Cheers!
I was hoping for an explanation, never asked for it to be succinct. But thanks for the short version, still helpful. I guess I just thought slavery wasn't anyone position these days, but maybe some secretly want it back (would make sense).
Sorry wasn’t trying to be rude, but there is a clear and visible correlation between the history of slavery, and Institutionalized racism. in our current climate it’s a vein that conservatives have tapped into to garner support.
Instead of using recourses to improve communities, we spend resources on imprisoning people for free labor aka slavery and guess what, the majority are black.
We still have slavery, it’s just hidden behind a corrupt system that systematically targets minorities and marginalized groups.
