Additionally, the chamber would consider preventing non-emergency drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a tool the Biden administration has regularly used amid rising gas prices in recent months. Gas prices are Bidens fault He should do something and No We won't let him do anything to bring those prices down again.
