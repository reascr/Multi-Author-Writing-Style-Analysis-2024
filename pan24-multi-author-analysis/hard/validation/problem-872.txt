Would you accept the results if the Supreme Court intervenes and allows elections to be decided by gerrymandered state legislatures that donâ€™t represent a majority of voters?
Again, I don't care if they SAY they don't want democracy gone if they then go and vote for the party that has been trying to enact a coup and restrict voting rights and remove legitimate mail-in ballots and passing state-level laws to override the popular vote for presidential electors.
Lots of things. The biggest is probably a network of allied media outlets that mirror what Republicans have with Fox / Breitbart / Sinclair Media / Every single talk radio station in the country. The GOP doesn't directly fund this of course but they are supported by an activist base, and the Democrat activist base is currently too individualistic and needs to unite around creating broadcast institutions of all sizes.
Yes, but they aren't doing that. If you vote for a less extreme candidate in the primary but cast a vote for the extreme one anyways in the general, you're contributing to steering it towards extremism.
You want moderate Republicans voting to help steer it away from extremism. You want the Democrats to be more palatable to moderates. If those two things could be accomplished the country would be better off for it.
