The exact date of Mr. Biden's announcement has not been finalized yet, according to the source, who said, "This has always, always been our plan. State of the Union first, candidate later.".
President Joe Biden is likely to announce his bid for reelection "not long after" he delivers his State of the Union address on Feb. 7, a source with knowledge of the ongoing planning confirmed to CBS News.
Basically if Biden runs, he will almost certainly win and if he doesn't, Democrats will almost certainly lose.
Biden is at the center of the Democratic party, politically, and is not personally divisive with his rhetoric. He's about as palatable as they come.
Republican voters actively despise Democrats based on nothing and would likely put forward a conspiracy theorist election denier as their candidate, so there's very little Democrats can do to bridge that gap.
I had a similar perspective before Biden started his term, but he's actually been doing a great job so far. I get that it's popular to hate on the old guys for being too decrepit to function, but it seems pretty clear to me he's up for it and doing what he should be.
