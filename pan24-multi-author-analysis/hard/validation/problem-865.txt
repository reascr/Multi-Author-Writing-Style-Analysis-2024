.So sadly the alternatives are Not-Ubers (Cabify, DiDi)and the bus which isnt feasible at night for its own reasons.
Taxi drivers in LatAm scam and rob people all the time, even locals dont trust them, especially local women.
The reality is unfair, and the reality is that millions have no choice but to scrape by for minimal wages as drivers or deliverypeople to survive, and this will happen whether or not foreigners tip.
So I talk to a lot of drivers, the vast majority of them claim you can earn about 1800 dollars a month (again, on my specific city, can’t say that this is the reality of the rest of the state, much less the entirety of Brazil). That 1800 can be broken down to about 1000 to 1200 dollars being the cost of car maintenance and such, and between 800 to 600 dollars to the driver, they work something like 10 hours a day, Monday to Saturday.
Here’s my 2 cents on this, I live in the south of Brazil, sold my car long time ago and use Uber exclusively for transport (with all the taxes, insurance, gas costs, Uber is actually cheaper than having a car for work commute).
