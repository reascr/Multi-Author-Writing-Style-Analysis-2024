Sort of sure it took me a minute to see it and that's with everyone saying that the crossword having one in it. I mean they could have made it look a lot more like one if that was the intention.
He has been using calling people anti-Semitic when they criticize him or Israel for years now. So at this point I would argue that he almost doesn't have to say it to say it.
I'm not going to argue about this. You will believe what you believe. I choose to look at the data and the facts, and base my belief on it. Long live the people of Israel. All of them. May a path of peace be found, and healing slowly come to those who have been wronged by the perversion of a noble idea.
I have been to Auschwitz and Dachau. I am deeply invested in the history and plight of the tribes, and the modern Jewish people. The way you presented your interpretation of Zionism, however, is a perfect example of how a bias has been engendered into its discussion that makes it difficult to talk about the exploitations, violence and oppression that Zionism empowered under corrupt Israeli officials. And to say the Zionism is "literally just" one thing, the hope for a homeland, you are either unaware of choosing willful ignorance because of your bias.
Seem your problem is not with the ethnostate part but with the Jewish part , I don't see you condem the actual ethnostates in the middle east just the Jewish country.
Maybe don't refer to the one Jewish nation as "demonic," considering the historical tropes of Jews as inherently evil/having horns/being the "synagogue of Satan.".
Yeah it was such a privilege to be genocided, made to be second-class citizens, and kept out of educational institutions with Jew quotas. What a privilege /s.
