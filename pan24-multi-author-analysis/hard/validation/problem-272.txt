It is effectively mandatory though. If you are in an active border conflict and join NATO then you can invoke article 5, leaving NATO in a horrible spot where they have to choose between getting involved in a preexisting conflict that didn't involve NATO at all, or to show the world and all member states that it doesn't take article 5 seriously.
But all of this may mean nothing because if it's determined that NATO without Ukraine is going to inevitably trigger Article 5 in the future because it didn't help Ukraine today.
if at some point Ukraine will be able to join NATO, that would only happen after Russia's complete defeat , which will never happen (nukes being one of the reasons). And if it were to happen , what is the point to join NATO?
I guess it could help with negotiations, but at this point the way Ukraine gets into NATO is WW3 starting.
Also, if anyone thinks negotiating with Russia will never happen, there is only 4 ways the war ends.
I would bet every cent I have that 3 is the most likely although I am willing to admit 2 and 4 could happen.
