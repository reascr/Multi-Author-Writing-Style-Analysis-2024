It’s funny because if you call say bmw or Volkswagen or any modern vehicle a car than calling this piece of shit a car as well is like comparing wright brothers early machine to let’s say F16. It’s not even the same scale, like that moskvich dump will potentially have zero safety features, I would be surprised if seatbelts are present. In terms of traction control systems again zero, engine will probably be shared with some tractors they still produce, bodywork will start rusting on the production line… Russians have no access to western technology, whatever they can copy or steal they will use but it’s still going to be a total disaster. It’s still funny to watch because it’s amazing how fucked up putin regime is and Russians still don’t seem to protest. Like the standards of living over there are plummeting but they still have fun, I guess Russians are really different breed altogether.
Of course, if things deteriorate enough, Russian citizens have a history of being quite “energetic” in their demands for change.
If anyone wonders why Russian citizens of today are so tolerant of Putin, perhaps the film series will help to explain why.
The Russian people have a living memory of profound collapse and chaos. Incredible deprivation, crime, hunger, etc. People will tolerate an awful lot if they can eat and otherwise live in relative security.
