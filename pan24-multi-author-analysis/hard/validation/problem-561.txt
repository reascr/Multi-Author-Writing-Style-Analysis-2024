By literally disregarding any understanding of legal standing. A 1L from a half-decent program could explain why none of the plaintiffs should be able to present a case.
I want to believe this, but they also don't feel bound in any meaningful way by precedent. They could allow this argument to pass muster (despite it having been knocked down in a taxpayer context already), then just refuse to hear cases that carry the argument to its logical endpoint.
It's harder to argue (the already weak argument) that you were arbitrarily excluded on that distiction, and it feels much closer to a "general greivance"/taxpayer standing which has been excluded.
And the arbitrary exclusion part comes from Biden initally saying FFEL loans would be eligible and then, when some of those lenders sued, they overnight without any notice announced FFEL loans are ineligble to avoid standing from those lenders. It's hard to argue that decision is not arbitrary considering the only motivation was to avoid a plaintiff having standing. Especially in the context of administrative procedure where you kind of have a presumption of arbitrariness if you don't go through the proper notice and comment process (which did not happen here for the initial forgiveness or for the overnight exclusion of FFEL loans).
The plaintiffs argued that they should have had an opportunity to comment on the proposed loan forgiveness prior to it being implemented as required under the Administrative Procedure Act.
