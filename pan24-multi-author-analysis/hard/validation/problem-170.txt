Well, I see what you're saying and I don't disagree. But I also don't think that's what I'm doing. I've read them all as well as their contemporary Shoepenhauer, I've also read some eastern philosophy and was a history major and can say I think the "But the Nazi's co-opted Neitzche" is the revisionist / apologist position. All the 19th century German philosophers were upper class elitists, that's the perspective they came from and that's what the Nazi's were looking for when they went shopping for validation. From Neitzche to Nazi was an evolution, not a theft.
Neitzche, Jung, Freud all did it, and it's part of the reason I think their ideas / philosophies are garbage. Modern right wing thinkers like Nick Land also promote the idea.
Basically get themselves to a point of breakdown from sleep deprivation in order to have "Revelations.".
Sure. But making broad statements isn't very conclusive of anything. I'm not saying that drugs or taking your body to the extremes is a recipe for enlightenment, but in the same breath I don't want to stop people exploring ideas and taking things further. Nor do I wish to encourage people to not step out of their comfort zones and echo chambers. Afterall none of us know anything about consciousness or our environment.
