But we won’t, because then we’d have to admit that our entire governing system is flawed and archaic.
Or we could join the rest of the civilised democratic world and finally get around to making a written constitution. One that includes protective laws for protesting.
Violent protests exist, you know? The Tories aren’t just being evil for the sake of it. People need to try to look at things from different perspectives instead of the mindless Marxist mentality.
You can't ask for people to look at things from different perspectives and call people who have a different perspective than you "mindless marxists". It's not reasonable.
It's good to have a balance of both. However, it definitely needs reform and getting rid of cash for peerage corruption etc. Ideally, it should be made of a cross-section of society, community-minded people and academic experts to be fully representative.
The problem with elected officials is they often only care about popular in that moment, knee-jerk, short-term issues, rather than long-term issues like climate change.
