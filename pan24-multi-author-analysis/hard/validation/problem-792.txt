> The guardianship law has not been abolished, however, and women still need the consent of a man to get married and obtain certain forms of healthcare. Male guardians can also bring legal action against women for ‘disobedience’ and being absent from home.
> A number of legal changes have improved women’s rights in Saudi Arabia in recent years, including the end of a ban on driving and amendments to the oppressive guardianship law that would allow, for the first time, women to apply for official documents such as a passport and to travel abroad independently.
There are still extreme human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia, particularly when it comes to the treatment of migrant workers and the Shia minority, but at least when it comes to women's rights they are on a commendable path. Still a long way to go of course.
People will find a way to be cynical about this. I would say it's a good thing. Saudi is coming from a place of darkness for sure, but there has been real progress for women's rights over the last decade or so.
This is a big thing for Saudi women I hope... there's been some major reforms there lately. It's still an Islamic Monarchy so I'm eager to see how they will follow through as sponsors.
I agree. Changing social norms and public perception takes time and seems they are on the right path. Far from perfect but credits' due for good reforms.
