“While Sanders and King formally caucus with Democrats, Sinema declined to explicitly say that she would do the same. She did note, however, that she expects to keep her committee assignments – a signal that she doesn’t plan to upend the Senate composition, since Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer controls committee rosters for Democrats.”.
This move lets her continue to play "President Sinema", forcing Schumer and Biden to continue to acquiesce to her demands for attention and favorable treatment (like committee chairmanships).
She already had a de facto primary opponent, an anti-Sinema PAC that raising respectable money, and the Arizona Democratic Party had passed a motion of no confidence against her.
But now she doesn't have to fight a primary and has turned the next Arizona Senate election into a three way race, which she thinks will benefit her.
If they don't run anyone against her, she still probably loses to a Republican in 2024 considering how close these AZ races are.
She can't be primaried as an independent, so she would effectively spoil the race for Democrats if they ran someone against her from the left.
