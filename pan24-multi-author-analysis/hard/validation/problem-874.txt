I've always said this about him in general. Just wait till we find out what he did with those classified documents. It will get worse. It always does.
Right. ”And as you know, Sean, we were talking about how people have to take up arms, this is so wrong, big arms, little arms, knives, bats, even those things they use around their fingers to make a fist and POW really punch someone and they are spitting out their teeth—I’ve seen guys lose teeth being hit with those BASS KNUCKLES! Sean, that’s what they are called because they are made out of brass and go on your knuckles.

Hannity: “Mr. President, they are storming the Capitol. Are there any words you have for these people?”.
Trump: “But you did, Sean. Remember I said we should get some call girls and then you were like ‘Let’s get cigars, too’ and then I said, ‘Wouldn’t it be something, Sean, if on January 6th, they burned the Capitol to the ground?” And then you said, ‘Let’s do it’?”.
The big hit if either voting company wins is to force Fox to change or risk more and more similar litigation. Theirs are extreme cases, but if either (or both) win, targets of Fox are going to start using those judgements to attack Fox.
