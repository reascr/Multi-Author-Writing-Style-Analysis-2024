This reminds me of the funniest comment I ever saw on reddit. It was about a meeting between Trump and Putin, and that only the two of them were aware of the contents of the talks.
The stumbling block to that is there's no real common ground for them to have a discussion on with Russia and Ukraine.
Like hell if putin is going to fly to a nato country to negotiate peace, or as if Ukraine will fly to a Russian ally.
The incursion into Ukraine is essentially Russian military going “I’m not touching youuu” to the west.
Insulting in the fact that the Ukraine is basically the doormat here for Russia to knock on Western doors.
Ukraine's demands are basically "Stop invading, leave the places you've taken, go back to Russia." Russia's counter-offer was "No.".
A third party may be able to get past that. At bare minimum, the US might be able to get Russia to understand that we can fund Ukraine's war until the Ukrainians are tired of fighting and they really don't seem to be wearing out. Russia's military capacity is crumbling by the day.
