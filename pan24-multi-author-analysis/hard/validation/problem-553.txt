If enough people lie and cheat there way into congress as Republicans, take committee appointments and then consistently vote liberally, we might have an ethics dept again. And also get shit done.
Republicans want power and don’t care about morals, national security, etc. so fuck them at their own game. Run everyone as a Republican.
Please remember this and run as right wing republicans despite a staunch liberal background and surprise everyone when good laws pass and a democratic speaker is elected.
If you care about the country do it. If republicans don’t care about who you really are then why not lie all the way to office before voting for voting rights, abortion rights, universal healthcare. Show the GOP that lying to get elected can backfire tremendously on them.
The fact that anybody in America can lie to become an elected lawmaker and then hold that position is an absolute contradiction. It shows up the total immoral hypocrisy that has now become the ideology of the Republican party.
