I’ve got a family member who got a felony when he was 18. His legal debt to society was fulfilled decades ago. He got a trade and became very successful in his profession. He’s now a business owner.
You’d think that there should have been a federal lawsuit ages ago to standardize voting for people with felony convictions that have fulfilled their sentences in federal elections. It’s ridiculous states have different election standards and someone can just move to a different state to get their rights back to vote for president.
The constituencies are so different, I don't think the gerrymandered legislature should be able to essentially elect the governor if they can't serve or get removed.
Yep it allows the (gerrymandered) legislature to remove a popularly elected governor and replace him with the (gerrymandered) speaker of the house instead of the popularly elected lieutenant gov.
Thinking about it though, I'm guessing the 2 amendment was so that if TN ever gets another Democratic governor, if the legislature removes him they can replace him with the Speaker instead of the Lt. Governor...
