Sounds like The Lottery Jackpot from The Peripheral. Basically climate change set off a series of natural disasters like plagues, droughts, wars and on and on. One thing leads to another and eventually we’re all fucked.
Yeah we’d all be pretty fucked. Btw I love your username. I just had to put down my 4 year old female, Lucy, last week because of a tumor we didn’t find until it was too late. Her brother, Carlos, has been searching for her everywhere and rubbing his face against blankets she used to cuddle in and it’s breaking my heart.
To be fair, my hospital showed up when it came to pay. We all got raises and they would offer $600-$800 bonuses on top of OT if you picked up a shift. And you weren’t limited on how many shifts you could pick up.
I started my first nursing job out of school one week before the lockdowns began in the US, as an ICU nurse. If this shit jumps to humans, I’m quitting. I’m not going to be thrown into another fucking meat grinder and risk the health of myself or my family. I can’t handle another round of “Hero’s [sic] work here!”, signs in front of the hospital.
