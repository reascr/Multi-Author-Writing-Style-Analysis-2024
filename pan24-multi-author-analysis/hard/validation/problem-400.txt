I’ve cleaned up after a 2x Molotov attack that did minimal damage. Even if they ignite and break it’s not much fuel. Hot tip: break the window first, you want the Molotov to land and hopefully break near something flammable not on the window sill.
Hopefully they will fuck this plan up as badly as all the others but that’s small comfort for those Ukrainians sacrificing everything for their home and countrymen.
They want the Ukrainians to despair, give up, and let Russia keep the land it has stolen (until it’s ready to come back for more).
To people with high levels of military knowledge: Once Ukraine recaptures the west bank of the river in Kherson, what then?
If Ukraine can capture the west bank of the Dnepo (sp?) river, and build a beachhead, they will start moving troops and heavy weapons over immidiatly and try and make a larger pocket to bring over more supplies and troops and equipment. There is risk though, the Russians know they are coming, they may be crazy enough to blow the hydroelectric dam and try and wash away a landing party once enough troops are there, etc. Ukraine on the other hand doesn't have large landing craft to try and attempt a landing on the coast and away from the contested areas, so they don't have alot of geographically feasible options.
I see them keeping a holding force at one or the other front, and trying to sneakily reinforce one or the other long enough to create a decisive force large enough to take a large chunk of territory. I think the more noise they make about an imminent attack is the least likely vector it will come from. A middle of the occupied area push towards Maruipool (sp?) is something I don't think should be ruled out either.
