This seems like the kind of thing the CIA and every US government thinks before inserting themselves into a geopolitical mess halfway around the world and messing it up further lol.
Maybe, but the Galwan valley incident happened in 2020, way before the current Ukraine conflict and Russia's reduced standing. I'm pretty sure they're aware of how hard a Himalayan conflict would be as well, and honestly I still don't even know what the result of the earlier skirmish at Galwan was. According to India they killed more Chinese soldiers while according to the Chinese side they killed more Indians. I'm slightly more inclined to believe India, but it's not as though India's government isn't also pretty nationalist - but at the very least they gave us numbers, unlike the Chinese government refusing to even do that. If what India says is true, I would think the Chinese wouldn't be dumb enough to make an even bigger push on that front now.
China wants to fight India like so bad...from the Chinese point of view it's a pretty safe fight China gets to flex it military at a long standing enemy.
I strongly think China would get it's teeth kicked In by an Angry India but from China's point view this is absolutely someone they want to scrap with.
I know that , all Iâ€™m saying is if china telling US to mind their own business, then let them Handle their own problems with India . If China and India.
So Pakistan and China? I am aware of these wars, but Pakistan is not a world class army, and let's be clear, China in the 60's wasn't the China of today(and there are serious doubts that China can fight even today)and fighting next door is not and indication of quality force projection.
