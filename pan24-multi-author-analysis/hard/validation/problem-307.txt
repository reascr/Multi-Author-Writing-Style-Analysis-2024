I remember when I first started following politics in like 2004, the 4th circuit more than the 5th was considered the most conservative - to the point it was absolutely draconian.
I just went and looked at the current composition of the court. 7 liberal appointees to 6 conservative appointees (I'm counting the circuit judges only and not those on senior status).
I understand he is against adding more than 9 justices, but have not heard he would block a replacement if say Clarence Thomas stepped down.
Personally I disagree him I thought Amy appointment was fine, not that I am a fan of her but republicans controlled the senate and POTUS and her nomination was fair game. My issue was with Merick Garland being ignored by republican controlled senate so they could add Gorsuch.
But candidly I am sure you can find comments like these from many democrats and republicans pretending to be consistent with nominations even though they are not.
The check on that is suppose to be voters but enough voters A) dont care B) supported him sticking it to the libs.
