The concern that the increases funding for the IRS will not be used to target the rich is fair, especially considering the IRS’s history of going after lower hanging fruit. However it’s painfully obvious the republicans don’t actually care about that.
You are literally commenting on a post devoted to an article showing that it is true. The 60s and 70s were 50-60 years ago, what the IRS once did is not what it currently does.
The IRS will keep doing this. Unless rules & regulations forbid or disincentivize this practice, the IRS will keep this stupid practice.
Yeah, all the nonsense about the IRS "going after" low income people is so stupid. Low income people make money in a way that their reporting is easily verifiable by a computer. They're also most likely to mess up and claim child tax credits incorrectly, etc - all of which is verifiable and issued a letter by a computer.
Exactly. It's when someone misreports a number from their W2, didn't report 1099s they received, both separated parents claim a tax credit for the same kid, etc. All stuff that's easily checked by a computer. The IRS isn't "auditing" random low to middle income people. That would be a complete waste of their time.
Rich people report all of the simple stuff correctly because someone is doing it for them. Then put pressure on the CPA to be as aggressive as possible in other areas where they're have to actually be pulled for audit or it will never be seen.
