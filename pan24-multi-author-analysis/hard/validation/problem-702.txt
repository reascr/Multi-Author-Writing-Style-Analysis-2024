The Chinese balloon from last week is something different, even if these things also turn out to be Chinese.
There's no confirmation of what objects have been observed today, but authorities were careful to call yesterday's shoot down "an object" and stated it definitely wasn't a balloon.
I just watched the Canadian press conference and they’re really determined to correct anyone who asks them to confirm it’s a balloon and really stressed about it being a cylindrical object, smaller than the previous one shot down.
I honestly think some people are just becoming desensitised to absolutely insane news. It’s like a form of denial.
Today, just scrolling news, I’ve found that bird flu has killed seals in my country, a haemmoragic fever that is killing people in a matter of hours has 200 people quarantined in Guinea and these "objects" that are being shot down, as well as over 20.000 dead so far in Turkey and Syria and Ukraine taking out a Russian Terminator tank.
I also blame Putins nuclear threats for some of it as now it seems that it will be a case of "the boy who cried wolf" when it comes to trusting what is actually a credible threat until it proves that it is.
