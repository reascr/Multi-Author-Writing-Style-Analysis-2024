Pew polling in May had <20% of the country in favor of a total abortion ban with no exceptions. Which Republicans are going for.
Republicans will probably be over Trump, centering their party for Desantis. Who even now polls very well against Biden.
Imo the nomination is Biden's if Biden wants it. And he will have the benefit of incumbency advantage against any nominee the Republicans put up, unlike any new wildcard nominee.
The problem is, a generic centrist Republican is very unlikely to win the primary in today’s Republican Party.
Only one Republican will win the primary so there won’t be any “splitting the vote” with Biden other than Biden vs. the Republican that wins the primary.
And you can easily say that if Biden ran against some generic, centrist Republican like Larry Hogan or something, there is a decent chance he’d lose.
Replacing Biden right now would be a terrible mistake for Dems, especially considering the impressive midterm performance the Dems put up, and the impressive amount of legislation that was passed in the first two years of Biden's tenure.
I do think that one underrated factor here is the 'boring' vibes that Biden gives off, which allows the Dems to pass consequential legislation without inspiring much negative polarization... no matter how hard the GOP tries, they can never successfully portray him as a radical leftist the way they could for Bill Clinton and Obama.
