You're probably more correct than you think. This tunnel is an ancient aqueduct, literally a plumbing system. The "Cleopatra's Tomb" claims are more than a little premature.
And why would Augustus give Cleopatra a good burial? He tried to strike her lover Antony from the historical record. He murdered her son Caesarion and wanted to take her back to Rome to hang during a triumph or rot in a prison.
I personally wouldn't trust much of this. This stuff is lost to time, and archeologists and enthusiasts try to ramp up hype of these discoveries.
Now now... archeology is a hard field to get into, which many undergrads fail to realize. I think it's only fair that we let the interns fight for the chance based on a multitude of tests measuring one's smarts, wit, agility, physical prowess and plot armor. No need to waste time with people who would just die and fall on something, risking breaking ancient artifacts that belong in a museum. With Harrison Ford due to hang up the whip after the next movie, it's only fair we start thinking about casting a new Indiana Jones.
