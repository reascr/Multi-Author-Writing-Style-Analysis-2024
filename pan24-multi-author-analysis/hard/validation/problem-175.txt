...a treaty they're already in violation of by not allowing US weapon inspectors in to inventory their nukes.
They're unlikely to give a shit about the treaty at this point. What's one violation on top of another?
Yes, even if we watched it happen on satellite and were standing next to the Ukrainians who did the drone strike, the treaty still indicates that they have to inform the US of the loss of hull.
Iâ€™m not hearing any verifications here in Ukraine, but the current missile/bombing attacks happening across the country right now sure seem retaliatory given these events being in the news this morning.
That ofcourse doesnt mean Ukraine shouldnt strike inside Russia, but i can at least understand why the US doesnt want its weapons invloded in strikes deep in russian territory.
The rule about not attacking russian territory is with the weapons they are being given from the west, not the weapons they have.
They have been sneaking helicopter attacks into russia every once in a while. They just dont publish it and the Russians downplay it, there was an amazing video of Hinds hitting a fuel depot early on.
