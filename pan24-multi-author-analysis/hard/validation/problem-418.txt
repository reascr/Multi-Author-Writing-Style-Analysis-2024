It's interesting, because as it stands, the Anglican Church is...kinda set up like a network of terrorist cells. Each Diocese is independent of the other, and largely free of influence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. There's no Pope to issue edicts that all must follow.
The GAFCON thing is pretty huge, and a big threat to the Anglican church, and they don't appear to being going anywhere - in fact, with normal people leaving the church, only the nutters will remain.
The vast majority of this change comes from people no longer feeling they need to put down 'Christian' just because they were baptised CofE and haven't set foot in a church outside of weddings and funerals since.
It might seem like semantics to a modern ear, but as far as the church is concerned, this is very different.
One Anglican bishop actually called this back on the 60’s when he wrote that a lot of Christian language alienates modern listeners. The idea that Christ “ascended into the heavens” which begs the question, how far “up” did he go?? The mere use of the word “God” which he argued should be halted for a few generations to wash the bad taste out of everyone’s mouths. Essentially, he argued that the church must learn to become relevant to modern people or the hardliners would take over and accelerate its irrelevance to all.
