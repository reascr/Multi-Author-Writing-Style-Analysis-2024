They're not in great shape for 2024 as is even if they do squeak the House. If it's a narrow enough margin, McCarthy will have relatively less influence and there will be substantially more pressure against Republican obstructionism. The public is, by and large, fed up with Republican bullshit. Republicans are starting to get fed up with their bullshit. That they can win the House at all has more to do with structural deficiencies in our representation than the will of the people and when the electorate sees the next 2 years of potential progress stymied by shitheel Republicans, I don't think they'll be able to spin anything easily back in their favor.
I wonder if Dems could get the support of 3 Republican house members (if the margin ends up being that small in the house) to end the Hastert rule, so the Democratic minority can still raise bills.
I’d prefer Dems to hold the house but if it’s a 1-2 seat majority then you’ve still got the potential for a few defectors to help get things done (or not done in the case of bullshit impeachment hearings. Think about how frustrating Sinema and Manchin have been in the Senate and then imagine 218 of them running around on the Republican side. It won’t be as good as a democratic majority but it might prevent things like disbanding the Jan 6 committee.
