Exactly. It behooves Russia to also know he’s going to be there because one missile too close and we’re all in for a mess. And all Russia can do is sit there and basically go “okay we won’t attack while he’s there.” And it plays great for Ukraine and allies.
Putin's remaining hope is that the world tires of the war and loses it's taste for supporting Ukraine. This is typically not an unreasonable hope. Countries often lose interest as these conflicts drag on.
By showing up and reinforcing the support of the U.S. Biden sends the message that this isn't one of those times. And it strenhens the resolve of the other countries who have been supporting Ukraine. Putin surely isn't happy today.
Putin has had a few staged photo ops of him standing with some troops. However, people have noticed that some of the same "soldiers" are in different shots taken at different times.
Yes, but he also knows those pictures make him look like a paranoid weakling. So he occasionally stages some artificial photo op to trick his people into thinking he's not hiding in a fortress.
