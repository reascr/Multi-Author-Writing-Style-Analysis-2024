Iâ€™m also not as concerned about that. In the case of Biden winning 24, even if he dies in office that still allows someone else to start gaining steam on the national level for four years.
Thinking towards 2028 though, it's possible it could be better to replace Biden now rather than let the pendulum swing back to the Rs later. I know everyone's saying the incumbency advantage is too good to throw away, but we have 8 year max presidents. They might be better off waiting for the Rs to play their hand before deciding who the best candidate is.
If trump and desantis are going to eat each other alive, it might be an easier win to take advantage of the current divide in the republican party(given there's rarely ever divide there). Take the riskier, but possibly easier, win now and save the incumbency advantage for when there isn't a giant Big Mac stain on their entire party. 4 years of Biden and 8 years of a much more progressive candidate(That without the current divide might not be able to win) is a whole lot better than 8 years of Biden.
And if anyone on the left says they are too new or have too little experience in politics, I'd tell them to just roll with Biden, then. I think if Biden actually made a point to pass the baton to either and support them 100% while Trump and DeSantis are arguing which of them is the bigger sex offender and which can ban the most stuff and execute the most people, they should win.
I'd go with Josh Shapiro or Mark Kelly because they won in important states that need to stay blue and they both seem capable of de-pantsing DeSantis/Trump in a debate...not that debates happen anymore, right?
