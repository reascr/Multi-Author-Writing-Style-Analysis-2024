That’s very true. I wasn’t even aware of that until a few months ago. China nation-building in Africa was just not something I’d’ve presumed to happen.
Yeah, and Japan will remilitarize. A weakened Russia, allied with China, North Korea, and perhaps a handful of middle eastern entities will not do well against the rest of the world…but nuclear deployment by last resort (which thankfully hasn’t happened with Russia yet) is something scary to consider.
Russia’s flailing has clarified many things, not the least among them being that if you’re not suicidal enough to use nuclear weapons, the West doesn’t have time for your bollocks. There’s no economy or political system around, China included, that compares to the US’ investment in military might.
The US has also been able to interlace its economic dominance with its global logistical superiority by spending in such a way that many of its own allies pull back on their own military spending as a result. I cannot overstate this, the idea of your external influence being so significant it causes you to curtail your own external investment is baffling. The existence of the US military literally causes other countries to invest less in their own defense.
The reason this is so important to the hegeonomy of a nation is in its ability to protect export assets. It's a super weird conversation that very rarely comes up in the discussion of modern global economics because the security of assets is almost universally guaranteed. That wasn't always the case though.
Russia's actions in Ukraine actually handed the US another 50+ years of total global hegemony and it's absolutely idiotic that they couldn't foresee what they were doing. They've shifted energy policy in Europe virtually overnight, and it's done nothing but reinforce how far ahead of the game the US really is in military infrastructure. Specifically, military logistics of all things. The US does military logistics in a way that is eons ahead of anyone else on the planet, and that must make China anxious if it ever has real aspirations to take Taiwan. It's not happening in the next decade at least. Russia just gifted the US another decade of complete global domain.
Aside from maybe France, there are very few military developers that are even a degree of magnitude in alignment with the likes of Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, Textron, Northrup, United, GD, etc.
