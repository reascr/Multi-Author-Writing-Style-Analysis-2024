Now, I'm not an Ukrainian so take this with gigantic pinch of salt. Since Minsk1 and Minsk2 were so successful in stopping Russia from seizing additional Ukrainian territory and invading Ukraine after Minsk1 and Minsk2, for Minsk3 to take place, Russia would have to pull back their troops into internationally recognized Russian territory FIRST. You can't punch someone in the face, break the nose, take the wallet then turn around say "Ok everyone let's just calm down. I will take the cash. You can have the wallet. How about we just go our own separate ways now?".
Yes. NATO was in talks with Ukraine past 2014, in reality they started in 2002 under bush. The point of the article is to try to make people understand that pushing for peace should be a valid option, and that, yes, while Russia has escalated this conflict greatly, both sides pressing hard and not backing down is a bad thing and could easily escalate out of control.
A Minsk 3 agreement would mean that Russia does not annex, but Russian troops withdraw on the promise of a continued autonomous zone, functioning as a kind of dmz for them.
A Minsk 3 agreement would look like all Russian troops leaving Ukraine, UN peacekeepers stationed in Luhansk and Donbas, autonomous but with UN oversight.
Pushing for a peace deal where RUSSIAN TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM UKRAINE is the rational decision. Please actually read the article I linked.
Read the article. He’s not siding with Russia, he’s asking for more attention to be given to peace talks.
You know Russia has no intention of honoring any kind of ceasefire. If Ukraine agrees to a ceasefire, it will last all of a day at maximum. Russia has shown time and time again throughout this conflict they will not honor the agreed upon standards of war, and they will not honor ceasefires. No one believes them anymore. They have made their intentions clear. They will not leave Ukraine willingly. They will finish their genocide of Ukraine if given the opportunity.
