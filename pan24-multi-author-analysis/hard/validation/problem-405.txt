Possible ? Yes. And overworked operator that has to look at a 360p shitty as Black and White feed for 2 hours straight might just miss.
If i had to guess, i think it probably either was a UA S300 having some sort of launch malfunction or a Russian Cruise Missile.
It wasnt fired by Russia because it is an S300 missile fired by AA defense that accidentally fell in Poland because self-destruct failsafe did not work.
Was there a Russian missile flying towards a Ukrainian target, a Ukrainian operator trying to shoot it down with a counter-missile, and missing? If so, did the Russian missile hit its mark? In other words, was the counter-missile warranted and shouldn't have had its flight terminated - it just missed? If so, why did it miss? If not, was the counter-missile launched without a valid target to defend from? Was it an 'extra', a 'backup', was the operator misguided and launched a counter-missile into the air while there was no Russian missile at all?
There's a scenario where any of the number of systems used failed - there was a false-positive identification of a Russian missile that was never there; the operator launched the counter-missile correctly but something unexpected affected it, etc. This goes back to the main issue for me - there would be no counter-missile launched if there was no aggression of a foreign country that Ukrainians have to defend their lives from.
Even if the missile was fired by Ukrainians as a part of anti-missile defense yesterday, but then strayed for whatever reason, Russia is still to blame - there's a reason Ukraine launches defensive counter-missiles.
Most of the russian missiles targeting west Ukraine isn't fired from russia, they are fired from Belarus.
Had Russians not fired 95 missiles over Ukraine yesterday, Ukrainians wouldn't need to counter them. The war is Russia's fault and responsibility, including any accidents and side effects along the way.
People still died, and if this is truly on Ukraine it is in their responsibility to not shift blame. IF they stand up to it and make an honest push to be better, people will forgive them in no time. But deflecting is honestly as bad as Russian rethoric.
