Now one of them was from I think a month ago, and another from 1-2 weeks ago, so technically if you would've asked them today - probably it would have changed a bit to this side or that, but I don't believe that it would have shown a different picture really.
The protests are estimated to be at best around the 100K people. That's 1% of the citizens in Israel, and 4% of the people who voted in the last elections. By no means do they represent the majority of Israel.
Israeli here. Most recent polls have shown that even if a majority want some sort of reform in the judicial system, the current reform is very unpopular in israeli society, even in ppl that voted for the likud (bibi's party).
Here's a quote from the article you've showed: "But a recent poll by Israel's Channel 12 found that only one in four Israelis supported the judicial reforms". Your article is from yesterday. Which means that he's talking about the latest poll made by channel 12.
So I've sent the latest poll made by channel 12. It's not "attempting" to discredit, it's actual discrediting.
