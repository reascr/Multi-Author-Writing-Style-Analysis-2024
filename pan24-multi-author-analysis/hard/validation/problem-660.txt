A 30% price hike on essential goods, which will include utilities, will shut the lights off on probably about a fifth of American households. That means the elderly and sick are going to freeze or cook in extreme weather, there will be no way for many of them to cook or bathe, and no food storage. I think that's where you're going to see the country fold in on itself.

They want people to pay 30% on every purchase ($30 for every $100 spent) but are trying to pass it off as a 23% tax because $30 tax divided by $130 is 23%.
"Hey, did you know that Republicans want to put in a 30% sales tax to raise money for the government? That would add $1.20 per gallon to the cost of gasoline. Do you really support Republicans?".
