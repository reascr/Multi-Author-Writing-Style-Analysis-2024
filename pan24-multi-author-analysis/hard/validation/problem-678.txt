How would you know he did if no call to action exists? Him revving them up is far more easy to digest then to think he planned for a bunch of dumb asses to storm their senate when they were out on recess.
Wouldn't we have heard of something triggering these people to go riot? I feel getting this many people to do anything would need a call to arms to set off.
Hey, can someone explain to me why Bolsonaro is in trouble for the people storming the capital? Like, Donald Trump directed a crowd to the senate so it's obvious, but Bolsonaro was eating KFC in Florida.
That makes a lot more sense to me. I was so confused about why they are charging an ex-leader when said person didn't "do" anything specificly to kick off the riots thousands of miles away.
This means that when you're wondering how they could charge an ex-leader who didn't do anything, you're literally just asking why a situation you don't know anything about doesn't make sense to you. Knowing as little as you know about this situation, I have no idea how you were comfortable deciding that he didn't do anything.
Okay, so let's be really clear: you don't have a reason to think that he wasn't responsible for the attack.
