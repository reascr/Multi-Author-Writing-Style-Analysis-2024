California is the most ethnically diverse states in the United States - which is what the DNC is trying to achieve, reach a better consensus of candidate and appeal to more than white Democrats.
White Democrats have distinctly different priorities than minority Democrats or Independents, which the Democrats need to win state and nation wide elections.
Not all southern democrats are conservative, they can be more moderate but they believe in many of the things progressives do, but they care about who can actually win a general election to try and get the shit we all want.
This is about forcing progressives to win over conservative southern dems, which is a pretty tough proposition for progressives.
If South Carolina, a state which hasn't helped elect a Democrat since 1976, has the greatest power in deciding which Democrats are viable, what hope is there for progress?
I would've gone for my home state of Virginia to be first but South Carolina is another good indicator of support among the most dedicated voting blocs for Democrats.
