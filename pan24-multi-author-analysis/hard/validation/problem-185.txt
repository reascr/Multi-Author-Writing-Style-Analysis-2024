Lol this is a joke. This whole political landscape is a fucking joke. It took a former president, that no one likes, going there for these people to finally acknowledge this.
Great so multibillion dollar corporations will profit of the rebuilding. That’s still taxpayers money going to things that don’t help taxpayers. We ain’t flying Americans over to rebuild Ukraine.
The US isn’t giving Ukraine aid for free. The Lend-Lease Act was signed with Ukraine before giving them aid. The Lend-Lease is also required to be paid back, either through monetary means or the use of American contractors to help reconstruct a country, stimulating the loans back into the U.S. economy. It took Britain and Russia several decades to pay back their lease. Both repaid in full in 2006. At the end of a war, countries are required to make payments as a way of making up for the damage inflicted. This was the case at the end of both world wars.
We can only hold Russia accountable for now by levying sanctions against them and seizing Russian assets to help pay for it. We can hold Norfolk Southern directly responsible.
