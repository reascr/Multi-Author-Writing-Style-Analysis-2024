Itâ€™s about damn time the Democrats start playing hardball with these nut jobs. I really really hope they stick to their guns about this, and if the Republicans fail to raise the ceiling and people start to lose government benefits they hit the Republicans hard and blame them for a problem of their own creation. If they were actually consistent and gave a damn about the government debt anytime a Republican is the President maybe we could debate here.
That was the thinking every time Republican's held the budget hostage to the debt ceiling and every time they payed dearly for it. The only reason I'm hoping they don't do it is that it would inflict significant hardship on vulnerable Americans but if they want to touch the hot stove again...
Sure, the MAGA crowd are completely disconnected from reality and will believe whatever they're told but the rest of the electorate will know exactly who is causing the problem.
This isn't our first rodeo. The Republican's have attempted this ploy a number of times in the past and every time it's come back to bite them in the ass.
Both GDP and employment are up. Gas prices are down. My stock portfolio is up about 5% year over year. What is this "not recovering" you're talking about?
