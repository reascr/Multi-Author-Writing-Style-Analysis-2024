Which is exactly why the warheads would be removed and switched with conventional warheads weeks before ever being given to the front. No one is going to be like “hey here’s a nuke” plops it down off truck “mind taking the nuke off and switching it for me?” To anyone near the front.
What would be the point of a nuke if it's the same yield as a tomahawk missile? That's just nonsense. Those warheads are likely 5-20KT, the typical yield of a tactical nuclear warhead.
This missile wasn't just a nuclear-capable missile with a normal warhead. This missile had no warhead, unless you count a lump of concrete ballast as a warhead. That's what made this so weird, Russia either launched a Kh-55 as a kinetic missile (+ whatever fuel is left behind), which would be really pathetic if true. Or they launched it as a test for how an actual nuclear armed one might go.
I think they're actually checking them all now, and anything that won't work as a nuke is being launched.
Waaaay back in the day when we had a mutual disarment some US and UN inspectors were there when Russia disarmed some nukes.
