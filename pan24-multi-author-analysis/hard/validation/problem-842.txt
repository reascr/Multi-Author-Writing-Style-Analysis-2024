What it will look like is that one crazy teacher (every school has one) that will out their own Christianity in the classroom and shove it full-bore down the throats of children as part of their daily routine. In high Christian (rural American) areas, students that do not adhere will be othered by peers, and the school will have very little recourse to help them navigate the problem.
Teachers overwhelmingly do not want prayer in schools, and overwhelmingly enjoy and care about children enough to not perpetrate the kind of discrimination you are suggesting. At the point that they are watching prayer and ticking off names on a clipboard is the point at which the line of religious fascism is far behind us.
“They” is not the big bad school district making structural choices to punish irreligious behavior, let’s not participate in foil hat wearing.
They are singling out atheism as being a problem while literally trying to force their way into public schools to indoctrinate other people's children. I hope they are ready for the Satantic Temple to be in their schools. Imagine the pearl clutching when that happens.
