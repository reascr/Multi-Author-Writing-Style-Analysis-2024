Yes, please! The 50 plus years of embargo has accomplished nothing. The Cuban leadership still kowtows to the Russian and Chinese governments. Perhaps a change in US policy will improve the relations between Cuba and the US and make Cuba more amenable to a democratic government.
Yeah, I cannot figure out if the anti-Castro Cubans in Miami are just dumb as a brick or have succumbed to the Russian propaganda which probably advocates status quo. Cuba is certainly not more democratic as a result of the embargo. The anti-Castro Cubans will have a better chance of making Cuba a democratic state by lifting the embargo.
If the anti-Castro Cubans hate equal opportunity, they can still vote for the GOP and also favor lifting the embargo. Their continued support for the embargo, which hurts their Cuban families back home, is a mystery to me.
The embargo is stupid, but Cuba would still have an awful government and economy without it. The embargo is not what holds Cuba back, not by a long shot.
Cuba's problem is not the embargo. They get everything they need from Mexico and China. Their problem is not to have any money to buy things.
