Police in the UK can detain someone at a Police Station for up to 24 hours, and have to apply for an extension of up to 96 hours if that person is under investigation for a very serious offence (namely, murder or similar.).
P.S. That press card is made by... the press. It confers absolutely no rights whatsoever. It has the same authenticity as Sheldon Cooper's official Justice League of America membership card.
What's yours? Because he shot an award-winning documentary then he can't ever be arrested, even in the heat of the moment or when he's being obstructive, not following police orders and not formally identifiable as a member of the press (because the UK has no such identification, so I could claim it and then what would/should the police do about that)?
The chilling effect for me is every dickhead turning up to every incident with a camera, claiming to be press, getting in the way, and police being unable to do anything about it and then being accused of being too "woke" or whatever other nonsense is doing the rounds by then.
People like a random guy with a camera claiming to be press (which gives him no right to ignore an officer's instructions) in undetermined circumstances where the officers KNOW they are on film and that any consequences will come back to bite them?
