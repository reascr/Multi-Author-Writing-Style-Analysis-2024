I overheard a conversation yesterday where in a span of 15 seconds a person went from literally yelling at the TV (FOX news of course) about Biden being a traitor because of five documents to Trump was the President and can declassify anything just by saying so.
I feel like Biden is baiting the GOP into investigating him for less than 20 classified documents so they would have to explain why they are defending Trump at least 60 classified stolen materials.
Biden believes that some of his secret service are Trump loyalists, so I wouldn't put it past them to plant these documents in Biden's properties to derail the Trump investigation.
"I'm not really concerned about the classified documents so much as why Trump was treated differently to Biden".
And to answer it, you might want to check the question you were asked where the interviewer literally laid out the differences for you in terms of the sheer number, Trump lying about returning everything and Trump's refusal to comply with subpoenas.
