He’s not wrong, but at the same time India must live with aligning themselves with Russia on this issue against basically the entire rest of the world.
So, Reddit comrades you can think of all you want; with the weapon cache that India has and public sentiment for Russia; India will never be against Russia in the near future. This government is loud about this thing as this has been helping them politically by playing those sentiments.
Every dog has its day. Then it was west's now it's India's. Wait for yours to reply. Which seems like a long way now as the power dynamics is changing rapidly. West being afraid of China, rightfully so. The only way to counter it is with India. Maybe after that fight is over, IF you win; focus on India.
Cool so if india gets problems with china or pakistan in the future, its not the worlds’ problem either? When china is encroaching onto india land, you want the world to say “big deal, its india’s problem”?
India has nukes so there is no realistic possibility of a full scale war with China. If India didn’t have them then there is a realistic need to choose an ally who would defend us better. In that case India would have tried to ally with the US even against their own interests. But thankfully we have nukes and the deterrence effect helps in keeping our ground and act based on what helps our interests the best.
If you think India relies on Russia’s military to defend ourselves then you’re joking here. We never did.
