We were never one nation. The north and the south, generally speaking, had alien cultural values in 1800, they had alien cultural values in 1900, and they have alien cultural values in 2023. (TBF however. what is the "south" and the "north" has moved around over the past 200 years; rural Oregon is north AF and has southern cultural values, while San Diego is on the Mexican border and has northern cultural values.).
enough is enough. California has had 6 mass shootings this year and it isn't even February yet. Fuck your gun freedumbz, we need strict gun control NOW.
We agree on one thing, Federal gun laws need to be enforced. But the interesting thing is that enforcing the existing laws would be more effective than adding to them. In addition, creating new laws wonâ€™t magically convince the ATF to enforce laws against shady gun store owners that it already refuses to enforce.
I don't think it was mandatory, but the restrictions on gun ownership meant most wouldn't qualify without applying separately.
It seems in the US you lot are just fine with the mass shootings. Just as long as your guns stay with you, that's clearly non-negotiable.
