the gap left by Russia should be entirely filled out by 2024,and this excludes the effect that warmer weather has had on gas consumption.
by this logic,Japanese households should heat with oil instead of gas,and Japanese industry should have never existed in the first place.
a lot of new LNG capacity will come online in 2023-2024,especially in USA but also in Canada, Nigeria,Mozambique,Egypt.
"a lot" might be relatively a lot compared to previous LNG capacity, but it's nowhere near the capacity NS pipelines had. NS1 had a capacity of 55bcm per year, NS2 had a capacity of further 55bcm. A typical LNG terminals Germany is building has capacity of 5 to 8 BCM per year, and they are building 2 a year now. At this rate we will need over a fucking decade to fill that gap, and we will be paying 5x the price. Also there is that little thing with Germany re-classifying Russian gas as coming from Poland and Czechia because they transit through those countries.
Germany is not re-classifying Russian pipeline gas, and Russia has already stopped deliveries via Yamal (pipeline from Russia through Poland) in 2022â€¦.
