Wish the players would join together, have a meeting and tell FIFA and Qatar that "unless you reverse the alcohol decision we will just play kick to kick for 45 minutes then another 45 minutes.
And of course there's also a question of whether it was ethical to ask Qatar to suspend their laws for the sake of football games, and whether it was realistic to believe them when they said they were fine with that... It's just a really fucking stupid situation with a really predictable outcome, and FIFA doesn't give a damn about the fans because they got their money.
But to the world cup itself: It's a shit show, not only because of Human rights, but because they now seem to enforce their archaic world view on the guests.
Why throw a ‘world wide’ soccer tournament if you’re intolerant of the rest of the world. (Rhetorical question, lol.).
As long as you’re not too loud, don’t have any public displays of affection, don’t drink too much, no cursing, wear the correct clothes, and respect only them and their religion you’ll be fine!
