Yeah. That's why I'm a firm believer in Socio-capitalism. As in- when society is functioning normally, don't touch anything, but when poor disadvantaged people are being preyed on, getting hurt, we have to step in and help them.
We tried laissez-faire capitalism (no regulation) and look what happened, economic monopolies lack of innovation, and abusive worker conditions.
Unions may not be perfect, but they should be made available countrywide for both contractors and regular workers. Sometimes, managers want to do the right thing but are pressured by higher ups not to. So having a federally enforced union will give good managers a valid reason to refuse unscrupulous demands from higher ups such as for example: "fire people without notice.".
Well. Iranian specialists/instructors reportedly were killed by a missile attack a month ago somewhere in Crimea/Kherson area(google for more pr√©cise info) while teaching Russian units using their drones.
Iran has stationed Revolutionary Guard units within Ukraine to directly operate the drones to attack Ukraine. You can't get a whole lot more directly involved than that.
I mean I get that you're not defending their argument. I'm just saying... it's not even a technicality. It's like saying, "Technically, Ronald Reagan is not dead." No, he's dead. There's no technicality there. You know?
