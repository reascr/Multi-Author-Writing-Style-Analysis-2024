There is plenty of discussion about this in Germany but two points to consider that are mentioned in the headline:
The law requires that these crimes are denied as to incite hatred and violence so no, no-one is going to be jailed for nor knowing whether Hiroshima was a warcrime or not.
If the law is against denying certain historical events, how can it be worded in a way that only applies to inciting violence? Maybe they should call it "violence incitement law" instead of "war crime denial law".
If the law really is written "just like" that, why is it a "Holocaust denial" law and not a "violence incitement law" then? Why does it (appear to be?) concerned with why someone incites violence? Is it OK to incite violence if it isn't based on denying atrocities or discrimination against a minority group?
War crimes like launching thousands of rockets on civilians, targeting civilians with bombs, knifes and assault rifles based on ethnicity?
Normally I would provide some of my own explanation, but you should just watch all of that if you care about having your facts straight about war crimes and genocide. Which you should.
