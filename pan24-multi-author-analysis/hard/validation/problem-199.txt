Basic summary: if this account is accurate, locals are furious about the Turkish government response. In particular, the Turkish government apparently plans to quickly bury victims in mass graves, something the locals see as an insulting attempt to sweep the disaster under the carpet. Some locals, allegedly, planned to put pressure on the Turkish government to stop their plan, by kidnapping international rescue teams, because this would gain international attention. For this reason, several international teams (not just Israelis) are pulling out.
Allegedly, the Israelis are the third national team to cease operations because of the security situation.
Having international teams pull out because the government can’t guarantee their security is a huge embarrassment for the Turkish government, and possibly a bad sign of serious trouble ahead. From what I have read online (which may admittedly not be a representative sampling), ordinary Turkish citizens are furious with their government, as both the preparations and response to this terrible disaster have been judged by them to be completely inadequate.
To my mind, the bigger story is this: it shows just how angry some Turks have become over their own government’s handling of the situation, and how much the Turkish government is losing control over these affected areas.
Perhaps you can give us your point of view on why this situation in turkey is surprising or unexpected to you given the history of the region?
