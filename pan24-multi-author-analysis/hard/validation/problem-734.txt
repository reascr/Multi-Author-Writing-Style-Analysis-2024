There's nothing in Finland to steal, and you can't get through Finland to anyplace you couldn't get through more sensible means of transport. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia make Finland a shitty route to invade Russia through, even in the kinds of paranoid delusional dreams where someone would want to invade Russia in this day and age.
Pardon the gap in my knowledge as I'm canadian so the political state of Finland is off my radar but do anticipate a war with Russia in the coming future?
I’m confident that every country that currently shares a border with Russia, or it’s lapdogs, have quietly pulled out their national defence plans and dusted them off to start going over them and revising them to fit the current state of the world and technology.
Putin will start getting desperate over the next several months and will have to do something major to try to show that his government is still strong and that the Russian military is still powerful. As it is now, he desperately needs a major military victory in order to get the troops to fight and not just surrender or kill their commanding officer and run away. This will become even more important as he starts drafting people from cities like Moscow.
