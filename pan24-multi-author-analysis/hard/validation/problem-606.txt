There was no way the Democrats would have won no matter who they nominated. No one was beating DeSantis. And the national party knew that. That's why they didn't give any money to Florida governor race. The national party abandoned Florida.
But Florida is also the state that may not be a swing state anymore. It's been trending to the right since 2010. And it took a big step right in this election. It's going to be quite some time before the Democrats win a state-wide race again in Florida. Losing the Hispanic vote by 57%? Yeah, Democrats in Florida are toast until that statistic changes.
The problem is that "Florida voters" means two different things. In the premise, it refers only to those Florida voters who lived in Judge Smith's jurisdiction. In the conclusion, she wants the reader to read it as all Florida voters; because why would it matter if a governor making a statewide appointment defied the electoral choices of a single district? Every governor necessarily makes decisions which many districts or municipalities would oppose if they got to vote on it, but that doesn't make for a pithy title and essay.
From what little I've read of this judge he seems abhorrent and there can absolutely be valid criticism of his appointment. My issue is with the idea that DeSantis is somehow defying the will of the people who voted for him by appointing the judge.The comment I responded to says:
DeSantis appointing that same judge to a state-wide position, objectively a much higher responsibility and higher level position, but then saying in not so many words "it's not the same as the jurisdiction of voters"...is pretty backwards logic. In what world do voters not have confidence in an official to perform a local-level job, but simultaneously that person would be adequate for a higher level state-wide position? It's terrible (or more likely biased) judgement on DeSantis' part to purposefully fail someone upwards simply because he has the power to do so.
