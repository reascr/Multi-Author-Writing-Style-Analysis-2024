One part of this is the decline of native plant species. Between expansion of suburban areas filled with lawns and introduced plant species, agricultural land, and introduced species escaping into the wild and crowding out natives, many insects are losing their food sources. The insects that eat those insects then also lose their food sources. Add in the careless use of pesticides and other air pollutants, and yeah..
Edit: everyone should plant an oak tree in their yard if you have the chance. They are immensely important keystone species that provides food and shelter for a wide variety of insects. Also going to plug “the nature of oaks” by Doug Tallamy.
Yes that’s true. Unfortunately it can be hard to find a wide variety of native species. If you’re in the Midwest, there is Prairie Nursery that ships plants. Also Prairie Moon nursery. You can always search for native nurseries in your area. I’m also lucky to have a farmer at our local farmers market who sells wildflower seeds that he collects from his property. And thankfully, the trend has been moving toward people wanting more native plants, and growers and nurseries are realizing the trends. I’d welcome others adding any native plant sources they know if.
Plant native plants in your garden. Specifically keystone species like Native oak trees. Remove a section of your lawn. which is a monoculture anyway. Dead zone for insects. Stop spraying pesticides, Add native pollinator plants! We all can make a difference. I live in an urban area with less than .2 of an acre. However, I have bees, butterflies ,birds flying around. Eating the seeds, berries, insects. My neighbors who only have a few non native foundation plants and who maintain a lawn. Have barely any life in there yards. Be proud of your area, and incorporate life. By planting native plant species. Even if all you have is a balcony. Add a few native plants in pots and see what happens. Like milkweed. The only host plant for the monarch butterfly.
Reading one of Doug Tallamy books will blow your mind. And make you realize just how important native plants truly are. You’ll start to see all the plants in your community that do not add to the local ecosystem.
I’m going to look into the other pollinators in my area and add some plants to my yard to help them out.
My backyard beehive is of full of solitary wasps hunting the caterpillars in my butterfly garden (I support three native butterflys in my yard).
It's a lot of fun, I even had a huge "size of my hand" paper wasp nest built into the crook of my rabbit fence. All of those insects are predatory as adults, and I had a hundred. There must have been plenty of food and no pesticides in my suburban neighborhood.
(Before you NIMBYs complain, wasps in my insect garden are right where they belong. Quit complaining, they were there last year too and you never noticed!).
