Yesterday I made a comment about how Trumps tax records would probably be leaked soon. The people in the room don’t really know my political views but probably assume I’m conservative, considering this was a professional event and my job skews conservative.
Without a hint of irony or thought that maybe even “loopholes” might just be patently illegal fraud, that the president should probably be held to a higher standard, and that all those other rich people should probably not be getting away with skirting tax laws.
For years he has been openly bragging about how brilliant he is by finding loopholes in the tax code and yanking on them to exploit the system to his own advantage -- at the full expense of those beneath him on the financial hierarchy.
Additionally, he fought tooth and nail to prevent his taxes from being seen, and his reaction towards Weaselberg for committing tax fraud with his businesses was to reward him financially. Weaselberg is being rewarded for not flipping, these are mob tactics.
