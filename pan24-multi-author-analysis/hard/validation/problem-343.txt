Kanye thinks he can go and casually tell a guy who really needs to be president to stay out of jail and bankruptcy that he's also running and be welcomed with open arms. Trump thinks anyone who isn't 100% on his side and willing to sacrifice everything in one-sided loyalty is evil.
They both live in their own separate narcissistic bubble, so I'd argue it happened in two separate realities and neither is the one we live in.
Those who desire power at any cost are normaly such narcissists that they genuinely beleieve they are special, and reality we live in doesn't apply to them.
Having known a few narcissists in my life they are physically incapable of recognizing themself as the problem in all things and any therapists they have found that will point the finger inward are promptly fired. The ones they kept seeing are being played like a fiddle/if not narcissistic themselves, so they are kept around because they told these people what they want to hear.
Yes I hate to excuse shitty behavior because of mental illness but it is literally the reason they have shitty behavior.
