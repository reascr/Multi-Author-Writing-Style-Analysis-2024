It is absolutely possible and has been done in previous wars. Just put a stiff pressure plate or vibration trigger under a track sleeper and buried explosives next to it. Sometimes such devices are even equipped with counters to give the sabotage team more time to escape and obfuscate, when the explosives were placed. 1 train, wait, 2 trains wait, 3rd train explode. Given one can set arbitrary counter, it is impossible to tell when the explosives were placed.
Ofcourse these days with FLIR cameras and drones it is little bit tricky prospect. Burying a mine to be waiting under the rails takes time and one might not have time. With one sticking out like a sore thumb on a FLIR image while on exposed position at the rail tracks.
If possible they should mine the tracks to cause derailement. It takes alot more effort to repair and clear the tracks.
It seems risky to stay near the track long enough to mine it. It might take several days and the trips back and fourth might be suspicious. I'd like to think the resistance made the most of their resources.
