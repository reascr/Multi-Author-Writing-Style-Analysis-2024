Well one day he said that he had won the congressional medal of honor. Well, the other regular sitting next to him snapped and was like "You've never won the CMH, only x amount of people have ever won that medal and you aren't one of them". This other regular was generally a quiet guy so we were all taken aback by his outburst. The next day he showed up with a printout of every CMH recipient but the liar never ever showed back up again and he had been going to that bar for years.
I was just telling this story the other day but I bartended in a place that had a regular. He was certainly wealthy and was good for a $100 tip no matter the amount of his bill. He was a nice enough guy but would constantly tell the most outlandish lies. Some hits of his were he was a former professional baseball player, his wife was Miss Georgia in the early 80's, he invented the palm pilot for Casio, he was a guitarist for the Eagles Etc. Etc. Etc.
Ok. So, we have established that he is a pathological liar. Can we just ignore him now? He's in congress, there is nothing we can do. Ignore him. Pointing out his lies at this point is just redundant.
