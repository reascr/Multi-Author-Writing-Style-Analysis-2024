They may have been testing this idea a few years back by having people move from one state to another and then running for office right away. If someone from another state can violate the election laws, then why can't a foreigner come in and do it too?
Is that 3 contributors or just one. I mean, a migrant smuggler who is the cousin of a sanctioned Russian oligarch and a contributor to Trump could easily be ONE person.
This sounds like a joke: "A migrant smuggler, an unlikely Trump donor, the cousin of a sanctioned Russian oligarch and a convicted felon walk into a bar. Surprisingly, they're not all the same person.".
So. What he has really done is a favor. He has grossly exposed his party and used their nearsighted abolishment of political safeguards to his advantage and bested them at their own game. He's not the biggest rat in the room, he's the smartest. He was elected, got all the way to DC on a background carpet of lies, took his seat and will receive all the perks, pay and privileges of his position.
And he shows up. And someone started doing fact-checking on who the new guy in town is about. The lies and falsehoods come pouring out, and he's being snubbed on the floor.
Look at that lying SOB - this lier will soon have access to our Top Secrets. I believe this guy will spill to right wing fascist groups I tell information on their status in America We failed to control Fascist traitors.
You left our White Supremacist Fascist out Our country is now closer to Fascism. These right wing fascist have infiltrated all our government agencies - they donâ€™t believe in democracy - I blame right wing FOX with right wing propaganda.
