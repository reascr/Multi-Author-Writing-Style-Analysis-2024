As an Arab American and also an atheist and a liberal it is insane to me that in American politics the liberals support the Palestinians while the conservatives support Israel.
The progressive leadership's acceptance of anti-Israel (far more than pro-palestinian) and antisemitic people makes me hesitant to throw my support behind people whose ideas and ideals I may otherwise back.
Meanwhile the Israelis are mostly secular, have huge gay pride parades, have a democratically elected government, freedom of the press etc... you would think liberals would naturally align.
Americans think Jews and they think Bernie Sanders or John Mayer because that's what American Jews look like. Most Israeli Jews are from Arab countries.
The irony is most Israelis aren't white. They might not call themselves Arab but if they were in the US most Americans would think they are Arab.
I mean, only as much as Arabs are also classified as white in the US. Arabs and Jews are supposed to select white as their race on almost every from in America as white is defined also as heritage in the middle east.
