It certainly is a no-brainer. Walkable cities are the way of the future. It will be especially difficult for North American folks to adjust as the auto/oil industry really has people convinced that there is no alternative but that lie is slowly being exposed.
It's more about creating infrastructure and options for folks. Cars won't go away but how we move ahead is what is important. It's a build it and they will come situation...folks should be able to make choices that don't include driving a car. That's how you start.
You can start small. Cars can still be used for the relatively rare trips from rural area to cities or between cities, while cities themselves can become virtually car free. Then there's even more incentive to build rail lines connecting cities and rural areas, and car independence is extremely achievable. It's also the most efficient solution. Nations that embrace this will have an advantage over those that don't.
So wouldn't a mobility scooter or personal mobility vehicle be better for you than a car? Otherwise you have to walk much farther, eg unless a bar has a parking lot you can't go there, which limits you in some cities.
Walkable cities are indeed the future, but the problem (in Canada at least) goes much deeper. There's no transport between cities for much of the country. If you live in a rural area without a car there is literally no way to get around, inter city buses are non existent and as for trains let's say via isn't what it used to be.
But doesnâ€™t it make the most sense to have such massive and sprawling parking lots that you then need shuttle buses to take you to and from your destination?
