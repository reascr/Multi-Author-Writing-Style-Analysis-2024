Ukraine 'discovers' evidence of this plot by Putin and arranges for it to get leaked to NATO and the press... then Ukraine does exactly what Putin was going to try and make Belarus believe Ukraine was going to do. Belarus gets mad and blames Russia. Either there's a popular uprising or Russia gets ejected from Belarus and Ukraine doesn't have to worry about that northern border anymore.
Respectfully, I can't tell if you're confused about what's being discussed, which is a warning that Russia plans to fake an attack in Belarus and blame Ukraine.
I don't take issue with the idea that Belorusians would all see through the ploy, that's a fair opinion, but I don't see how it would be for the Russian people.
The audience is obviously the people of Belarus and Russia but I doubt the Belarusians will buy it, including Lukachenko. There is nothing in it for Belarus to join this war.
And that window fly’s right open if Belarus sends its army into Ukraine. I bet those brave protesters in Belarus have been planning for that very possibility this past year.
Lukashenko knows that if he sends his army in Ukraine his people will then see it as an opportunity to rise up and overthrow him. He needs his soldiers to stay in Belarus and keep him in power. If he sends his army into the meat grinder of Ukraine he knows his days are numbered, it’s why it hasn’t happened yet and won’t happen.
