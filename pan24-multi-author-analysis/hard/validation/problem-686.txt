Huh, I didn't realize that the Army has switched their standard piston engine vehicles over to JP-8. Although with more reading it sounds like a program that has been problematic. Would be interesting to hear from somebody who deployed recently about what fuels are actually being used, as opposed to the aspirational goals of the single fuel program.
All the logistics trucks, Humvees, Strykers, Bradleys, etc run on diesel. The Army transports plenty of diesel and could use it for the Abrams. They use JP-8 because it gives better performance, not because of logistics. That being said, Ukraine could absolutely run Abrams on diesel without a problem.
The US Army does other operators of the Abrams use diesel though. And to my knowledge for the first couple of years the US Army did too. Using JP-8 seems to be mainly done for logistical reasons. If you use the same fuel for your jets and everything else it means you only have to supply one type of fuel to your bases.
Some of the issues they had during the 00's were the base fuels being out of spec - easy for a turbine to deal with, less so for a piston engine.
They switched over in the 1990s, and there were teething issues that have been ironed out - namely the lack of lubrication for the fuel pumps when using JP5/8.
