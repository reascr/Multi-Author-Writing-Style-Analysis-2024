The lack of paying anyone definitely doesn't help him, but Trump cannot be truthful to save his life. Literally. He doesn't lie strategically. He lies impulsively, and he has no memory of what he's already lied about in the past.
All politicians lie, obviously, but usually they do it strategically. They do it towards a goal. They do a risk calculation before telling a lie to figure out if the risk is worth the reward. This is, if not ethical, very normal behavior.
If he were anyone else other than a wealthy white asshole with a giant silver spoon up his asshole and political power thanks to his remarkable ability to rouse the most simple and gullible people in the country, he'd be in jail on so many different charges that he'd never see the light of day even if he were immortal.
I mean, the world's biggest fuckup became president, lived an opulent life at the taxpayers' expense, has the worshipful adoration of a hundred million people and leadership of one of two major parties, and seems to have committed some major crimes without much of a consequence so far. I feel like his younger self might have seen all this and learned the lesson that lying is awesome. It's certainly working for Trump, even if there might be a horizon dimly visible now where he has real legal problems.
