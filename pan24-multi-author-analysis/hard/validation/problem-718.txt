This is my state, and it's been like this forever. Surprisingly, SC is not that red of a state. It's about 55/45 in statewide elections, and some of that is due to voter suppression and the fact that a lot of liberals find it pointless to vote because Dems never win anymore.
Democratic states keep pushing strict gun control, so the pendulum swings the other way in red states...This is entirely predictable.
Pushing gun control is a losing issue, Democrats in office need to figure this out before the next election.
High or large capacity magazine bans for anything over 10 rounds that would ban stock magazines of the most popular semi automatic handguns.
California bans sale of all semi-automatic handguns to civilians besides a very small list of "on-roster" handguns that are "verified to be safe".
Assault weapons bans that would ban all semi automatic rifles due to how they define a stock and heat shield. That ban 50 oz handguns that would only really affect handguns used for competitive sports shooting.
