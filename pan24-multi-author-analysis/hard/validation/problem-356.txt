Legit ask, why is this uniquely laid at their feet? Dems contested and denied 2000. Dems contested and denied 2016. Dems said they would contest and denied a fair election in 2020 up until they won. However, apparently this is only a Republican issue?
It is disingenuous to dismiss 2000 by speaking on Gore only. He was not the only figure in that debacle nor was there zero rhetoric of "fraud." Let's not forget, he did rescind his concession. What transpired through the recount process was a lot of claims of fraud during the fight.
The part about claims of fraud in 2000. Gore wanted a hand recount because it appeared his supporters were more likely to have minor mistakes in the ballots, which would have shown up on a hand recount. He rescinded his concession when it became clear NBC (influenced heavily by Bushâ€™s cousin, believe it or not) was talking out of its ass when it called Florida. (Similar to Fox talking out of its ass when it called Arizona in 2020.).
which is again not true. They will try more and try again, but they will try new tactics so maybe it won't be "denial" as much as stealing elections through.
