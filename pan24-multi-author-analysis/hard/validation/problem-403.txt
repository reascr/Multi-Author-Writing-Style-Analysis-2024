The middle ground of "I want to stab you a bunch" and "I don't want you to stab me" is "I will stab you a little.".
Yup. A good friend of mine does that. Says he has a laundry list of qualifiers about who he's going to vote for. Always votes for the republican, hasn't voted for a democrat in decades. Claims he only chooses the best person for the job. I usually call him out on it because its so freaking stupid.
This is stupid. Given our technology to travel and communicate instaneously, we'd be able to quickly change the living arrangements of citizens if we really needed to. Think of the positive side, the blue states would have universal health care, education, work programs, infrastructure projects, etc.
Blue states become progressive utopias when everyone with morals concentrates to them and stops having to subsidize red states.
Red states crumble to the ground and vanish along with everyone like her when they collapse due to their backwards ways and zero education or financial crutches.
