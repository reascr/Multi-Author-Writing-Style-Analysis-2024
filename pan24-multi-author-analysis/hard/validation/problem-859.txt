What did you say about the missile? I’ll have you know the missile has over 300 corrective commands and is the top of moving itself to a position where it isn’t.
The fact that they don't tells me that they are either unable to or too slow to find the aforementioned targets in a timeframe that allows them to be targeted with a cruise missile.
CRAMs like the Phalanx have a success rate of only around 50% against cruise missiles and other relatively slow missiles. They are incapable of intercepting ballistic missiles or hypersonic ones. Israel’s Iron Dome would have trouble intercepting all of Russia’s barrage of missiles against Ukraine as it was designed to defend against Hamas rockets, not actual cruise missiles.
China has enough ballistic missiles to destroy the majority of Taiwan’s air defences, radar stations and open military installations many times over. They don’t need to land troops within the first month of an invasion. All they need to do is cut the island off from any resupply and that’ll be pitifully easy. The US won’t want to get so close in range to China’s overwhelmingly large anti-ship missile stockpile and without a military escort, there will be no resupply of Taiwan.
Or China could just send a massive wave of missiles against all of Taiwan’s airports, sea ports and transport links to completely cut off the country’s food and weapons supply and starve the country into submission without needing to land a single troop onto the island.
I exclude the iron dome because it uses interceptor missiles to protect wide areas, which is not something Taiwan needs... China simply cannot destroy Taiwan to claim a victory. They need those chip fabs, they need those people, and they cannot afford the geopolitical cost of such a public slaughter of the people of Taiwan.
They don’t need to flatten the island, they just need to destroy any means through which Taiwan can get international assistance. That includes airports, sea ports and major transport links. They can leave residential areas and most of the cities intact. China most definitely has the capabilities for a mass precision missile strike.
Taiwan does not have the capabilities to completely defend their critical infrastructure from Chinese missiles. This is fact. Missile defence systems meant for ballistic missiles are not 100% effective and it’s much easier being the aggressor than defender here. China has too many missiles and Taiwan has too few defences to cover all their critical infrastructure.
So it’s safe to say CRAM systems in Taiwan would have a lot of trouble defending vital infrastructure like ports and airports against a barrage of missiles. CRAMs are also extremely close range and have a very small window of opportunity to destroy the missile before it hits its target.
