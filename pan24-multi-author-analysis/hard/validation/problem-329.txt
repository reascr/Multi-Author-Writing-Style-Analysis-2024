I am worried, however, that her independent candidacy will hurt the Democratic candidate more than the Republican candidate in Arizona. Keeping the Senate in 2024 was already going to be tough for Democrats, and this makes it tougher. But I still don't see what they were supposed to do about it.
Nothing has changed. Sinema is going to continue to vote the way she's always voted, which means the Democrats will still be able to continue investigating Trump and appoint judges and do all the other things 51 Senators allows them to do.
Meanwhile her swing vote on legislation is much less important now that the House is controlled by Republicans. It's unlikely she'll hold up any legislation that the House hasn't already nixed.
This is really about skipping the Democratic primary in two years when she runs for re-election. She knew she would lose it, so if she wants to run again, as evidently she does, she'll have to do it as an independent and hope for a plurality in a three-way election.
She’s switching because she will lose in the primary and now that there’s 51, she’s not as necessary in the caucus. I’m not sure how many votes she can pull in and how lousy of a candidate Rs put up will be significant.
