Anybody who followed the events as they unfolded knows that he said it in a completely different context (stopping the certification), and the issue was settled by Feb 22nd with Germany ending it. Itâ€˜s obvious how Russian trolls are trying to capitalize on the gullibility of the uninformed.
The Russians are quite capable of harming themselves in order to blame others or send a message though.
The reason why I don't think it was Russia is simply because it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face. They own the pipeline. The gas that travels down it is a major source of income for them. There is no scenario I can possibly think of where it benefits them to cause damage to their own assets.
Other countries have been bandied about, pretty much all of them NATO countries including the US. But while everyone is claiming it was sabotage, we haven't really seen any evidence in public that it was. Fragments of a detonating mechanism, or the bomb itself, etc. So we basically have to take the word of governments for it, and they may have some hidden incentives.
So I'm still not completely counting out the idea of accidents due to poor maintenance and lack of use. Especially since they happened 17 hours apart.
It benefits a number of other countries, though. Foremost being Ukraine, but I honestly don't think they've got the assets to pull something like that off. At least, not without some major outside help.
