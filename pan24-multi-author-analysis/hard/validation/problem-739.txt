If you just tax the shit out of legal drugs, you will still have a black market for drugs. This is exactly what we've seen in California and other states that have had legal cannabis for years now. We still have a huge black market for cannabis, bigger than the legal market. Because too much taxes and regulation.
I agree drugs should be legalized, but we need to stop kidding ourselves with the "legalize it and tax it" idea.
Edit: Also no place in the entire world stopped the black market for cannabis by legalizing it. Black market weed just goes cheaper and is usually unclean cannabis grown for legal market.
So the legal cannabis will be safer. Don't claim it will be cheaper if you also want quality. You don't get cheap and quality from almost anything in life.
Stringent Quality checks create situations where a farmer can grow hundreds of pounds of cannabis. But fails tests because a single bud in that batch had a few microbes on it. Now they need to build infrastructure that can grow clean cannabis with no mold or microbes or heavy metalsor anything. This means they need to sell the cannabis at a higher price to make up for all the infrastructure needed. But wait they already have a few hundred pounds of cannabis that cant be sold on the legal market. 90% of farmers aren't destroying their crop if they can help it. They will dump hundreds of pounds of "dirty" weed on the black market. Which will be bought because its cheaper than the over priced legal weed that is overpriced because red tape increases the cost to produce cannabis and that cost is paid by the consumer not the producer.
