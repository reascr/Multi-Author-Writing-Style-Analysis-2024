And assets owned by foreign companies instead of domestic ones, same with a large portion of the few industries there. It's kinda fucked how much we in the developed world benefit from the underdeveloped world existing.
Yes the corruption is a huge problem, but pretending it doesn't benefit us and is atleast to some degree our fault is just wrong.
I’m not saying they are blameless, but you need to realise that people accepting bribes are at least as bad as those offering them. If the government and locals are willing to take bribes then they were already corrupt, they didn’t suddenly become corrupt as a result of the multinationals.
The foreign companies are feeding into that corruption. They are part of it. Its insane to think they are blameless.
Where specifically are you talking about? Colombia 100% has the capacity to mine gold, people there have been doing so for hundreds of years. The vast majority of the workers in the Chinese owned mines are locals. But the Chinese pay off the government to grant them absurdly profitable land rights, they pay off the guerillas to leave them alone, and they pay off the local police to harass anyone who tries to organize any kind of local activism to stand for the local workers and communities. They offer things like low interest loans or to pay for local infrastructure or environmental treatment plants... then they just don't do any of those things, take the gold and the money, and leave these already impoverished places in even worse shape than they were before, with less resources and more corruption.
