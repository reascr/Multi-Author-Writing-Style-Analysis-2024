This is an attempt to frogmarch public schoolchildren into Christianity and taxpayer money into the hands of private donors who'll donate generously to the Republicans.
Don't kid yourself. In their view, a child that doesn't believe in Jesus is as unwanted and unwelcomed as a trans child or a gay child. So is the kid who is gutsy enough to speak up for those kids. The kids that don't conform would kicked from school to school and it would be part of their permanent record that they're "troublemakers.".
Yes. That's really it. those meet at the flag pole things were scary to me, growing up in the Bible Belt. Everyone knew who wasn't there, and they tried to make those kids' lives hell for it. It's scary Christian nationalist shit.
They'll be stripping the public schools of all the money eventually, and the public school kids will be left out of their Christian nationalist schools.
Once public schools are destroyed, they'll end vouchers and charters, leaving only expensive private schools most of the public won't be able to afford, and the public will just be SOL. In the meantime, it's a huge transfer of wealth from the public into private hands, and eventually, education will only go to the most privileged.
