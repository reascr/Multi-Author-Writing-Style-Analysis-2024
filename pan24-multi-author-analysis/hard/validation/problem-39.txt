Lol, that's a sensationalized headline, like everything else on this subreddit. Brinton is the "deputy assistant secretary" of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition in theÂ Office of Nuclear Energy. Not exactly the "Nuclear Waste Chief.".
. . . Now, Hershey Walker was, at one point, very good at a sport. The gulf between these two is massive and far beyond party identity.
This is way pettier a crime than Pruitt or Carson or Kushner level theft and gritfting, but it's from someone we believed was qualified and directly and immediately stealing from someone directly rather than them largely robbing groups and looting from the public. Yet, here it is, still front page. It's far more likely for Sam or any other Biden appointee to have their crimes blow up here if they happen, since there's less fellow cons to spread up the news cycle. That said, hope those thieves from the Trump admin see at least as much consequence as I want Brinton to get.
Not remotely, since Sam is demonstrably competent and nerdy about very complicated fields of advanced study. But they're also demonstrably showing horrifying lapses in judgement, impulse control, and honesty that does render them unfit for positions of public trust. If it's something that they can treat, awesome, maybe they'll be in a similar position someday, but hot damn I do not need our most prominent genderqueer appointee making us look this bad on the national stage and I won't tolerate a critical member of the DoE exhibiting these behaviors.
