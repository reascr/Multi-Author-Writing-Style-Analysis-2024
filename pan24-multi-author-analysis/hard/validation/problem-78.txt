There’s “encouragement” from the other side too. The kind of encouragement that nudges you by posting your home address and harassing you in public for not being loyal enough to the dear leader. This is what populism is for Republican supporters, intimidation and threats of violence to extract the desired behaviors from politicians.
It encourages moderate republicans to try to distance themselves from their more extreme compatriots. It's Dems driving a wedge into the republican party and encouraging discord within the GOP.
If the GOP would rather have their own extremists in power than share power with the Dems, that's their choice. They can fret and cry and act like it's unfair, but it's their choice.
It can't be hijacked by extremists if the sane GOP members fight back and stop capitulating to them.
When has the GOP majority not bent the knee to the extremists in the past 20 years? They have been giving in to the extremists of their party for a long time now. Only difference is that they are now not afraid to say the quiet part out loud anymore.
Why don't you take your own advice and actually watch media outlets that don't match your right wing opinion? Because it's quite obvious that your only watching outlets that echo your political beliefs, and not the facts.
So I shall throw your words back at you, you are not doing yourself any favors by watching media who only confirms your beliefs.
