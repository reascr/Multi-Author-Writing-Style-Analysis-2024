Stop the Iran deal which will give them access of billions in frozen assets and sanctions relief, which will they use to produce more drones and ballistic missiles to spread terror and instability in the Middle East and else where, like Ukraine.
Iran: is supplying hundreds of drones used to target critical civil infrastructure before winter and is in talks in supplying more as well as ballistic rockets that will have it's main objective to destroy the power grid of a country in winter.(that can lead to a humantirian catastrophe at the scale of 40 mil people).
Not to mention how much this will affect the world. Imagine that every nuclear power will be able to just innade any country now and say: this is mine now, I got nukes.
Instead of stopping it in Ukraine you will now have to stop it in Poland/Baltics/Moldova but now also with extra forces from ukraine.
Now you have russia AND Ukraine that will be mobilized to fight further. Because remember - russia openly threatens other european countries and says it's at war with NATO.
Are you claiming that Ukraine - war torn, devastated by Russia's unprovoked invasion, desperately fighting off a much larger country - is planning to invade Iran? This makes so little sense it might have been written by a bot that randomly generates conspiracy theories.
