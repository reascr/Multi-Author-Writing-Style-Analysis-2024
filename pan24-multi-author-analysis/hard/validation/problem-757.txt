Reagan would’ve been fine in the modern Republican Party. He would’ve just adjusted just political beliefs to fit the times, he was an actor after all. He would’ve loved Donald Trump and would’ve had us sending weapons to Putin officially or unofficially.
I don’t think being anti soviet is comparable with being anti Russian. It is closer to being anti Chinese today. I see this come up a bunch some times and it ignores that the Soviet government collapsed and no longer exists. The closest to a successor state, Russia, has always had pretty far right alignments so of course republicans are more aligned to it.
Also you are right, while Reagan was trying to firm up his legacy he did do some last minute changes. But he also claimed he was no longer mentally capable in a criminal trial related to Iran Contra so eh.
I get what people mean when they say Reagan would be seen as a lib today. They mean republicans are getting more extreme. But the point misses that Reagan’s beliefs were moving as well with the time. Like Trump he would just move to the right along with the base. And then the reason that’s worth arguing is because the modern far right exhilaration is due to a lot that happened under Reagan so trying to return to that is self defeating. We shouldn’t be doing “make America great again” but for republicans.
Please please please Desantis, don’t bend the knee like all of the other republicans he made fun of before. I want to see the battle between these two.
