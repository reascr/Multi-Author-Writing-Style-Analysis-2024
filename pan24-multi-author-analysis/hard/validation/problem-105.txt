If poor people had access to lawyers like rich people, we’d need 30,000 Supreme Court Justices and a proportional number of lower court judges just to avoid the most simple of traffic fine from taking longer than the heat death of the universe to arrive.
Oh wait… we have an executive branch pushing the idea that a President may not be indicted. The Legislation passed laws to prevent insider trading and are doing everything they can to ensure they can keep that up as long as possible… SCOTUS members aren’t subject to their own ethics rules they set for Justices….
Hmm… but if “your” lawyers are trying to argue a mutually exclusive and self canceling position, their nonsense shouldn’t be entertained long, if at all.
So why don't they just call this out with their lawyers why does it take forever to sort this crap out? Aren't some things in law fairly binary? There are clear rules right? Can't they just be like "Nope. show up on Tuesday cheese dick.".
Care? Their most optimist moment for the guy was that they could lynch him. Dude is beyond pathetic. If we don't learn he has abysmal Kompromat (sp) it's double pathetic.
