Hochul isn't interested in diversity. Just milking the lowest common denominator of division. She's a status quo theist that imagines addicts just need to pray away their addictions. This charade of diversity is ridiculous.

What is your basis for determining that diversity is the most or only qualifications for these judges? Do you have a source for your claim, comparing the qualifications of these judges to the qualifications of those who didn’t get hired? Sounds like you have access to some pretty detailed info, or you wouldn’t have made such a claim, right? Can you share the data you are using?
“That total includes Dana Douglas, the first woman of color ever to serve on the 5th Circuit appeals court and Doris Pryor, the first Black woman ever to sit on the 7th Circuit appeals court from Indiana. “.

It could be 80% of the top 100 with the highest qualifications are of country dominant race of the general demographic. In that case if you follow diversity requirements you end up with less qualified staff as you have to pick more folks outside of top 100.
The best qualified people are being chosen, and then among the best qualified diversity is being prioritized.
You get you START with a list that only contains people who are fully qualified right? And statistically some are pretty much guaranteed to not be white men?
