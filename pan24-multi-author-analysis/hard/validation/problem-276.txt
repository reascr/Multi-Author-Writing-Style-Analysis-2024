I doesn't make sense that Russia did this on purpose (if they even did it in the first place). You don't risk a war with NATO over something like this... Of course, the possibility exists, but it just doesn't make sense.
Yes they are at fault, but context matters and they consequences change depending on it. Firing on Poland and firing on Ukraine and hitting Poland by accident are 2 diferrent things.
Could have been fired by Russia towards Ukraine but due to a technical difficulty in the rocket / middle hit Poland instead.
From what I've read it was a Ukrainian anti-air missile that hit a Russian missile which landed within Polish territory. Put simply, it was an accident. Russia isn't ballsy enough to jump on that nerve.
A lot of Russians aren’t buying the full war with NATO lie. And those near the top putting pressure on Putin aren’t buying it either. If there was at least a partial war, that changes things.
I mean, yeah. He can’t accept Ukraines terms (which are perfectly reasonable) because that would be a lose that not even Russia propaganda could spin in his favor. If the war keeps going on like this Ukraine will win.
Yes but you are forgetting Putin doesn't work in the best interest of Russia, or even actions that typically make sense. He just does things that he can spin in his favor. A limited war with NATO could work in his favor, not Russia's, but his.
That's a given, they had one reason to go to war with Ukraine, and that was to try to revive the "great soviet empire" (USSR) as Putin's legacy. Turns out his massive armies of unwavering troops are getting stomped by a country he thought was weak.
