The bots and shills haven't gotten their new talking points yet. Give it 24h. Once the software update hits they'll be back on track. That wasn't a joke or sarcasm. I've seen this before after big events.
They 100% don't care about reality. They'll declare that it is a mandate and push full steam ahead. Biden is all but guaranteed to be impeached multiple times if they get control. It's one of their deeply person goals. They need him to be impeached more times than Trump was.
12 impeachments, and that's probably about it. It looks very unlikely that the GOP will take the Senate. Even with the House, their margins will be so slim that it'll be difficult to pass any legislation. Assuming they have a legislative agenda.
I long for the day where democrats have true control of all 3 chambers and can get meaningful legislation passed.
Uh... the Democrats won in a landslide in the Presidential election and gained 3 seats to control the senate while still retaining control of the house...
To barely losing the house and keeping or even gaining a seat in the senate is pretty much a big win.
