Tetra Bio-Pharma has cannabis clinical trials currently underway against morphine, oxycodone and Hydromorphone. Will be a huge boost to them. They also have a separate partnership with Dr. Lance LIOTTA at George Mason University for cannabis based ARDS-003 which has shown promise against sepsis and immunomodulatory effects and halting the cytokine storm of covid. Bargain basement prices for the stock now but not for long methinks. They will be receiving a DIN from Health Canada in near future for Dronabinol and just won an international award in Malta for best cannabis medical device. Plus have patnerships everywhere including with DanCanna Pharma who just won the EU GMP designation . They have a ton of intellectual property, multiple patents and five Orphan Drug Designations.
Lets not forget the clinical work Tetra Bio-pharma is doing with Dr. Sue SISLEY for the treatment of PTSDin veterans. People tend to mistakenly treat this as a weed stock but it is a biopharma stock using clinical research to push cannabis forward as an opioid replacement.
The only reason you’re starting to think he doesn’t want to take any real action on cannabis is just because he doesn’t want to take any real action on cannabis.
I'm starting to think he doesn't want to take any real action on cannabis. I wonder if any of his friends or family are making money from the incarcerated, non-violent drug offenders who get thrown in cages while we spend all that money to "research" shit that we already know. This is dumb.
And before any "its a step in the right direction", tell that to the disproportionately affected minorities who get their lives ruined over a plant that god created.
