Put a microphone in John Robert’s face and ask _him_ this question. Lead it with, “you say that you are concerned about the perceived legitimacy of the a Supreme Court, yet a justice, whose spouse has alleged involvement in some cases, is ruling on those same cases….”.
And that’s the question: “Chief Justice, do you believe the court has a responsibility to recuse others of cases if they do not recuse themselves or do you believe justices should be granted the ability to judge their own behavior?”.
The next line of questioning should be if a Justice unable to recuse themselves and legislation that attempts to force them to step down is passed, what’s to stop the justices from overruling that themselves?
The line of thinking shows that we are in a constitutional crisis and really there’s nothing that if Ginni was say arrested right now that would stop Clarence from voting for her to be freed and this topic might mean that if there’s a constitutional crisis, the judges are above the law.
He won’t do it though cause he will give up his own power to do so—what he should do is step down if Clarence doesn’t and Biden appoints a new Justice and those justices would then be in a 5-4 split except there’s a better chance of a 8-0 vote to push Thomas off the board.
Just have Roberts make the choice to give up Thomas by accepting term limits and allow him to appoint a judge as a compromise with Biden (a type like Merrick) and there won’t be a civil war where the legal system is in shambles.
