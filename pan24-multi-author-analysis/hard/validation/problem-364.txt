211/435 races have been called for the Republicans, compared to 199/435 for Democrats. The magic number to control the House is 218 (435/2=217.5, so 218 is a majority) and Republicans lead in the votes for 10/25 uncalled races. This would put them at 221-214, a narrow majority. Democrats would need 4 of those remaining races to break for them in the final few ballots without losing their lead in any one of their current 15 leads to hold their majority. It's not impossible, but it is unlikely that it happens.
Regardless, whoever the Republicans (or Democrats) would elect as Speaker of the House is going to have to contend with the need to reach across the aisle for votes or placate the extreme fringes of their party. If the Lord of Hamberders continues to drive a wedge between the Republican base, things could get difficult for a Republican majority leader.
Boehner had a much, much larger majority than what the projected Republican majority will be. There are moderate Republicans, even if the mainline party is entrenched, and everyone in the House is up for re-election in 2 years.
Or if the Republicans took the House, but the ones that support DeSantis vote to let the committee continue?
Well, thats not how it works as noted below....Also, Republicans won't have control of the Senate and will most likely only have a small lead in the House. I guess Trump finally did some good with his endorsements. I kinda actually hope he runs so the Dems can win even more Senate seats and get back the House majority in 2 years while the Republican party implodes.
If anything, the republicans will probably want him to go away at this stage so he wonâ€™t have a chance to rip the party apart when he inevitably loses the primaries to DeSantis.
