Here in Sweden basically all the electricity companies are paying for solar energy you don't use. Since, well, it's your property & excess power. There's even stuff like stipends to have part of the cost paid.
Sounds very strange & exploitative that you'd need to pay for the panels AND the electricity they produce.
If you’re giving solar energy to the grid you already have an inverter. In fact, if you’re using solar energy in your home you you already do.
Solar panels are not the answer. You need a lot of them. It's only sunny during the day when you are at work. You can't heat your house during winter from solar panels when it's dark from 4pm to 9am. Places that get a lot of solar energy probably don't burn gas to stay warm in winter.
Solar panels are not intended to stop gas being burned, they're intended to reduce it a lot. At peak consumption during winter we can still burn gas.
Gas gets burnt during winter to heat homes. Lots of solar radiation in summer does not offset this. You still have to burn gas in winter for heat.
