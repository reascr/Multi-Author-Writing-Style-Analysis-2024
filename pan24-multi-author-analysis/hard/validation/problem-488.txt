I’m thinking that the world may have been slightly less unified against Russia when the invasion started if Biden hadn’t been so up front about what was happening.
Biden was saying for weeks before the invasion that Russia was going to invade, but Zelensky didn't believe it and it was he who dropped the ball in preparations. Even so, Zelensky still managed to protect Kyiv, destroyed Russia's elite troops and push them out of the area while he stood his ground, but the lack of preparation in the South is why Kherson and Mariupol was lost.
Why though? Financial support is just as critical as the military aid if we expect them to actually win the war, which at the rate they are going should happen in another year. I mean weapons are good, but you also have to pay your soldiers, which is sort of hard when 20% of your country is being occupied and your ports blockaded.
Also you can't supply an army in a week or two even if congress gave Biden the go-ahead to do so because of the logistics involved. As it is, Ukraine did pretty well with the minimal support we gave them over eight years given that they were total pushovers when Russia annexed Crimea.
Don't get me wrong, Russia shouldn't have invaded Ukraine, and they deserve condemnation, but the involvement now is getting a little bit silly.
