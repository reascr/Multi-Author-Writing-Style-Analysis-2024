But I agree there’s a big shift and I believe it’s not because of the Russian attacks on civilians made the allies do this. Those have been going on from the beginning of the war and only now we see these big changes.
It’s either that or ukraine is severely running out of ammo for their Soviet equipment (or spare parts) and they need to quickly change to nato stuff that the Allies can help with support and ammo.
It would have been easier on Ukraine for just one NATO ally to dump half of its military equipment into Ukraine while the rest of the alliance backfills that one country from their own stocks.
Ukraine is going to have bits and pieces of every western military, which is not great logistically and in terms of training. OTOH Russia is going the other way, digging into the Soviet-era stuff in the back of the cabinet, consistent, but woefully outdated and poorly maintained, unable to keep up production of the new stuff. Personally, as an armchair general myself, I think I would take the random assortment of modern hardware over rusted out Soviet bits.
