Russia does not have a point. They would love to convince as many people as possible that they do, but they don't. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and just assume you're naive. Please don't spread russian propaganda and talking points regarding their murder of 298 innocent civilians.
This is precisely why your insinuation that the judge would be biased and just blame it on russia is so misguided. After MH17 we wanted the truth. To insinuate that because russia is our geopolitical enemy now we could nicely pin this on them, is incredibly disrespectful. If you genuinely believe the downing of MH17 would be used as a political tool you really don't understand the effect it had on the Netherlands.
edit: Now that when you say the Netherlands isn't impartial, you're right. But the parties are the people who died and the people who killed them. Not Russia and Ukraine.
Yeah the thing I’m most worried about isn’t opinions of Russia on the world stage. We all know that logic and fact isn’t really their domain. I’m worried they just see that as justification to escalate to invasion or nuclear strike. Cutting diplomatic ties during a time like this could be very dangerous.
I feel like if we cut all diplomatic ties, Russia might see that as us preparing for war. Or at least as an excuse to preemptively strike while using the aforementioned as diplomatic cover.
