And now there is a huge push against public education. They're defunding libraries and attacking colleges. They argue that's colleges are 'woke', but in reality (according to statistics) people who are Democrats tend to be more educated and more empathetic, as well as visa versa.
They're deliberately trying to make a less educated population because less educated people make better wage workers and people won't fight it if they don't have the critical thinking to realize they're getting a raw deal. It's always been about pulling the wool over our eyes so the elite class can rule without government intervention. Most of the actual politics the right wing are pushing are targeted to limit the government's ability to function and sow doubt about facts that 99% of the scientific community agree on. It's become the party of misinformation and subterfuge. There's very little that the entire right wing party actually agrees on, and the things they do agree on are regressive as well as detrimental to our whole society.
The whole point was an attempt to explain to the public just how much the Overton window has shifted right and how there isn’t a real left anymore, contrary to those that talk about the non-existent “extreme left”.
I know its frustrating. I have family that I can just no longer deal with on these sorts of issues. They got mad at me saying “It’s just politics!” completely ignoring that beliefs beliefs are what form their actions.
There was a comparison done on MSNBC of some major policies between Reagan and Obama. Many policies were actually identical while on others, surprisingly, Obama was further right than Reagan was.
