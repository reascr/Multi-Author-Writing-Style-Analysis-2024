Allotting the whole 900B defense budget to it isn't going to fix it, it'll just increase the budget of a broken system by 20%.
Americans will get healthcare they fix their currently broken system that costs twice as much as a not-broken system.
universal healthcare would cost American less than the current system. There is no financial obstacle to achieving it, its not a binary choice between military spending and healthcare.
Yep the obstacle is purely political will not financial. The US gov already spends more as a percentage of per capita GDP on healthcare than the likes of Canada, the UK or France.
America already spends more on healthcare as a percentage of the federal government budget than any major European country.
The problem here is the de facto Republican leader is a Russian sympathiser, and the congressional GOP has frankly got a risible track record of standing up to Trump.
Trump is fucked, he's basically a Russian Asset, insurrectionist and corrupt fucker. But he's also something else: A Loser and a liability, this is why he won't have a chance, Republicans want to win the White House back but he's guaranteed to provoke people to vote against them so they'll quietly find a way to either get someone else the nomination for 2024 or slowly build a narrative to get him barred from Running. The Final Jan 6th report recommended him being barred it's up to them to use it to get rid of him.
