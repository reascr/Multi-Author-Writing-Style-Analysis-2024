It is assumed that over five years, due to a separate program for Ukraine, "significant funds in the amount of billions" of NOK will be allocated. In 2023, the amount will be divided equally between military and civilian support, including reconstruction.
Former director of the CIA, commander of the American group in Iraq, General David Petraeus, in an interview with The Washinon Post, spoke about a possible scenario of the return of Crimea by Ukraine.
"If Ukraine can completely isolate Crimea and if it has high-precision munitions, it will be able to start shelling the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, various air bases, various seaports and everything else, and then at some point enter the territory of Crimea," Petraeus shared the forecast.
A Ukrainian incursion of Sevastopol, an attack behind Russian lines on the small stretch of land that separates Kherson Oblast from the Crimean peninsula, or even an attempt to cut supply lines to the Russian forces attacking Kherson would require the Russians to move troops West really fast which would cost them in other sectors.
