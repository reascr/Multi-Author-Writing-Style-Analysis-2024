Yup. We really need and deserve a coherent explanation. We’re shooting unknown things down over the mainland. That’s never happened before (at least publicly.) This is an extraordinary situation relating to national security and honestly I think we need to hear from Biden directly.
It’s possible we did know and a policy decision has been made to stop ignoring it. Something has certainly been up as all the UAP stuff has demonstrated.
It may end up being pretty problematic that we went down this path, honestly. China or anyone else (or everyone else) can keep our Air Force quite busy and make us look weak by launching balloons frequently. They are difficult to conclusively attribute so we likely wouldn’t be able to place the blame easily.
No matter what this ends up actually being we’re going to hear conspiracy theories about it for the rest of our lives. It’s this generation’s rosewell.
Well NORAD just announced “defense drills” for Washinon DC on Tuesday, so who knows what the fuck is happening.
