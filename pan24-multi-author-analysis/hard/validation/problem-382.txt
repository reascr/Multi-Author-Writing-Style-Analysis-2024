Its a fine question. We must always remain vigilant that nazis never gain a foothold again. Hitler himself said the one thing that would had stopped them is to strike their group in their infancy.
I think you're confusing geopolitics with noble earnest pursuits, its empire, its imperialism! Plenty of shitty things are done and excused towards this aim. We funded absolute trashfuck warlords in Iraq, paid for the expansion of wahabism in the middle east to the tune of billions, all for empire. Ukraine is no different, though you and I happen to morally dislike Russian expansion. Why is it so unplausable that Israel did a shitty thing to further their greater motive?
Edit: To be clear, only some Ukrainians are nazis or nazi sympathizers (the same thing), No it doesn't reflect on wider Ukraine writ large. Yes I support Ukraine in their fight against Putin's army.
I mean, at minimum the Azov batallion are in part or largely nazis, oddly Israel helps fund them for some reason. However, there are plenty of actual Russians nazis, though clearly Russia is fascist AF, the aggressor, and international threat to peace.
When the Jerusalem Post reports that Jewish Ukrainian groups are defending Azov as an apolitical military unit fighting against an actual threat to the Jewish community by Russia, chances are it's no longer a notorious Nazi group.
