Brazil has curb stomped the FARC in the 90s during operation tra√≠ra. These guys are in for a rough surprize since jungle warfare is the main expertise of the Brazilian armed forces.
good luck to the Brazilian military, their going to need the big guns to deal with the illegal mining cartels. They have anti aircraft guns, recoilless cannons, lots of explosives and small arms. The private illegal miners will be fighting back too, they see mining as their only way out of poverty, and will gun down anyone who trys to stop them.
Its going to be a bloody mess trying to get rid of mining in that part of the Amazon, its been going on for so long, with so many now dependent on the underground economy, it could spark up serious unrest.
In the Amazon, you have a mix of semi legal small scale miners, illegal miners, and outlaws who do not give a crap what the law says. There is near zero enforcement of any law in the jungle, you cant police it, you cant even really enforce borders out there. One of my mentors spent 2 years working in an illegal gold mine from Suriname, but they didnt actually know which country they were technically in, it didnt matter, borders were non existent then. As a final note, corruption will take hold, military members will start working with cartels in exchange for immunity from the government. Its happened before, it will happen again, those that dont fall to corruption will start disappearing in the jungle.
