This fucker proposed that peace talks between Ukraine & Russia begin with Ukraine accepting that the territories Russia has annexed (but not conquered) belong to Russia and that they negotiate over the rest.
Any talk of Russia re-entering the international community can only take place after Ukraine is at peace, reparations have been (or are being) paid, and the war criminals prosecuted — all of them.
I dont think it is wrong to say that Russia should eventually rejoin the international community, but only after Ukraine's sovereignty is restored, war criminals are prosecuted, and reparations are made.
Untill Russia should be trusted and be part of international community again, there is a long way to go in the culture and mentality of that nation. They were helped not to lose to the nazis and wanted half of Europe for that and they were trusted again with Putin as a leader just to create this shitstorm that is going on right now.
From my point of view there were enough concessions made for them and besides the nuclear weapons(which I do not believe are an option for them at this point) there is nothing else that they have as a bargain chip. So I don’t see how this people think it is a solution for them to gain anything from the war in Ukraine. It is baffling!
