Which, by the way, the IRS should not release, and for the very same reason Trumps had to be released.
Trump, OTOH, promised to release his returns, so this is just holding him to his word, along with everything else you mentioned.
My argument against that would be that Trump and/or anyone else should not be allowed to get away with lie after lie about planning to release his returns, and why he has not done so yet. It would be a dangerous precedent to set that someone should be allowed to run for and be elected to the most powerful position in the United States while still keeping financial secrets form the voting public.
POTUS works for us. We are not their subjects. Anyone who wants that position but also wants to keep things like their tax records a secret, should just piss off. It'll cost us a few tax evading candidates, but I am confident there will still be plenty of people lining up for the job on both sides of the aisle. Maybe it would scare away billionaires from running. Which is nothing but a plus.
