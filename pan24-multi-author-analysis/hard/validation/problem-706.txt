I think the ability for the Japanese to coordinate with South Korea and Taiwan is more what the recent developments are about anyway.
While Japans's general increased military buildup is no doubt a response to China, I suspect this particular purchase has more to do with North Korea . Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles. If you want something to actually not get intercepted by a near-pear you'd probably want supersonic ballistic missiles.
Unless these are the latest Block V which make up for being a sub-sonic cruise missile by being more stealthy, I suspect it's more so the US getting rid of their older inventory since the US is retiring a lot of their older Tomahawks currently.
US are using block V tomahawks and after that they're likely to retire tomahawk missiles altogether. Not to mention a lot of current US missile destroyers are coming up to decommissioning age and their missiles aren't likely to be installed in the next gen destroyers and frigates.
What I'm concerned about is that Tomahawk missiles are actually pretty old, but still expensive to build (powered by a jet engine), and relatively easy to shoot down with modern anti aircraft weaponry (large radar and IR signature, and relatively slow).
I would think Japan could invent something better for 800m USD... I wonder if this is a good investment...
