"Streisand filed a lawsuit against photographer Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia.com for violation of privacy after his aerial photograph of her mansion featured in the publicly available archive of 12,000 California coastline photographs. Before the $50 million lawsuit was registered, “Image 3850” had been downloaded from his website only six times, two of which were done by Streisand’s lawyers. However, if Adelman had merely jumped the fence, public knowledge of the case obliterated it altogether. The following month, more than 420,000 people visited the archive and downloaded the picture.".
True. Indians have to come out of the victimhood mindset. Look at Vietnam. Buggers were colonised by the French and then attacked by the US. I don't see them complaining a lot.
Didn't Modi go and campaign for Trump before 2020 elections? Or was it the other way around? Too much work for my single brain cell.
Haven't watched the documentary myself. The documentary is about the Godhra riots in the Indian state of Gujarat. The chief minister of Gujarat at that time was Narendra Modi, the current PM of India. He had been widely criticised for his role during the riots. Though many cases were filed against him, the judiciary system has largely maintained that he is not responsible for it. Now the BBC has taken a more critical take on it and Mr. Modi is worried and has sought to ban the documentary.
Me seeing everywhere that Modi wants to shut documentary down and trying to forbid people from watching: Oh we're watching this!
Had the governement banned a documentary when I was at Uni I would have made it my utmost civic duty to watch it. Advertisement doesn't get better than this.
