I often wonder if there will ever be a geopolitical event that India won't in some way blame on the US or UK. I fully expect that in a few years India will claim that the west pressured them to support Russia during its invasion of Ukraine.
The 3 million number was reported by USSR/Pravda in support of India's involvement in the Pakistani civil war (which would have the effect of reducing western influence in the region and advancing the USSR in the cold war).
India was actively aligned with the USSR and supporting one side of the Pakistani civil war to the benefit of the USSR and detriment of the strategic position of the west in the cold war.
What you leave out is that India under Indira Gandhi had aligned itself with the USSR which effectively put India on the geopolitical chessboard on the side of the USSR.
All events have a cause and the US positioning a carrier group in the Bay of Bengal wasn't because the US is a big meanie who doesn't like India and just wanted to take India's lunch money.
"India didn't intervene because the US pressured India not to get involved in an internal Pakistani matter in light of the history of the two nations so it's the US's fault India didn't intervene.".
Bruh. That number is just blatantly false. The H1B program as a whole only has 65k seats/positions available, with an additional 20k for applicants who have completed a degree in the US.
