It's the 21st fucking century. We've got to decide to do something about this. The resulting tragedies of various wars (including the Rwandan Genocide) can be traced directly to this abuse of mass media. After the lessons of WWII of Nazi Germany.
If the entire world hates Russia, and does not trust Russians, it's because they have worked very hard to earn a certain reputation.
It wasn't a moronic position to think that Russia would win at that time, either from a Russian, Ukranian or Western point of view. It was a reasonable assumption. On paper, knowing at least vaguely the amount of raw material, men and money going into the Russian military, a strong enough force to beat Ukraine should have come out of the other end of that black box. Instead, the hatch opened and some kind of gelatinous corrupted ooze dripped out and the rest is history.
I know you're doing poetry here, but to be honest, back when Kherson was taken, everybody knew far far less about the strenh and competence of the Russian military than we do now.
