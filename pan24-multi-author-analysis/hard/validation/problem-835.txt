Putin is basically baiting the Ukranians into a stronghold area where the defenders will have the advantage, and they aren't stupid enough to fall for it.
The Ukrainians are rejecting this as a ploy to set a trap. There has been no real movement of troops out of the area: instead, the Russians are embedding and doubling down with supplies. Putin is basically claiming "Oh Hai everyone we are just leaving and you should too The Ukranians will be here soon oh noes".
The fact that Putin himself is taking the responsibility of telling people to leave the city has me worried. It makes me think he might use a tactical nuke there, or is another commenter mentioned, he might blow the dam and flood that whole area.
Man, I've got a bad feeling about this. Normally these evacuations and retreats happen almost after the fact and Putin never talks about them.
As horrible as blowing that damn would be, I really don't want him to use the tactical nuke. That sends the whole world into uncharted territory, and I don't think I have enough canned food stored up to survive a nuclear winter.
