I always follow that up by agreeing and saying that we as democrats would like to apologize by taking down all the confederate monuments, banning the confederate flag, and giving reparations to black people. Because of how naughty we were.
Oh, no, those are my suggestions for things that democrats can do for being responsible for the civil war that republicans should have no problems with, being the party of Lincoln.
It's like that talking point Republicans like to bring up: Republicans are the party of Lincoln and freed the slaves And democrats led the south in the civil war.
Yeah but see in the 1950s and 60s there was a realignment, and the southern strategy and dixiecrats and... Ah you know what never mind why bother.
edit: The south park episode "Douche and Turd" was in 2004, so yeah long ago already they kind of soured things.
The sense I get is Parker and Stone may kind of regret that too. Based on their call in one of the specials to get out and vote with the 2020 presidential election coming up.
Anyone apparently seriously invoking "both sides" is basically brain damaged or malicious at this point.
