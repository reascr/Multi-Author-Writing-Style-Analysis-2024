Originally, yes, but not so much at this point. The post-war treaties have all been replaced with various mutual defense treaties with the US (among other nations). Japan could choose to build an offensive military at this point, but it would require changing their constitution.
Incidentally, the US actually WANTS the Japanese to amend their constitution to allow a standing army, and they have been lobbying them to do exactly that since 1948. The US sees Japan as a valuable ally and a more armed Japan would be seen as a strategic asset to the US, particularly with Russia and China posing such significant threats to the region.
With how poorly they executed the Ukrainian invasion, and Japan having America's backing (as well as potential help from South Korea), I see a chance that if Russia ttacks Japan, Japan will make Russia its "Special Region".
Or could have just been "Bring me plans for 5 different countries that we could take land from" and some schmuck had to get some generals together to make rudimentary battle plans for Finland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Japan, with hypothetical triggers that wouldn't make Russia look like an idiot.
Declaring war on a major country is stupid idea, but being able to plan a war against any country is probably a good exercice to learn/understand how your own military works, how a country is built (politics, logistics, energy countries and armies work and which weaknesses at every level need to be addressed.
I wouldn't be surprised if the most militaries or intelligence agencies had vague plans about everything you can think of - from helping a country suffering a country-wide disaster to their own allies turning against them like the US did post-WW2.
I suppose I'd rather they spent this much effort into plans to boost up their economy or prevent a pandemic but we often look wholly unprepared !
