Thunder run needs a massive advantage in quality and quantity of armor, so not gonna work here. It worked in kharkiv oblast because there was a lot of open terrain and low density of russian soldiers.
It appeared as though you were talking about kherson itself. Which would not work. Kherson oblast would still not work as well as it did in the east, but would be theoretically possible.
Russia cannot supply Kherson across the river. Russia cannot supply Kherson from the area they control to the East of Kherson, since there is another river and all the bridges there are gone as well.
The Russians may think they can make their great symbolic stand in Kherson. But the supply bandwidth will not be enough to keep military units and civilians alive. After the winter, Kherson will be rubble not because the Ukrainians shelled it, but because the Russians looted and destroyed everything to keep the troops alive. Ukrainians having precision artillery to strike Russian supply again and again will deplete the Russians.
If Ukraine took Kherson, it would have destroyed bridges and there is no good way to push South. Kherson is Dead End City for both sides at this point.
