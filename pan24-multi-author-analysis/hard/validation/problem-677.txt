The Soviet Union had America's number when it came to the space race. The first satellite, first astronaut (both male and female), first space station. But history was more or less remembered that America won the space race by putting a man on the moon.
America's capitalist economy was just superior. They identified the weakness and just outspent them at every turn, declaring more and more expensive projects that drained their coffers until they could no longer match it.
They went from being highly respected in the western sphere for the blood price they paid to end WW2, to ideological enemies of the Cold War.
Tbh, much like America, the Soviets managed to "aquire" some Nazi scientists as they marched to Berlin during the end of WW2. It wouldn't be surprising that, similarly to early NASA, the Soviet space program contained a few of those in their team.
To be fair, there were 14 other countries alongside Russia when the Soviet Union did all their space projects and achievements.
The space effort was done by the USSR, the union that included .... wait for it .... Included engineers from Ukraine, rocket specialists from Kazakhstan, and many former Nazi German rocket scientists and technicians.
The U.S. first rockets were built under the guidance of Werner von Braun, co-develper of the V-2 rocket in WW2. Along with about 1,600 other German former Nazis (see operation Paperclip).
