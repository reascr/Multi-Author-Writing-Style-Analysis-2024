No. It’s not an oversimplification. Businesses are at the mercy of the consumers. Period. People CHOOSE to spend their money with shit companies. Saying otherwise is bullshit. No one needs to shop at Walmart. If you have no money, shop at thrift stores and overstock stores. Cut out processed food & meat. Buy cheap, nonprocessed foods like dry beans, dry rice, discounted fresh produce, dry pasta, canned tomatoes, bulk cheese, etc. It is a myth that poor people can’t afford healthy food. Stop spreading bullshit. And before you say it, I am well aware of food desserts. I have lived in food deserts for most of my adult life. Most folks are just lazy & apathetic. People want everything handed to them.
Ah, there's the "people want everything handed to them" voice. I was wondering when you would show up. I find no conversation is complete without your particularly bitter flavor of self-righteousness.
I still have to drive to work. I cannot afford an electric car. But I can vote for local politicians with plans to increase walkabikity in places, and funding for public transportation. I can continue to volunteer with the Chedapeake Bay Foundation for clean-up and protection of the oyster reefs.
