Two things - Russia didnâ€™t attain air superiority even before western weapons poured into Ukrainian; Russia bombed civilian targets from the very beginning of the war.
So Russia didn't have air superiority over the whole Ukraine, but they were actively blocking Ukrainian air force from doing anything. There were days Ukraine could send 5 sorties and Russia were able to send over 300 that day. Russia could even send T-95s with iron bombs to Mariupol and Ukraine could do nothing about it.
For me this translates into the point, that if we want Ukraine to win this war (quickly), the west should send more AntiAirDefence. It is the least aggressive step, which yields the best results.
Just like the US did in the korean war, where they pretty much leveled the korean peninsula with sheer air power without smart bombs. The only thing that stops them from doing so, are a few SAMs.
They still should be considered capable in air-to-air combat, also if they manage to empty the ukrainian Air Defences, they might have a real shot at stoping the Ukraine from winning this war indefinitely by disrupting supply lines. Because Russia still has very effective ways of "dumb" Air-to-Ground attacks.
But Russia didn't lose their planes to air-to-air kills but to SAMs and Manpads, so their advantage wasn't worth much.
They didn't say modern aircraft, they said more modern aircraft than Ukraine and that is undoubtedly true. Ukraine largely has older variants of Russian/Soviet planes. The main differences being that Russian planes have more effective counter measures vs AA missiles and longer weapon range.
