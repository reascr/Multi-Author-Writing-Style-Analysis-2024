Yep. And in 1917 it was the cossacks turning against the police and joining the people that made the difference. It's really hard to imagine something similar happening in putin's russia.
Personally I can't imagine Russia is going to be demilitarized like the axis powers. It would take multiple significant changes - not least regime change, culture, voluntary de-nuclearlisation (I don't believe this will happen anywhere following several examples including Ukraine itself).
Thanks for sharing. I wouldn't be surprised if the incarceration rates start skyrocketing. Placate the people and contract them out of prison for recycled cannon fodder.
They will be on their own to deal with these issues and even their pre-war thinking and practices toward mental health and law enforcement were hardly progressive. Things will only get worse for Russia.
But why is wishing Russia would "cease to exist" that bad? I mean, personally I don't see what the alternative is, as in it's not gonna be annexed by another country, and it splitting up into multiple countries isn't any help either. But Russia as it is today -should- collapse. Just hope there will be a better Russia to take its place...
