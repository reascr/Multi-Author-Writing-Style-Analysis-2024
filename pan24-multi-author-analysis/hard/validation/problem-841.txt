Trump was a rabid dog that barked. Desantis is a rabid dog that bites. Desantis is worse than Trump by orders of magnitude.
Trump is going to very publicly destroy DeSantis by accusing him of every awful thing Trump has ever done. DeSantis is an absolute dogshit human being, and there is next to zero probability he doesn't have some truly horrible skeletons in his closet and Trump is going to expose them, embellish them, invent them entirely.
And I, for one, am here for it. Fuck both of them. Trump's complete lack of concern for anyone but himself is going to be one hell of an asset. Remember, Trump still thinks he needs to become president again to avoid jail time. He will say or do anything to make that happen. He does not care whatsoever if this scorched earth campaign destroys the GOP or the world, really, for that matter.
DeSantis can't actually punch Trump too hard. If he actually attacks Trump, it will have to be for things that DeSantis is either guilty of himself or has previously defended Trump for. Trump will retaliate for every perceived slight with the most heinous shit we've ever heard.
