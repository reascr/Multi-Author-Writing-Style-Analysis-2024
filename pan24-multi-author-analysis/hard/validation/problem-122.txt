Which is not at all something I’d agree with, fwiw, as I linked there’s good reason to think wages go up as a result of immigration, but you can pick your poison I suppose.
I have very good news, which is that immigrants don’t drive down wages for native workers, and probably increase wages for natives. Check out comment I made to another reply. It addresses housing too, which is a separate issue.
Of course not, but immigration has enough benefits for everyone involved to make it worthwhile to ensure you’re building enough housing, which again, you have to do anyway.
Re: housing, I am suggesting that Canada desperately needs to build more housing in any case, so immigration is a drop in the demand bucket so to speak.
2-If we don't have enough housing but we keep increasing the number of people in need of it, there can only be one inevitable result. That's just common sense. And look! That's exactly what happened and now we're all grabbing our ankles while the BoC tries to address a separate but related issue.
