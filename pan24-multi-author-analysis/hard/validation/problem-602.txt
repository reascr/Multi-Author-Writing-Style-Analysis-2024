It has been available for men also for a time, but there was a masculine taboo about using it for a whils,so a very good look when our defence minister takes the leave also!
Also, another quirk here is that he must formally resign as defense minister, but not as MP, as the law doesn´t recognize ministerial leave as such. He will be reappointed to the position by his party, although this is by convention and not required.
Minister Kaikkonen is using his maximum allowed paternity leave, as his child was born before september 2022.
For anyone wondering, fathers in finland are for children born before september 2022, entitled to 54 days of paid paternity leave, with maximum of 18 days at the same time as the mother. Mothers were entitled to 105 days of maternity leave, which could start 30 days before the due date. This was followed by 154 days of care leave, which could be used by either father or mother, to be used before the child is 2.
Starting for children born from September 2022 onwards, there is 30 days of pregnancy leave, followed by paid parenting leave for both parents of 160 days. Either parent can shift 63 of those days to the other parent.
Also also, during this parliament, our finance minister, education minister, environment minister and basic services minister have all used maximum amount of paid leave allowed, but as they are women it didnt make the news. (Why yes, this government is lead by women under 40, why do you ask?).
Yes. I’m an expecting first-time-mother, and this is all I will be offered after birthing my baby. 12 weeks unpaid leave “job security” under FMLA. Came here to add that many people don’t take all 12 weeks because we simply can’t afford it.
