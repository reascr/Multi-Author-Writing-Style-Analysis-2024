Don't be surprised. There's no such thing as the news today. It's all parasitic mass media companies creating stretched truths to scare everyone in to clicking.
So Putin will convince them to join the war, a large chunk of their male population will be killed, and then there will be no one to start a resistance when Russia takes Belarus.
Yeah i give then a 25 % chance invading ukraine, a 25% chance joining ukraine and foght russia and a 90 % chance to kill Lukaschenko... (i know more than 100% but they can still fight russia afterwards).
If Belarussians people put up with this shit and basically kill themselves for Putin i don't even....
Oooh so that's the plan, good ol' russian throw so many lives at the problem until the souls of the dead curse them into submission...
Hopefully that's the case and the people have actual balls unlike russians(i swear for all their depiction of being hardy and strong, russians always let their rulers systematically kill them without any fight)...
It recently came out that Lukashenko esentially sold Belarus to Russia when they helped him stay in power some time ago sooo...
Belarus is a semi-puppet state of Russia, with the unpopular dictator Lukashenko being kept in power by Russians military might. As a Russian puppet state, Russians keeps publicly trying to get Belarus to send their troops into Ukraine, but that would be extremely unpopular to the Belarusian population. So Lukashenko keeps making anti-Ukraine and anti-NATO noises to placate Putin, while at the same time doing everything he can to find and loudly talk about excuses to not actually send their troops into Ukraine.
