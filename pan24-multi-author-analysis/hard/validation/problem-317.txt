Somewhat more seriously, in the past decade we've seen a lot of problems with countries that try to go it on their own, Brexit created a lot of problems, Trump created a lot of problems, Russia is politically isolated while everyone has Ukraine's back, the importance of NATO has been clearly demonstrated.... Like, these things go in cycles, obviously, and it would be dumb of me to presume that this cycle is finished (can cycles be "finished?") but I do still see some signs for hope.
And before you ask, no, I don't like it when the United States does it either. Still, an imperfect return to Brexit is better than being out in the cold, I can both like the idea of Britain rejoining the EU and wish they would get the full fat version.
You also forget that when the UK was finally allowed in the situation was different, now the bloc has more people and more economic power, the UK has like for Brexit, no leverage.
Do not forget that the UK was denied membership twice before they were finally accepted at a time where the economic benefits were greater than it would be today.
I'm not saying the UK should get any special treatment next time, just saying why there's still a reason the EU would consider giving the UK exemptions.
It would not be political tenable for the different EU constituent to accept the UK back with all their privileges.
It's not like the UK government was in a position to dictate Scotland's membership of the EU post-independence.
Particularly after the safety of Scotland's position within the EU had been a central tenent of the anti-independence campaign in 2014.
