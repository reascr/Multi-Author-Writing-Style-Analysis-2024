Yeah, another one of those headlines asking a question where the answer should be "no," but this is apparently the best plan people in charge could come up with. Of course.
"Let's throw more responsibilities at an underfunded without any additional money, and make sure to get as many police involved as possible. Hey, it worked great for our public schools, right?".
Or. Or. Or. maybe we should just send the cops to take the ones who survive their first encounter with the cops off to jail so we don’t have to see them anymore. That would be on brand.
No. It’s not. A human boot with a gun, god complex, and anger issues do not need to respond to mental health crisis.
Maybe the solution is building a comprehensive welfare state with a functional public health system that can get people housed and in treatment programs that will hopefully help them stabilize, find employment, and participate in society.
It’s to build a mental health infrastructure that can meet the needs of the mentally ill with clinical support (therapists), supportive housing with case management, and medication assistance.
