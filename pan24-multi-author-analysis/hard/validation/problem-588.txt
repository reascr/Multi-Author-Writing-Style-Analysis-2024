Not in the slightest. The only constitutional freedom they’ve ever championed is gun ownership. Aside from that, they’ve as of late tried to paint themselves as pro free speech but that’s very deceptive. They don’t like when people experience consequences from saying things many others find offensive(aka cancel culture), but they are all for using the power of government to limit or block the exercise of speech in the first place. This library is a prime example.
I used to work for a Library system. Before I worked there, I was told of the dark days when the "Crazies" were up in arms about a local newspaper we carried and had available called the Blade, which was aimed at the Gay community. It had ads for hookups in the back. They showed up to Library meetings, picketed a few Libraries, made a spectacle for about a year.
In the end, they lost steam and burned out, stopped doing what they were doing. I see now, they are back. Its cyclical. These people get bent out of shape over anything gay and think its Satan taking over. Ride it out, they'll lose steam.
