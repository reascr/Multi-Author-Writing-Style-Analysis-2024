Saudi Arabia is pretty safe. I have relatives there who aren’t naive to Saudi and nothings happened to them. Honestly most of the Middle East is safe for Westerners and you’ll get on without many issues if you use a little common sense and respect the local laws/norms.
Before we go on any further i want to make clear that I’m not defending Saudi Arabia here but being misleading about the actual situation with generalized statements only serves to make it easier for them to vilify and demonize those who are against them.
I’ve had female American and Canadian teachers from the high school I went to in Kuwait that went there without issues. Honestly, if you aren’t going out in short shorts, crop and/or sleeveless tops you’ll likely be left to your own devices in SA as a foreigner visiting. There’s several valid criticisms to make about Saudi Arabia, the idea that you’re going to be unsafe as a foreign woman there isn’t one of them tbh.
While I agree that the offenses people get executed for in Saudi Arabia are outrageous, that is not the crux of the issue. The capital punishment in itself is the most inhumane part. When advocating for the death penalty you have to accept at least one of these statements: The state is either never wrong, or that executing innocent people is an unfortunate but accepted fact of this system.
Most countries do not punish murderers or any/most other crimes by death, so why is it ok for the US to execute prisoners, but not other countries? The US also routinely tortures prisoners held indefinitely without trial in Guantanamo bay, I don't think the US has any moral high ground to stand on when it comes to capital punishment.
Don’t forget that the American now jail people indefinitely without trial. They even kill them with drone based only on the pattern of their movements.
