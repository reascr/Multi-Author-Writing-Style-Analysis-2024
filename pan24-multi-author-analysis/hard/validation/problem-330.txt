Always in the top ten producers over the last decade or so, and they outproduce us (Australia) the last few years, with nearly double the output. They're around about the same production as France and Germany.
(Of course, the bastardry and madness of the Australian gas market - one of the largest in gas fields in the world! - is also affect by this war...but that's another rant.).
Zelensky's smart, contextualising the war for those who (think they) aren't directly affected by it.
Zelenskyy doesn’t have to keep pointing out how it affects the rest of the world — but he does. He isn’t afraid to keep shaming the world but also waking them up with facts. A great leader, in my opinion.
He gets publicity because he’s a great leader trying to keep his country alive against a tyrant. Person of the year isn’t always a good thing. It’s just whoever made the most headlines that year. Hitler, Stalin, and even Bin Laden were all Person’s of the Year. I can’t see anything off with a man going to every measure to protect the country he loves. He either gets what he needs, or the entire country dies.
