The "dispute" over Gibraltar is nationalistic nonsense, it's pulled out whenever populists need to grandstand, but it's not a serious political issue. Gibraltar is British and will remain so for as long as Britain exists, and Spain is fully aware of that.
As long as Spain has something to gain from having the UK in the EU, which it does, then British sovereignty over Gibraltar won't even be part of the conversation outside of the media.
... Because the reclamation of Gibraltar has always been a big part of UK-Spain relations, Spain giving up their 1 chance to have Britain by the balls and actually have the leverage to maybe get Gibraltar back isn't going to happen.
And the UK could rejoin (if everyone agreed and they gave up all the special statuses they had before) they don't mean they could just rejoin without the consent of members xd.
You seem like you literally know nothing about European relations and are just saying "but anything could happen!".
It's more than that. It's a tax haven where many British businesses are registered. Many of those businesses have undue influence on our government. The EU is making efforts to close tax loopholes; in order for the UK to rejoin, Gibraltar would need to start complying.
As a Brit I'm fine with both of those. British exceptionalism needs putting in its place and we will all be the better for it. I want to be part of a union where everyone is treated equally.
