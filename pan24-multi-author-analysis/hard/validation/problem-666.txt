Gets better, I looked it up because my recollection was fuzzy. Turns out they are using old nuke cruise missiles with the warhead replaced with ballast. They are running seriously low on missiles. Fuck Russia.
Interesting that you bring up the wave/echelon attacks. A Reddit comment lead me to this really interesting video that shows how a culture of lying and papering over short comings is what leads to this lemming like behavior. And, even though top leadership knows they are being bullshitted they go along with it, because Russian doctrine depends on mathematical models that are only as good as the information they plug in. And as long as your math shows your call is the correct one, and you have the receipts to show that the information you got is what you plugged in, you aren't held responsible. It is hard baked into their military culture to send men into meat grinders...
It's possible that they don't have warheads to place on them. No clue if they were designed to convert to conventional munitions. My best guess is at the very least they might help real munitions reach their target by overwhelming defense systems, but even then it shows that they need as many to connect as possible, if they had enough to spare they'd use live ones since some of thier inert ones are getting through and doing minimal damage.
I heard on NPR yesterday that in the latest barrages there were rockets with inert warheads on them mixed in. Russia is (l think) claiming its to throw off defensive systems by overwhelming them...but it could also be indicative of them running low on warheads to attach to rocket bodies.
Non-precision weapons are battlefield weapons, not the kind that fly hundreds of miles to attack power plants and substations far behind the front lines.
It doesn't matter how many rockets they toss at targets, they won't destroy power plants and substations in worrying numbers away from the frontlines which is what they've been trying to do.
