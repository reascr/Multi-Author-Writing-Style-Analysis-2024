>“Morocco has had enough of double standards,” Abdelmajid Fassi Fihri, of the Istiqlal Party, told AFP. He deplored the fact that the European Parliament had not condemned attacks on press freedom in Algeria.
Except the EU has called out Algeria on its deteriorating freedom of press conditions several times in the past. "It's double standard/but what about that other country, they do it too" is usually just a way from the country in question to deflect.
Notice how Morocco doesn't even deny it, they're just angry that they were put in the spotlight. Typical for authoritarian regimes i guess. Don't fall for their propaganda tricks.
The EU isn't selective, they've called out Algeria in the past as well. Morocco is deflecting from themselves, it's just political posturing.
Also it's a non-binding resolution, the EU didn't pass or enforce a law. It's just a resolution that formally recognizes the current state of press freedoms in Morocco.
That said, the media freedom in Morocco is definitely a serious issue and vital, though it is mostly internal.
