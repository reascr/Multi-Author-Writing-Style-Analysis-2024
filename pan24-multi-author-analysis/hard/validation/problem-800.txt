Ukraine is obviously motivated, and their forces have demonstrated that they have been able to adapt to Western tactics and weapons quickly, so what's holding back support?
I think people feel that if the US and allies just gave Ukraine what they were asking for, the war would be over by now.
That the war would be over if Ukraine got all the weapons they wanted? That the war wouldn't be over if they got all the weapons they wanted? That we should give Ukraine more weapons? That we shouldn't give Ukraine more weapons? That sending weapons to Ukraine is a good investment? That sending weapons doesn't significantly impact our force readiness? Or something else entirely?
"The same could be happening for Ukraine. Even if Ukraine takes back all of its territory it doesnt mean that the war is over, it wouldn't surprise me if we end up in a situation where we have years worth of missiles being thrown at eachother and skirmishes at wherever borders lie at the time.".
Eh. It's unlikely, but a good outcome would be a RF collapse and the independence of many minority groups who have had to endure under the Russians for far too long.
Yes, Putin go all in, he already a old man and whatever happend to russia in future is not his problem soon, maybe some of russian minority regions want to break out?
Putin is dragging Russia to a point that eventually the country itself may break up further just like Yugoslavia did.
I believe that if Ukraine takes back all their territory, Putin is going to lose power and Russia will be too busy fighting internal struggles to do anything about Ukraine.
