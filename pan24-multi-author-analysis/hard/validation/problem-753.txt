Wildcat strikes are not out of the question if this passes without the sick days being added. Congress may be playing with fire here, and we've already seen parts of the GOP use this to undercut the Democrats.
Just like we watched Democrats constantly get blamed for Republicans filibusters for the last couple years. Or how one Democrat voting against something made it the Democrats fault if it didn't pass, but every single Republican could also not vote against that and they caught none of the blame.
Also, You know every bit as well as I do that it will be blamed entirely on Democrats. There's too much actual thinking that has to be done in order to come to the conclusion that it's solidly the company's fault, and after the last several years we all should know better that that's not what most people are going to do.
It was only 2 years ago that Republicans attempted to overthrow our government and install a one-party system, and since then they were rewarded by being given back one half of Congress. I'm going to stick by that quote.
That was YOUR quote. I'm not "making a lot of claims" or "assuring you that (the Republicans) aren't much of a concern" or "gambling" or doing any of the other things you've accused me of doing.
