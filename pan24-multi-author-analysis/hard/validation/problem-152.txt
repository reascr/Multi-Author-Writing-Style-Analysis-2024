Had my first (& only) child 2 years ago & promptly left Florida for a more rational state. That place is a dumpster fire in all respects. Only going to get worse.
It's going to get worse. They are currently training teachers on a computer program where the kids will teach them themselves and the teachers only monitor the students. No hands on anything.
So sorry I wasted money on my elementary education degree because there are no school systems teaching in a research-based way these days.
He is absolutely correct too. I have a relative who works in Duval county, and classroom library shelves are empty or covered in the elementary grades. They are only allowed to use the books that come with the state curriculum. The county doesn't want to risk getting in trouble and let's face it, what teacher wants to get felony charged or lose their license over this.
Even if itâ€™s right, this teacher will be stripped of his teaching license, and probably have his house swatted in front of his family and be arrested.
