Diplomacy requires patience, negotiation, trust etc. and to throw early communications at the ravenous, dishonest media is an amateur move for a world leader, especially considering the amount of people who are at risk of being affected by trade sanctions China could levy if relations sour....it happened in Australia and whole industries were decimated.
I get everyone on Reddit hates China, but it's weak sauce for Trudeau to frame leaking diplomatic communications as promoting democracy and freedom, such a naive north American response.
I understand hating the Chinese government and authoritarian regimes, but keep an eye on how anything China themed goes over on Reddit.
I don’t see much general anti-Chinese sentiment on Reddit. There’s always one guy that’s openly hateful, but there’s also always that one person being vile about everyone and everything so I don’t feel like we’re being specially mistreated. Most of the criticism I’ve seen IS about their authoritarian government, the Uyghur camps, foreign interference, etc. And most of the people I see getting offended by that are people who can’t separate Chinese cultural identity from those things, so I feel like they are the problem.
It often spills over and becomes a general hatred of the people/culture/all things China because most people don't have the nuance to separate Government from Nation.
