"Affordable high density housing" that blocked Tesla expansion in Fremont had homes at a million each. These are not ranch homes, they are stacked on one another. Toll Bros made a ton of money on them. Many buyers are living one family per bedroom (extended families), not one family per house.
How many New Yorkers are currently crammed into 2-3 bedroom units with roommates? How much does it cost to actually live alone? Building like Tokyo doesn't just mean building smaller housing. It means building abundant housing. Build so much of it that a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan built after 2000 costs $1500 a month to live in.
This is a small part of the overall problem, which is a housing supply shortage. Companies that buy single-family homes to rent out only do so in markets where zoning laws create artificial scarcity. Make it legal to build large amounts of new housing and you get rid of that artificial scarcity propping up home prices.
Affordable housing as in what a corroboration will take over and hike the rent. Buts thatâ€™s only because it will put money into the politicians pockets.
