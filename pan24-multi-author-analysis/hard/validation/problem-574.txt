The basics: ‘sex’ is your biological features of penis, vagina, etc and determined by genetics of XX for female and XY for male. Generally male and female, but genetics are weird and you can have genes move around and get intersex people who have various combinations of sex organs.
We have bimodal sexes (mostly male or female with some variation due to genetic anomalies), this is important for sexual reproductive.
Intersex has to do with chromosomes and the genitalia and other sexual dimorphism features that develop after birth. Intersex is not a gender identity it is a biologic sexual assignment. In rare cases, a person with XY chromosomes develops as a female because a male determining factor gene was incorrectly copied (not copied at all) onto the Y chromosome during crossover at fertilization. This happens Vice versa too where an XX people as well, where the Y determine allele gets incorrectly copied onto the X chromosome.
It’s not really a separate sex so much as a genetic coding error. If it was a separate, third sex there would be some reproductive or evolutionarily adaptive value to it, but that’s not the case. Everything is some combo of X and/or Y, but 99% of the time it conforms to the binary.
