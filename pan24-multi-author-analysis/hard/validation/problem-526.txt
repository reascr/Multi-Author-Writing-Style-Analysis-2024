But there was no need for the chancellor to hurry and be the first foreign visitor after Xi's renewal of power with the terrible removal of his predecessor. Saying this as a German.
I am German to. From my perspective waiting to not be the first to meet with China is just childish. We need them and they for now at least still need us. I really hope that over the next few years the government decides to really push for a withdrawal from China at least partly. We can’t let ourselves be blackmailed into standing by and watching all the shit they do.
I agree they are sending some mixed messages and as a German it’s very annoying but as I voted for one of the coalition members I still have hope that they will do the sensible thing.
I like how everybody is judging Olaf for this even tho it’s very normal for two countries to meet when they do so much business. The strategy for the future is changing but for now Germany still relies on China. This needs to change but until then this is what needs to be done. The coalition is Germany has more or less agreed to dealing with China differently.
That’s what they are doing isn’t it? What do you imagine the change will look like? We may see them more as an adversary and a competitor but in the end we will still do business with them. No one is going to fully pull out of China.
