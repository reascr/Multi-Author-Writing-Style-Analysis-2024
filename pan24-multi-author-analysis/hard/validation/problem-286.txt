In part that’s because a Sanders Presidency, if by some miracle he’d won, would likely have been a lame duck presidency from the very beginning. Democrats can’t even unite behind the relatively inoffensive and status quo supporting blandness or Joe Biden - there’s no hope whatsoever that Bernie would have been more successful in my opinion.
Six months ago I would've thought the Dems should start prepping a different candidate, but after a strong showing in the midterms, and the lack of an obvious strong alternative, I think Biden could do well with a second term.
Personally if I was Biden I'd announce like right now "I will not be running for re-election, instead I will use my remaining time as president to do as much good as I possibly can I encourage the DNC to have a strong, robust primary, and I will refrain from being involved in the primary process".
If Biden was stumbling through his presidency, looking overwhelmed by the dynamics of the situations and struggling to do anything, absolutely I'd say he shouldn't run.
But the dude is coming off the most successful two years of any presidency lately, including a semi-successful midterm. He's proven good at his job, so his age isn't much a concern for me.
Biden openly denied the suggestion he would only serve one-term if elected. So, if you're frustrated, that's on you believing something that was never seriously mentioned beyond one Politico article from 2019 that Biden denied anyway.
