I'm not too sure about that. I remember in the opening days of the war when the Ukrainians realized that Russian tanks were coming to kill them all. All the men went away to war, then I saw a video of local musicians that had gathered in the park to entertain a large crowd of women, children, and the elderly, who were all preparing food and singing songs as they all worked together to prepare thousands of Molotov cocktails for their unwelcome guests. It was then that I knew that Ukraine could never be defeated.
Russia cant defeat the WEST on the battlefield. Just dont forget who kept you alive Zelenskyy. Without that massive amount of support Ukraine would be Putins puppet state by now.
If Russia takes all of Ukraine. The next one would be a nato county and I am willing to see what happens. You can’t say the west didn’t do some provoking. Well here we are. Nato and the west broke a lot of agreements made and the current Russia is not the old USSR. Russia tried to join NATO a few times and they wouldn’t let them. Christianity is exploding in Russia and the west is mad they overthrew their control gained during the Bolshevik Revolution. Also, I don’t think there is any government worth fighting for on the planet so yea. I mean Putin is so bad they are making money hand over fist, Have a strong currency, and have Christian values. They are so terrible. My point is ever country has done really bad things and justified it. I don’t think Russia is the demon everyone makes them out to. Let’s talk. Vietnam, Korea, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan. I guess China can’t do any wrong. A US Russia Alliance would basically control the world and support Christian values. That’s what I would do. Peace through strenh.
Right, unfortunately life isn’t fair. I don’t want to give any more arms or money to Ukraine. I don’t want to get nuked because of Ukraine. Ukraine pretty much started it by committing crimes against Russian speaking people. It’s messy both sides are at fault. Why would Russia let Ukraine on its border join NATO. That is a violation on the Minsk agreement by the west and one of Russias red lines. Hence the situation we are in. Ukraine will be losing land it’s just a matter of how much will be left.
And the UK and US bombed the pipelines going to Germany. I don’t support that either. The US and Nato bombed Iraq to the dark ages and killed millions of civilians. What is so special about Ukraine? Why do they have to have every inch back. I don’t support Russia but it’s the civilians that suffer. I mean the Current Ukraine govern is and has been very corrupt. My point is both sides won’t get everything they want but it needs to stop.
If you look at it Ukraine is not ready for winter combat. Russia has taken the gloves off when Ukraine hit the bridge. That was civilian infrastructure. I am not taking sides. I would like both of them to sit down and hash it out to end the war. Russia is probably the better equipped for military action in the winter. All civilians lose in war. We should had our politicians weapons and tell them to go fight it out.
