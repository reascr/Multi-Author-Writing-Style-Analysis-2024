Russian civilians would always say flat out that they think america is misguided and that they think Putin did a good job controlling Trump and us politics. Under obama, they were always under threat of strikes or sanctions if they made any moves on ukraine and could not make a move.
Trump's primary use for russia (in russian minds at least), wasn't to make us politics a primary shitshow, it was a primary objective to cause enough chaos to prepare for a war to invade ukraine without the threats or sanctions Obama or Biden or even Bush or any past non compromised president would have made.
The U.S. has been increasing tensions with Russia and attempting to provoked into a military conflict and now this is the narrative to justify it.
If we back down in the face of Russian aggression, we signal that the US, and more broadly the UN, no longer has the will to enforce that basic idea that borders as drawn by the UN are immovable. This would likely start a feeding frenzy. Since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, China has been remarkably belligerent when it comes to Taiwan, going so far to threaten Nancy Pelosi on her visit there. If we back down from Russia, I can guarantee that China will take a shot at claiming Taiwan.
