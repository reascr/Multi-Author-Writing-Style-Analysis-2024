Hate to disappoint folks, but using a robot to deliver deadly force has been an option for law enforcement, nationwide, for years now.
The San Francisco Police Department said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.
Putting an explosive charge on a robot and blowing up the barricaded Dallas subject was the only way to kill him without putting additional police in extreme danger, given the unique and exigent circumstances of that particular case.
The precedent for a robot to to deliver deadly force was created in 2016 with the Dallas shooter, who had killed 5 cops, and barricaded himself in a parking garage where he could not be safely approached by police or reached with an armored vehicle. He was on the phone with negotiators saying "come and get me, so I can kill more of you".
