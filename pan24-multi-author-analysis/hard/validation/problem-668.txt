It's all part of the ongoing right wing scheme to delegitimize the entire concept of governance and set us back to the Gilded Age.
Their entire messaging machine is built around the idea that the government is incapable of getting anything done, which they then make self-fulfilling prophecy by refusing to do anything when they're in office.
They have spent so much time being obstructionist and critical of the Dems that they have completely forgotten how to govern, and the people they have gotten elected are completely incapable of governing (e.g. Boebert, Gaetz, MTG, etc.).
2. Uninformed Older voters who don't know what's going on in the world at all b/c they have no real source of truth in their lives. All of their pain meds probably don't help their critical thinking.
3. Those who clearly see the GOP as the White Christian Nationalist party that it has become and which they support.
It seems plainly obvious that the GOP has no interest in leading and are only interested in the perks and privileges allotted to them for being in charge.
I really wish that the older generations were more inclined to critical thinking and could see through all of the lies and stories they're told by conservative media sources.
