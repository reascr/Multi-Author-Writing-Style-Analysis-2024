Its a combination of materials and secrets. Nuclear technology is very much at the top of the “tech tree”—you need to be able to source basically everything from inside your own country. Gas centrifuges used to enrich the uranium require very careful engineering or they will shake themselves apart. They also spin very very fast so they make them from a high tensile strenh steel called marraging steel. If you can’t make or acquire this steel then you don’t have centrifuges. This is just one example out of a million in the line from raw uranium to weapons grade.
U-233 exists and is technically weapons grade, can be created via the thorium fuel cycle but has its own set of hurdles. U-238 can also undergo fission in the right circumstances, mainly fast and high energy neutron flux generated from a fusion reaction. In the case of modernish thermonuclear weapons, 40%+ of the total energy released can come from the U-238 bomb case and other components.
The hard part of making nuclear weapons is the enrichment of the uranium or plutonium. It takes a long time for the "inputs" to go through the facility and come out on the other end as the enriched "outputs", on the order of six months to a year. This is how weapons inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) work. They turn up randomly every few months, too fast for an end-to-end run of enrichment to get to weapons-grade purity.
Iran previously tried to make a "run" to weapons grade uranium, but the US attacked their plant with a computer virus called Stuxnet and imposed severe sanctions. Seriously, go read up about that virus, it's an amazing story all by itself. The US managed to smuggle it into a network protected by an air gap by leaving infected USB sticks in nearby campuses!
... to order tens of billions of dollars worth of Boeing planes and parts, something that was blocked by sanctions previously.
