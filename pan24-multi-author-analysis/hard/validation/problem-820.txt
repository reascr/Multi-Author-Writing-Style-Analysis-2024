Like, this does need to be said also.... If you are a white, straight, cis dude under the age of 50 or 60, and these fascists fucks take power; it will directly effect you in your lifetime.
Like, Martin Niemoller, of the "First they came" poem, was a protestant minister that was the wrong sect of protestantism in a largely protestant fascist project. If they win and no longer have to worry about opposition; even if the tension of possible civil war between left and right goes away; they will still drag the country into a civil war as they turn on each other, and it will not be pretty. More than likely, they will chop the U.S. into pieces to better control (as smaller sovereiy is inherently easier to control and use to oppress) and sink into a sort of cold religious war as they force entire swaths of regions to convert to their specific brand or die.
I mean, if you have friends who are LGBT or POC, or women, then yeah; the outcome of your life depends on it. Those folks might not be there or be able to interact with you in the same way.
You know who protestants/evangelicals hate more than gays, POC, trans people and women? Catholics. You know who catholics hate more than those things? Protestants/evangelicals. It's harder to tell with the protestants because they're more decentralized, but you can see how it is with how the extreme catholics talk amongst themselves about Vatican II. They fucking hate that they ceded their claim to supreme authority in order to find common cause with other sects of Christianity and remain politically relevant. They fucking hate that they revoked blaming all Jews for the death of Jesus. Evangelicals hate that its Leonard Leo picking supreme court seats and Newt Gingrich and Sean Spicer and all those fucks make pilgrimages to the Vatican. Paul Gosar denounced the pope for "trendy socialist speak.".
This is the point I was trying to make. If you wanna be an asshole and fuck over everyone who isn't a cishet white male, I don't know how to convince you that you should care about other people except to say I hope you're treated with the same kindness.
