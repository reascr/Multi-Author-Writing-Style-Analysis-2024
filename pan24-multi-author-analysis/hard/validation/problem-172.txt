He is the only old politician I would recommend voting for again despite his age. Other than that every country in the world need to replace old politicians with younger ones that bring new ideas and ideology.
Not from US but while I would prefer younger people in politics no matter what country, Joe Biden have been an amazing president actually getting shit done.
Look, I voted for Biden, and I really like the way he's running the country at the moment. I think he's doing a good job.
That said, I feel that younger people might have reservations about voting for someone that old. It's important to have a candidate who is relatable, and Biden might just not appeal to younger voters in 2024.
I'm progressive AF, and I don't want Biden to run again- but that is only because his age is a liability.
Sadly, I think Biden wanted to be retired. He probably still wants to retire. But the question is if not him, who?
That being said, Biden has been an extremely effective President for the government he was given. If it weren't for the fact that he'd be 81 come inauguration day, I would have no issue saying run again where I'd donate and vote enthusiastically. But even there, I will donate and vote enthusiastically because fuck Trump, DeSantis, or whatever bozo the Republicans nominate.
