“Officers” should be a category on the daily and total losses pictographs a couple sources publish. Right next to “helicopters” and “special equipment”.
A small squad with javelins and drones are able to have an outsized influence on a modern battlefield.
Now, we have drones that can tell us when an enemy soldier sneezes or ties his shoes. How in the world did Russia manage to lose 20 generals in less than a year?
Russia has lost twice as many men then America lost in the 10 years of the Vietnam War. Their losses are comparable to American losses in World War 1. We joined WW1 about a year and a half before the end and had similar losses to Russia's losses this past year.
I just wish I saw more push-back in Russia. Russia has a population of 140-150 million. World War 2 had 9% of the American population serving in some capacity. Even splitting those that served with 10% in combat and 90% logistics your already up near 1.5 million fighting conscripts. I just don't want to assume they can't reach those historic percentages. Worst case scenario, Russia could keep this up for a long time. There are very good reasons against this scenario but they come with assumptions.
It's not that Russia is strong or they will win, I just don't see the breaking point. My priors would have had Russia's forces collapsing months ago. I'm wary of counting them out, despite everything.
Wager has stopped prison recruiting but the army still is. What's to stop Putin from forcibly mobilizing prisoners? Or Sending police with quotas to frame innocents and ship them to war? We already have seen it in occupied territories. He seems to be content with half measures that slowly bleed Russia dry but prevent widespread dissent.
