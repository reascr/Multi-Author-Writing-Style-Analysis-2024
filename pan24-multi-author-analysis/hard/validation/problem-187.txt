The DNC is making this the first stop of the primaries because they now see it as a safe place to give corporate Dems an early boost. If they start in a place like California or NY then they run the real risk of progressives becoming front runners with an insurmountable lead.
Yeah, the media effectively declared a Biden win despite South Carolina not being reflective of the electorate.
Itâ€™s also way bigger - Biden got more votes in SC than Bernie did in the previous three states combined - but those states gave people a false sense of who could win.
Some might think this is a clue that Biden is running but honestly I think it's the opposite. It's a sign he might not run. If Biden runs, he'll do it unopposed and not have to worry about primaries at all. But if he doesn't run, there'll be a contentious primary, and SC favors Biden's more moderate side as it did in 2020. So someone like Harris or Buttigieg could run and do well early for instance.
The party can cancel primaries if they want to for him, as the GOP did for Trump. There's really no risk. Newsom and Sanders already said they're not running against him, and there's no other serious challenger. I guess it could be added protection, but I think it's more about if he doesn't run.
