imagine if Democrats demanded Congress to eliminate tax cuts passed in the last legislative session in order to keep the nation out of default.
Why don't Democrats introduce a fallback bill that does a clean debt limit increase, and when things start to come down to the wire see if there are 5 sane Republicans willing to vote with them to pass it?
In late 2021 Schumer refused to give into McConnell’s demands (similar to what House Republicans are doing now) and once the deadline was right around the corner McConnell ended up being forced to back down and Democrats raised the debt limit without strings attached. He even went as far as to agreeing to a temporary filibuster exemption so that Democrats can raise the debt ceiling on their own. When it comes to fighting for a clean raise of the debt ceiling Democrats aren’t as incompetent as you think.
They will once the deadline actually gets closer. They have until June, no need to rush now. Especially since as the deadline gets closer moderate republicans will start to feel the heat from their donors and will be more willing to negotiate.
Is that really true? I must’ve forgot when Democrats beat McConnell when he pulled the same shit in 2021.
