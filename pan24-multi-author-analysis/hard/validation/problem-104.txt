Because they could just leave it alone and focus on real issues. Also, how about just letting go of the idea that “business attire” somehow means a suit and tie.
Men have to wear a suit and tie, always have. Slacks, dress shoes, that sort. If you're not in that attire the supreme court, regular court, state courts, etc would have you removed.
You actually can. Have you ever shopped cheap? Just curious. Just go to any second hand clothing store for most of it, pick up a 40 dollar jacket off some discount rack. Done.
A Missouri representative makes more than an average Missourian does. You can go and get slacks, a shirt, shoes and a jacket for under 100 dollars assuming you buy cheap and actively try to save money. Most employers require more than that for employees. If we're going to cry about price, then remove the damn steel toed requirement for most manufacturing jobs because my boots cost more than a cheap suit does.
Where the f- do you work that your employer isn't offering at least a partial price match for your boots? Have you ever looked through their handbook?
