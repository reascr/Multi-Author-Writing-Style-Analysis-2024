“The Democrats could end this now by voting for the guy who said he was going to bludgeon Nancy Pelosi with a hammer right before someone actually DID try and bludgeon Nancy Pelosi with a hammer.”.
No, thank you. The GOP doesn’t want to help to Democrats on things so simple as making sure the people they represent don’t die easily preventable deaths, so why should the Democrats have to solve the GOP’s own pointless infighting?
Cause I'm sick of people lumping the accomplishments of 98% of Democrats with the intentions of two problem people as a lame-ass excuse to "bOtH sIdEs" this shit.
Here's the thing, if Democrats put in decades of work and political will behind helping a group that's +10 R then they're not fucking helping their voters. If you aren't helping your voters why would your voters give you credit.
While there are some that can look at it and say the world is a better place. There are others that will say it's pointless since I'm still getting fucked by the same system you're protecting them from.
