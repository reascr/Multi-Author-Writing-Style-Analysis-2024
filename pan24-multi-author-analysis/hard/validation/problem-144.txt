Asteroids are waaaaaay more economically viable to mine, and we already have the technology to mine them.
Getting to Mars is a matter of human achievement and research opportunities. There are virtually no economic drivers to reaching Mars or building a base, but we'll do it anyways. There was no economic driver for the initial missions to the moon either.
Ok but you also can't move planets closer to earth. Commercial mining of asteroids would involve first bringing them into earth's orbit, which is actually quite straightforward. We already have all the technology to mine asteroids, it's just not economically viable yet. Meanwhile even getting to Mars, let alone setting up mining colonies is going to be a massive undertaking.
Probably a bunch of gold and other metals on Mars too. Why not? There might not be as much since Mars is smaller and less dense than Earth, but that doesn't mean there's none.
Mars is in space you can literally see it in the sky sometimes, like the Moon which is also in space.
There's a lot of similarities between Earth and Mars, but Mars is like a dystopian, dead and fucked up version of Earth.
Basically, the atmospheric pressure doesn't really matter because it's too cold for the water ice to sublime anyway.
