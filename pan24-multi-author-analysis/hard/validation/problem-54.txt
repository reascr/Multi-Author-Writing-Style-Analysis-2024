You’d have to be crazy to not consider a few plausible options, Luke Russian rigging some kind of dirty bomb that would be explained away as ‘Ukraine was planning to detonate it in Moscow and it went early’ to blowing the dam, or simply allowing Ukraine to take it and then trying to flatten it with every piece of artillery they have. Thankfully, Ukraine seem to have decent intelligence and arn’t just sailing in there.
Ukraine has the best intelligence. USA itself helping with intelligence is amazing but I bet other western countries like France, Germany, and the UK are helping too.
If this war has taught me anything, it's that Moscow is a piece of that will say anything and everything, if it means gaining an advantage against its enemies. No matter how false or ridiculous it may be.
It’s not even just unreliable, it’s always a lie. They’re not even good at misinformation - they always lie. Back to back we heard intelligence reports their special forces were digging in and placing traps, then Russia says ‘oh no, no, no, we’re leaving, honest!’.
I would think given Russia’s actions the only sensible course for ukraine would be to try and take the damn and then surround and cut off the city and push the line further back beyond Kherson before trying to take it? Tbh It seems street to street fighting through the city rigged for defence would be exactly what Russia would want them to do, and we’ve seen again and again the Russian boots in the ground fall into disorganised panic as soon as it looks like they might get surrounded.
of course…Ukraine has not been this successful because they were lucky…Russia may leave the troops where they are, start retreating some in a fake out move or even go on an offensive or any combination but that’s at their peril and thus far Russia has considered their troops to be quite expendable. Ukraine has been consistently better and I hope that don’t change.
