Edit: holy shit, so many people completely miss a point which I thought to be apparent: I'm not suggesting Greece take over Turkey, I'm pointing that out to show how ridiculous any Turkish claim to Greek Islands in the Aegean sea is. The paranthases are there for a reason.
Turkey is an established fact. But when they make claims to Greek islands based on Ottoman rule, Turks should keep in mind that they are the latecomers in the Balkans.
The funny thing is that the majority of turks are greek descendants - a proven fact Turks find really inconvenient. Meaning that it's literally a Greek land occupied by mostly greeks.
I was more focusing on Greece as a country, not the Hellenic people. Turkey is essentially a successor state to the Ottomans, but Greece literally didnâ€™t exist as a modern country until the Greek Revolution.
Greece and Turkey have had a long long standing hatred of one another, stemming all the way back to the Greeks declaring independence from the Ottomans. It has ebbed and flowed over the years with both nations moving toward negativity since the fall of the Soviet Union which removed their largest common adversary.
