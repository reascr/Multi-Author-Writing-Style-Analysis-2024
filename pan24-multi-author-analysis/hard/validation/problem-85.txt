Except they actually came out on top; having taken many boatloads of riches back to France, they didn't even mind that some of those boats wandered off and disappeared...
I've heard similar talk; the vast majority of Russian citizens have failed to condemn their own government's actions. It's their duty to be informed and exercise democracy. Their complacency and lack of vigilance has allowed this war to happen. The Russian people will be disdained for generations.
Russia will be hated by the rest of the world forever, the living circumstances will get worse than in North Korea.
I saw a lot of videos in the past 10 months from Russian teens crying over everything they can't have anymore. They grew up with western stuff, they are used to it. There a millions of them and they are missing all those things already. They will keep missing it. Just imagine your average teen being without Jeans and a phone and make up and nails. There is no way to smuggle so much stuff into the country and not in the quality they are used to. It won't take long until they need parts for their cars for dishwashers, laundry machines and dryers. They will need clothes for the kids that are growing, shoes, parts for machines. Russia isn't producing, they are only supplying materials. A couple of years ago they didn't even know how to make cheese!
They grew up with that stuff, they are used to it. They want their luxurious life they had before the war back.
