We are not closing farms to 'comply with EU rules'. This is just framing. We are cloaing farms because the biodiversity in our nature reserves is getting destroyed by NOx.
This is fundamentally about forcing farmers to not pollute/destroy land not belonging to them while they grow stuff.
They've spent decades destroying our nature reserves for profit and the export market, using our own farming-subsidy money. and they still get to retire and millionaires. fuck em.
And if anything with the Netherlands importing less animal feed, more cropland can be used for human food instead of animal feed crops.
so again, if anything, this will LOWER the risk of starvation as we can produce more food for humans instead of food for animals.
And what this will do is cause less human edible food to be turned into animal feed which is then turned, very inefficiency, into meat calories.
And before you start worrying about food security, if anything, less meat produced in these high intensity farms means more food for people.
There are so many problems with our mass meat producing farms, this reduction really was a long time coming and highly overdue.
eventually others will take over the production of meat restoring the current situation. At no point does this lead to increased prices for staple crops.
