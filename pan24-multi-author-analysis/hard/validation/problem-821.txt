The French (weirdly, given their ability to produce arms) routinely spend way below their obligation as a NATO member, each member state is supposed to spend 2% GDP on Defence. France rely on American forces in region, as most European countries do tbh but they can, because America spends so much.
We are a European nation that's constantly trying to be dependent on the US instead of working with our close neighbours. Sticking with the Eurofighter would mean we would have a lot more planes for the money spent than trying to swap to the F35, France also has a great defence industry that we could have collaborated on an IFV together and likely got a better product faster than we did doing it in house. It also means if war breaks out, parts and technicians aren't across an entire ocean, but just the channel. Also collaborating closer to home means that both countries can benefit from the production as parts can be made in both creating jobs for everyone, rather than exporting more jobs to the US in the case of the F-35.
I didn't know that about the carriers, another waste of money then I guess. Also the Chally 2.1 is just another example of the MOD being far to incompetent to get anything done, these tanks should have been getting continuous upgrades since their release like the Abrams does, and don't get me started on the fact we have a rifled main gun still.
On the tank front they are just upgrading the challengers instead of making a new product, this is already long overdue and should have been getting done since the tanks deployment.
The British army are about to receive the 1st of their 4th gen tank the Challenger 3, which no one has any actual knowledge of it's capability yet, but is touted to be the most advanced battle tank on the market. So maybe he's talking shit? Lol.
