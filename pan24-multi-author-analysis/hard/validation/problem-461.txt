That's understating it. The budget for Russia's air force is larger than that for the _entirety_ of the Ukranian military, as in all branches, combined. And they were supposed to have a 5:1 air advantage. There's a reason why people where completely flabbergasted at them being unable to achieve air superiority with that overmatch.
As mentioned before, the weapons really only came in weeks after the Feb invasion since everyone was expecting said air force and conventional mismatch to flatten everything and it'd be a guerilla resistance. Also the West has specifically _not_ been providing any jets, and mostly land stuff the air force should be able to blowup, since that's the point of an air force.
yes, neither side is capable of gaining air superiority, and so far air power has had pretty low impact to the war overall.
Your billions have gone into creating an army who can pretty much take on the whole world together if needs be, wether it be in the land, air or sea, capable in mobilizing in any parts of the world in matter of days.
it obviously wouldn't hurt for ukraine to get more jets though, since it at least then they would have the possibility to out sustain russian air force, who will have difficulties to get new jets, or spare parts for maintanence.
To be specific, what they are referring to about russian jets needing visual confirmation is that so far in this war, russia has not used things like laser guided munitions or other ground-designated guidance systems/methods, at least not nearly as much as anyone would have expected them to. They also are not equipping their aircraft with targeting/sensor pods that allow for electronic aiming.
