Ahh but the problem with this is in America we have the two parties. And the two parties decide the choices here in many cases. People in CA chose to re-elect Feinstein each time because she is the only option the party give them for that seat if they want a Democrat each election. There might be some token opposition in a primary but you know the party is going to throw their support behind the incumbent.
There needs to be more pressure on the parties to force aging politicians to step aside and let someone else run when it become obvious they are getting too old to keep up with the demands of the job.
I do think many politicians today are too old, especially when you compare heads of state like Justin Trudeau and Macron to Biden however it's the responsibility of the people to vote for people who represent them. And if people choose these geriatric people to represent them they have to live with that decision.
Though it is also unfortunate that we have political parties that push to essentially pick who even shows up on a ballot or gets elected but it is what it is.
