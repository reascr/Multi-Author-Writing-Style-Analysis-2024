They were always gonna vote. It’s their thing, and they do it faithfully. Like it’s a duty to god or some shit.
They’re some of the dumbest people; the elections are all rigged and unfair, so I’m going to go outside and utilize them!
This is the shit that pisses me off about dems beating us over the head about "the most important election ever!" after doing fucking nothing with their power.
“Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.".
Ikr? It kills me that after all this time, I still see people on here saying "he'll be in handcuffs soon!" I wonder if they have not been paying attention, or if they are just incredibly naive.
There's a very simple reason...HE'S ABOVE THE LAW. I wish the Dems would say would start saying it out loud, instead of just implying it all the time.
r/politics needs to stop rallying this "aRrEsT tRUmP nOw" shit and focus on voting for the Democrats.
No seriously. r/politics would rather have Trump indicted now than make sure that Democratic candidates hold/expand Congress (lots of doomers in this thread and in many threads dooming the Democratic Party yet again).
If they arrest Trump days before the midterms, there will be exponential turnout, outrage, and violence from the GOP/GQP, thus possibly meaning Democrats lose Congress and people getting hurt/harmed/killed.
And all of these redditors claim that the DOJ and January 6 Committee is useless/spineless for not indicting Trump nOw. Like what?
