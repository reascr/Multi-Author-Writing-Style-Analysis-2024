I appreciate your respect of the people, and your love of your background. Just from a Jewish perspective being Jewish is binary, you are or you aren't.
Judaism isn't measured by blood quanta. That's a strange thing foisted on us by Nazi and white supremacy ideology.
Except he wasn't a "literal Nazi." Not defending her or saying she's not lying or whatever else. But it's important to make a distinction between people who actually were members of the Nazi party and the vast majority of German citizens who, while not blameless, also were not actually members of the Nazi party.
They are saying it is an interesting shift from being a literal Nazi a member of the armed forces of Nazi Germany, to raising your son to be Jewish, especially since other family members say that her father was not Jewish.
The point still stands is if her grandfather was in the wehrmacht, it is near impossible he was Jewish, and highly unlikely he raised his son as Jewish.
Definitely not controversial to have a grandfather who served in the military during the Nazi regime, unless of course you pretend to be Jewish while running for public office.
