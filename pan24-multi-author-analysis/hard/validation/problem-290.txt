"AN immense inordinate ambition, the kind of ambition which can take root only in the soul of an oppressed people and be nourished only on the misery of an entire country, is now astir in the hearts of the Russians. This essentially aggressive nation lives in a state of submissiveness so degrading that it seems to be expiating in advance, at home, its expectation of tyranny abroad over other men. The glory and the booty to which it looks forward turn its thoughts away from the shame to which it is being subjected; and in the hope of washing himself clean of his impious sacrifice of public and personal liberty, this kneeling slave fills his dreams with visions of world domination.".
Yes. Think of it as trying to show the breadth of opinions viewers might encounter amongst their family / neighbors / whoever. And with that in mind, note how the dominant core belief never changes - the regime is right, there are more extreme opinions going both ways but we stay the course with the regime, because it is great, we are great, russia is great.
No change, parliamentarians have freedom of speech, there will be fans of Putin in the EP even after this, in fact I suspect they will be quite vocal after the votes and criticising the outcome.
The vote in the European Parliament to recognise Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism happens in 10 hours.
Calls for the EU and its Member States to develop an EU legal framework for the designation of states as sponsors of terrorism and states which use means of terrorism, which would trigger a number of significant restrictive measure against those countries and would have profound restrictive implications for EU relations with those countries; calls on the Council to subsequently consider adding the Russian Federation to such an EU list of state sponsors of terrorism; calls on the EUâ€™s partners to adopt similar measures;.
