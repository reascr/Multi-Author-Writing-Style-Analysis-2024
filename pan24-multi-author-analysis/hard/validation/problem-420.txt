Ukraine will be well equipped with Western winter gear, have a cadre of new armor revamped and ready to fight, more stockpiles of Western and Russian munitions, and a motivated, well trained, and experienced force eager to roll up the fascists intruding on their turf.
All you need is to let the frostbite set in on the Russians and for the mud to freeze. Then it's showtime.
They will attack and shatter the land bridge at a time and place of their choosing and Russia will be damn near powerless to stop it.
If it's the Ukranians launching an attack to take the city and they actually succeed at getting a foothold...
Ok so more than once, the Russians have said they’ve capture Ukrainian marines there/landing there. Small groups, like 4 or 6. But I couldn’t ever find Ukrainian confirmation, and folks said too improbable to be believed. Also, the Russians never showed photos of these supposed POWs, and it’s not really Ukrainian MO to keep trying a failing strategy. . .
A. The Kherson offensive took a LOT of troops. They need recuperation of course, but sooner or later they'll be free again. And with all the bridges across the Dnipro destroyed, a lot of them will be free to be deployed elsewhere.
