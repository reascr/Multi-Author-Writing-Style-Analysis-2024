Wait so ... If my company office is at O'Hare plaza... They are legally required to give me sick time? Currently I only get pto and I need to use that for sick days.....
Getting paid sick days in addition to paid time off was such a trip for me. Never having them before was a weird hesitancy to use them because I'm in America and you work through it! This year I only get 20 days vacation and basically unlimited sick as well, crazy concept in the US to have over a month of the year off and sick time.
It's a good start at least. I think this is one of those situations that people need to sort of ease into it. We're a week becomes clearly commonplace so adding a week on top of it isn't such a drastic change that people get mad at for some reason.
The real joke is how much some people make how much, or how hard they work as part of their identity. I've seen and heard the "40hrs a week? I remember my first part time job!" Like it's a badge of honor. I get paid pretty well in a union job, I work my 40 and go home to enjoy time with my family and hobbies.
