Why does it have to be someone’s fault immediately after people get shot(other than the shooter of course). Seems like politics has gotten to the point where blaming the other side supersedes compassion for the actual victims and their families. Everyone is using tragedy as a selling point to push their agenda. The victims lives appear to be meaningless outside of helping everyone show why their side is right. It’s a shame that this is what we’ve come to.
I believe that both are possible for sure, my only point was that it seems like nowadays there’s very little acknowledgement of the victims or their families(especially in the media/social media) when things like this happen. I am sorry for your loss.
Sincerely sorry to hear of your past trauma. That definitely sucks and would influence your personal opinion.
- If you live with a spouse or intimate partner who owns a gun, you are 7 times more likely to be shot by that person.
- If you own a gun, the people who live with you are twice as likely to be killed by gunfire, and three times as likely to be killed by gunfire in your home.
- Your risk of being killed by a stranger is the same whether you live in a home with a gun or in a home without one.
However, that is no reason to perpetuate ignorance of documented facts or to put others at greater risk.
