Well, the government is responsible for inflation, unchecked gas prices, record corporate profits and price gouging, military war chest, gun culture and so on.
They know what causes the problem, corporate deregulation and government inaction for profits sake. But the GOP supports these things so the fault has to be pointed at people instead of NOT ENOUGH government being the issue.
One thing that irks me on issues like this is right wingers pretending to be populists criticizing government failures and thus clouding the message. People like Tucker (and Rubio in this case!) play at sounding pro-worker and pro-environment because they can use it to criticize democrats when they are in power, all the while carrying water for the corporations and policies that are actually the direct causes of the problem.
The actual socialists and socialist adjacent people are. But, that may be because they don't mind being ridiculed as socialists, and most of them don't have any tremendous political power to flex.
I didn't say democrats were good on this issue. They are better than Republicans, but that's not to say they are good. My point was that this criticism should come from the left and boosting Republicans making these criticisms isn't productive because they aren't serious about them, and their "solutions" would only make the problems worse.
Rubio clutches fake pearls about an issue his party has far more culpability for. The way people are talking about Buttigieg you'd think he personally under-regulated the industry for decades, nixed proposed updates to the safety infrastructure on behalf of the rail companies and their profits, and sided against rail workers to force them to stop strik-.. okay that last one might actually be worth criticizing the Biden Administration for, but coming from Rubio that's like Jeffrey Dahmer criticizing you for eating red meat.
