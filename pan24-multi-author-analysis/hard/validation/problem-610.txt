I think there’s people in leadership positions, within world governments that also have this mentality. Which leads me to believe many of these warmonger keyboard warriors are probably paid shills or bots, echoing thoughts of these pundits.
I would be unsurprised if this actually was a Russian missile. Their low-tech equipment would allow this margin of error.. Although, there could be debris with a Russian flag and video footage seconds before blowing up, and I’d hope world leaders would still deny Russian origin. I’m not saying it is absolutely a Russian missile, just that, what has been stated is literally the only sane and reasonable answer.
It makes sense that Ukraine is using these missiles, considering Russia is technically Ukraines largesr international supplier of weapons, by capturing them.
It blew up on the ground, so it wasn't fragments. I believe it was fired, and either another missile took the russian one out, or equally as likely, it just missed. Another user on this comment thread said Ukranian made missiles self destruct if they miss, Russian made ones only blow up on impact, target or not.
The older patriot missiles are an example, they weren't meant to impact the target intact, rather they detonate into a cloud of fragments disabling aircraft.
This is why investigations matter, many air defense systems were designed primarily for anti aircraft so will detonate near incoming threats.
So it is possible these rockets were damaged and sent off course. Two together seems a bit odd, I would suspect electronic countermeasures, but my knowledge of Russian systems and Ukraine's systems besides the lent stingers is far too limited.
It could also be a fuck up, with so many new systems being rushed into service without direct support Ukraine is bound to make mistakes.
