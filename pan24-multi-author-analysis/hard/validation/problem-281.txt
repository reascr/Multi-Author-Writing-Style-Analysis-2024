That's all it is, the places that actually look after their staff have no problems. It makes for great headlines though, "no one wants to work anymore" is just eaten up by the older demographics that still consume legacy media.
The incomplete headline should read: Pubs struggle to retain staff for same/lower wages after Brexit and Covid 'double whammy'.
It's kind of weird that this headline completely ignores the main reason they're struggling to retain staff -- low wages. All Brexit did was get rid of migrant workers from Eastern Europe who would be fine rooming with 5 other people in a 1 bedroom flat. The only impact from COVID is that people are far more reluctant to work a job that requires frequent physical contact with strangers, particularly for fuck all pay.
If they offered a decent wage, they wouldn't have these issues, but then they might need to jack up the cost of a pint, so it's far easier to just overwork the few desperate employees that remain.
Ironically those described as essential workers during lockdown are the least paid where as the people who are paid decently can work from home, shouldn't it be the other way round??
