If only right wing media and politicians had any shame. They just deny most things, even when someone like you brings the receipts. I've been telling my family for years Donald Trump is a con artist and only out for himself, but they won't have it. The immediate reaction is <latest Fox News talking point> or classics like Hunter or HRC. There is zero introspection, ever. Just eternal foolish pride or deflection: "I'm not that interested in politics," instead of ever admitting fault. Cultural division for profit has been going on for ages, but today's conservative media has perfected the art.
The Democratic party will usually at least admit what is and isn't fact. Whether they address a problem and if they do it anything about it is completely different. The US and most countries it seems now have shifted so far to the right that "fairness" or equal opportunity is somewhere way down the list behind the very first thing, which is increasing profits for a select few. It's so frustrating.
The manufactured outrage is a ruse of course to keep their voters clueless about the damage they're doing by crushing labor, keeping taxes for the rich lower than people making poverty wages, and cutting deals behind closed doors.
It takes air away from other real problems that might turn off white voters (skyrocketing insurance, lack of teachers, petty policy that costs voters money, cronyism, and totalitarian tendencies).
We have a ton of guys who are not scraping buy - big houses, big cars, big boats etc who buy into this bullshit.
