There have been protests against the invasion when it started but were shut down and there were protests against the mobilization but they got shut down too so the only resort for Russians is to flee the country their home which is really difficult as some neighboring countries won’t allow them to and civilians are saying they aren’t welcome I feel so horrible for people of both Ukraine and Russia who pay the price of what one person is doing.
Also there’s a new wave a protests in Russia from angry and distraught families who are upset that they were forced into war for nothing so yes protests are happening.
You would think with all the troops dying and coming home injured, and these women seeing what is happening first hand, it would start to change what Russians think about this war. I would think at some point they would come to the realization that Russia is at fault. From being in the US, I do realize that cultish behavior and gaslighting people can be hard to overcome.
Someone over there is going to have to take out Putin, or it won't end. It's going to have to be military. It will be labeled a massive heart attack. Closed casket.
