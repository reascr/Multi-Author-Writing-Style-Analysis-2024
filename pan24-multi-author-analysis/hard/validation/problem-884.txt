While Reagan (R) eliminated the fairness doctrine, it was it was Clinton (D), ironically, who signed the telecommunications act of 1996 which allowed the media to become such an effective weapon of the autocrats. The "free press" is supposed to be the thing that the framers believed would hold the government accountable. These days much of the country believes media companies are click-bait advertising platforms with fake news for views. Everything about the media industry needs a reformat.
So here we are, it is possible to use all three branches of the federal government to target and eliminate political opponents. The supporters of these autocrats are as bad. We see candidates or public officials openly encourage physical violence. Then supporters of these people physically assault opponents/their family, shoot at opponent homes, run political opponents off road, and/or turn out for insurrection and hangings. The media have been neutralized and rather than shine light on this corruption they salivate over every opportunity to print those juicy, click bait, headlines.
Is “being compelled toward stories of scandal and controversy” a bad thing for a media organization?
”Predictably, the mainstream news media is helping to amplify this fake scandal. It is almost inexorably compelled toward stories of scandal and controversy, especially around presidents and other leading political figures.”.
