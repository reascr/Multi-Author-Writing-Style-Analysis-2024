Thirdly; this entire idea was created from taking a quote from a Virginia governor candidate wildly out of context.
What he actually said was "If a child is born with a terminal and incurable illness, and it will quickly die, then the doctor should respect the parents' wishes about whether or not to put the kid through life-saving procedures which cannot save its life and will only prolong its suffering. The government shouldn't force itself into that terrible situation.".
They characterized it as "he said that kids that survive an abortion should be thrown in the trash.".
Yep. This was also a ballot proposal in Montana that failed back in November. It basically says that if a baby survives an abortion procedure, then the doctors will be forced to deliver it and treat it like any other case of premature birth, or else they will be jailed for five years.
More importantly, what kind of precedent does it set when you allow the murder of a child who is now outside the mother’s body and is capable of surviving on its own and can lead a healthy life but it needs immediate medical attention for it to survive? Do we just let a guy having a heart attack die because no one wants him to be alive? After all, no one wants him and he can no longer “live on his own.” He’ll die without treatment but he could live and continue to live for a time afterwards if he receives proper medical treatment.
I mean, a quick google search can tell you while extremely rare, it is possible for a baby to survive an abortion. It is far easier to destroy than it is to create.
