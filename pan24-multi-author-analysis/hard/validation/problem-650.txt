To clarify... website hosting is for places like Godaddy or squarespace, where you rent space on servers to create & host the website. Theses places may reside outside of the US jurisdiction and comply with other nations' laws.
Yes, there needs to be accountability for content like illegal content (CP) or offensive content (hate speech) which is why we reports and moderation. There is a form of this accountability already in place. not perfect, but it's there.
It's not always perfect, of course not. But it's not being done to any measure of effective degree currently, so I propose we start where we are and get a bill going in the Senate with committee meetings and discussions to hash out exactly what kind of standards to de-platform far right extremist hate content and lies can we implement today on social media and web hosting companies.
Similarly, there are certain web hosting domains and social media platforms that purposely advertise themselves as a safe haven for "free speech" And when you pull back the curtain you discover that a alarming percentage of far-right extremist content is hosted on a few key social media and web hosting services.
