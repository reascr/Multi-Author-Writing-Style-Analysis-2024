This is great way of looking at it. I roll my eyes whenever I hear people talk about our insignificance in comparison to the vastness of the universe. Yes, we are physically small in comparison to stars and galaxies, but we are also literally the universe observing itself. That’s pretty damn significant, in my opinion, and it’s unique in comparison to the vast majority of “stuff” in existence. Without sentient creatures like us (and any others that might exist), the universe would not even know about itself.
For me personally, the eternal question is where did the universe come from? I understand the big bang but where did any of that come from? Why does anything exist at all?
To your point, does the universe need to exist at all? What’s the point of all this…stuff? I don’t think the concept of “need” really factors into any of this.
Just that saying that we are significant due to the amount of atoms in our body isn’t a good way of measuring significance since the scale of the universe (and what can even be considered a “big” number) is unknown.
The problem with saying that this or that makes it more likely that life exists elsewhere in the universe is that we don't know what the numbers are, only that they're big.
But conversely, if the fraction of planets that develop life is more tiny than the universe is big, you'd be a fool to believe life is out there. This number is unknown. The fact that the other number is big doesn't tell us how it compares to this unknown number. Very, very big might still not be big enough.
Exactly, all of the bases in RNA and DNA can be produced by lightning strikes in Earth's early atmosphere, and we've known that since 1952, so the proper reaction to discovering them on meteorites is "so what". It's not having handfuls of random amino acids that matters, it's having a naturally occurring process to bootstrap evolution. Graham Cairns-Smith, for instance, wrote a nice book in 1985 outlining how this could theoretically happen through the action of flowing water on clay silicate crystals, the point being not that this definitively happened but that something like that could have happened.
But they don't seem to be self-assembling. Or if they are, the "supportive environment" is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. We don't know how they assemble. Certainly if you put them in a jar and shake it, life doesn't start. Maybe it would if you did that for a billion years, but maybe it needs something fancier than shaking.
