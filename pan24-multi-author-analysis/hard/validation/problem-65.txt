But Ukraine isn't going to honor the land grab of it's own soil. It's idiotic to " NO this our land now. You can't have. It's Russia now and you can't attack us directly. yep yep yep. That's how it works".
Russia is Trying to use the fact Ukraine doesn't want to strike sovereign Russian soil (they do but it may escalated the conflict).
Here is what i get from your statement, "I really don't give shit about Ukrainians dying as long as Russia is losing".
Ye reality disagrees with you, check any of the hundreds posts about the war and a lot of people are happy that as long as Russia is losing they are happy for the war to continue.
I remember reading way back that this is why the war was going so poorly, nobody was willing to tell Putin that his military wasn't up the scratch, and that Ukraine was ready to rumble.
Ye nice strawman mate here is your statement "Must admit it brings be great joy seeing Russia getting humiliated during this war. Any day i hear of russia failing miserably brings joy to my day.".
You do understand that as the war continues and "It brings joy to your day" people are dying, BOTH Ukrainians and Russians.
