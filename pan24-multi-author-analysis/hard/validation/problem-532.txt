Nah, I clearly didn't. Or at least, I was under the impression that there was something different about the current generation of those missiles that the Russians have access to that the US does not, something that affects the predictability, like not needing to go outside the atmosphere or something.
The fact that the US loosened its stance on Ukraine air-striking targets within Russia seems to be a reasonable indication that retaliation from Russia, nuclear or otherwise, is no longer a big concern for the western allies.
I think Russia should worry more about the allegations it has made direct attacks on the undersea cables and pipelines in the waters of other territories as some of those could trigger a NATO response, and that is a response they would not survive.
Are we going to talk about Russian allies providing military, mechanical, and supply assistance being directly involved in the war? I hope the dude knows he has completely embarrassed himself in just about every way at this point.
