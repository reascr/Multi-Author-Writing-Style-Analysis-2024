The future isn’t Republican. The party will rename itself and adopt some democratic rhetoric to remain relevant.
90’s and early 2000 were good relation for US and Russia. Don’t say never. We had business arrangements and influence on their culture, but Putin and the Oligarchs fucked that up.
Bullshit. They funnel personal benefits through their businesses. They hold their wealth in assets they take advantage of yet don’t pay taxes on. They use the stock market to cheat on income. They build shell companies out of country. They build trusts that are impossible for the IRS to navigate. They underpay employees comparative to inflation. They create “charities” to hide their wealth. Etc.
P.S. While you're at it, Mike, keep going all-in on the anti-abortion bullshit. That's working out really well for your party. (/s if that wasn't obvious).
Cool, does this mean I don't have to pay self-employment tax anymore to fund my retirement? Tax that I've been paying for 24 YEARS.
If the US government isn't going to give me my PREPAID BENEFITS (yes I'm entitled to them because I fucking paid for them, stop using entitlements as a dirty word) then I might as well be able to start investing this money on my own... and I'd like it all back.
