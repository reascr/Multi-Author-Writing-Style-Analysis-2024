Obligatory I'm not a republican and I'm allowed to criticize democrats and not be called names for it.
It's so obvious that he got that position because he stepped down and endorsed Biden in the primary, and he's been a politics-first, prepare for '24 transportation secretary from the second he was nominated.
More like cashing in on political favor while he bides time to run in '24. Pete has been a disaster at transportation secretary.
How exactly has he been a useless transportation secretary? He at the very least says all the right things when I've heard him being interviewed which seems like its often because the media loves talking to him.
He’s been doing a fantastic job with messaging lately, so I’m hoping he does or says something similar to this. That’s really all the Democratic Party has to do at this point for the next two years to win the media messaging game. Simply say, “This is what we have tried to do and the GOP said no,” and then they can just go highlight all the bullshit they’re doing instead of what they claimed they were going to do during the mid-terms.
I’m not talking about how all the GOP wants to do is be as obstructionist as possible and try to pin all of the problems that stem from that on the Democratic Party.
