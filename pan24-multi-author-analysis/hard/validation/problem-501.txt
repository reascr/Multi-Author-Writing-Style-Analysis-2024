Then why the flying fuck is that guy not dethroned. Oh, make no mistake, we may live in a different time in history, yet if that fucker is never unseated, & he passes his power onto family, then he is a modern day monarchy.
I hope that’s true. How do you begin to imagine your country is well when you are willing to kill your own people? No regard for human life; not even their own kin.
I really don’t get this. His country is falling apart & all he can publicly mutter is a damning of people he likely never meets. Like, why? It’s more stupid & pathetic than it is as foreboding/threatening.
That’s an incredibly condescending way of framing what is happening. Those “teenage girls” are risking life and limb in hopes of moving their nation forward. Sorry we can’t all be a heroic bad ass like you. Sheesh.
Okay. Can someone explain to what has the USA done... recently ? Like isn't there a Civil unrest ; women wanting not be treated like 2nd class citizens. Is that America's fault?
Yup, it's what always happens with these leaders that blame the west. They need a scapegoat for all of their problems.
