1) Russia doesn't have that kind of influence in Serbia. Serbia is somewhere in the middle between EU and let's call them "eastern powers" ( Russia and China ). Now EU has been applying a little pressure onto Serbia to sanction Russia over Ukraine which Serbia is reluctant to do as it still depends on Russia for a couple things, namely the UNSC veto and gas, but Russia is in no position to make any demands as that would push Serbia further to the EU side, so they have been threading carefully there.
1. Kosovo passes the license plate law requiring holders of Serbian license plates to obtain temporary Kosovo plates when entering Kosovo.
A bit wrong here with step 1 in your chain of events, it wasn't Serbs entering Kosovo that needed temporary license plates issued by Kosovo, it was ethnic Serbians living in Kosovo using plates issued by Serbia. They were being asked to use Kosovo plates.
Kosovo story is quite complex. It cannot be compared to Ukraine. Kosovo was (is?) a part of Serbia. It was an autonomous region. Do they have "the right" to a separation? Eh, difficult to tell. The constitution of Yugoslavia was as awful as possible, granting everyone the right to "self-determination" (choosing freely your own destiny), but at the same time adding "with the consent of EVERYONE ELSE", which is bonkers. Like saying, the law gives you freedom to do literally anything - for as long as everyone in the town agrees. That's not how laws (and logic) work.
