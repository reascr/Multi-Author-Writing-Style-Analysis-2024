Among the other prominent accounts suspended were the Elm Fork John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist group that provides armed security for LGBTQ+ events in North Texas, and CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that has published and distributed anarchist and anti-authoritarian zines, books, posters, and podcasts since the mid-1990s.
>“What I believe happened is that I and other accounts have been mass reported for the last few weeks by a dedicated group of far-right extremists who want to erase archived evidence of their past misdeeds and to neutralize our ability to expose them in the future,” Loder said. “What I suspect happened is that Twitter’s automatic systems flagged my account for some reason and no human being is reviewing these.”.
I've seen people claiming that they haven't noticed any changes with Twitter, and it just signals to everyone that they've long ago gotten sucked into this rabbit hole.

Wow, the right is really determined to turn Twitter into another right-wing rag site that no sane, reasonable person would want to spend a nano-second on.
Except Twitter has been kicking leftists off Twitter since it's inception, conservatives simply did not care. But when the shoe went to the other foot (for actually violating the TOS), oh the uproar. So the irony is there, you just missed its start.
