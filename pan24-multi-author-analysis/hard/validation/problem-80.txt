More surpisingly: we're a third of a millenium past that point, aaaaaaaand still doing the exact same shit (but now, with radiation!). Yay.
Holy fuck, that was in 1687! Didn't realize the armies even needed huge ammo dumps like that back then, though it's my bad for not knowing how fast artillery developed in the 17th century and how much its use was expanded.
I'd think that ships wouldn't need large ammo dumps on land, so I wonder what they needed a large dump for, whether it was one huge dump (or one of many), and how they planned on using it.
The cannons themselves weren't exactly mobile until probably Napoleon whose armies made great use of cannons on large wheels.
The first recorded use of cannons in warfare anywhere was at by the English, just 20 years after the first known depictions of cannons in Italy.
The Ottoman empire had already been using cannons for hundreds of years by that point. They used an that fired 1200 pound cannonballs over a mile to breach the walls of Constantinople in 1453.
