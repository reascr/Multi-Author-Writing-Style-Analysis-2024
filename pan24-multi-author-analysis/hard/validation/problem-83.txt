The article uses a lot of insider lingo that doesn't clearly explain the situation to the masses. I'd love for someone who understands FIFA's regulations better to comment on this.
Ok, dumb American question here: Why does FIFA have so much power over Football? Couldn't a group of major nations that are fed up with them simply create another organization to manage their collective Football leagues? I get that it would splinter the football world but if say a few dozen major nations and several aligned smaller ones bailed on FIFA how long would it last? I know the NFL has an enormous amount of power as well but would never get a way with the shit FIFA does.
Yeah it sucks, as much as I love football FIFA is ridiculously corrupt and I do not want to support them in any way. I boycotted the World Cup and basically only know what happened through news articles, probably gonna keep doing that for the foreseeable future because they are just so goddam crooked.
I don't care about soccer/international football, so ME not watching or supporting would be just the same today as a year ago when I also didn't watch or support.
Back in 2016 it came out that the single biggest donation source to the trump campaign of the 2016 election was Vince himself, using his own personal, non company affiliated money. Only problem with that line of logic js, all his money COMES from money he pays himself with the WWE profits.
So the way I see it, if I watch WWE and give them profits, then I'm responsible for trumps next donation. And if you watch FIFA, YOU are responsible for the next great atrocity that they pull. The next corruption we find out about.
