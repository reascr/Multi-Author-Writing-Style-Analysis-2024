>Secondly, Belarusian society is overwhelmingly against the country’s participation in the war – more than 90 per cent reject the idea of joining on the side of Russia. Sending Belarusians to war could therefore provoke a serious wave of discontent within the country, even more so than Putin’s mobilisation has in Russia. The Belarusian democratic forces in exile would likely use this to overthrow the Lukashenka regime.
So, the way I see it Lukashenko will not risk sending belorussians to this was. He does however serve a purpose. The ambiguity around the situation forces the Ukrainians to keep significant forces in reserve, because they cannot risk being invaded from Belorussia, thus making it a bit easier on the Russians. I think Lukashenko will periodically do things like speak of possible actions, or move forces around and such, just to keep the facade. But, I don’t think he’ll risk it.
I don't think they could kill Lukashenko. It's too high of a risk for Putin since he couldn't guarantee the next person ruling the country would bend the knee. Furthermore he wouldn't be in able to quell an uprising due to his military being tied up in Ukraine. If Putin tried to take the country by force he would be met with a serious insurgency from Belarusians and again wouldn't have the military for it. The only way would be to incorporate Belarusian military into the Russian military, but there would likely be decent.
I'd add that Belarus are also helping to train Russian soldiers, and to equipment from their own stocks.
I'd also add that even if the war were popular in Belarus. Why would they attack? They will lose troops, lose equipment, lose money, potentially lose stuff on their side of the border. And for what? They won't get any territory. They won't receive anything. There is nothing to be gained.
I think pretty similar to what you are thinking. Lukashenko is hoping to take Belarus as close to fighting with Russia as he can, without actually going to war. That way he gets to be pro-Russia and get support from Russia, without the downsides of sending people into war.
