>...the insurrectionary right absolves itself of responsibility for their repeated failures of judgment. Already, the incoming House Republican majority seems committed to engaging in quixotic flights of fancy that provide Republican members platforms to grandstand upon, even if that only reminds persuadable voters that the GOP has no interest in governing. And the most quixotic of all lost causes is the one in which Trump is most invested: investigations into his enemies.
In that scenario, then whoever made the deal with Trump would be completely disincentivized to actually follow through on a pardon, nobody wants to be the next Gerald Ford in U.S. politics. I'd be ok with that, too.
They deserve it for not impeaching him when they had their two chances to do so. I hope he loses the GOP primary, forms the Trump Party, and splits the GOP vote for a decade or more.
If something untoward happens to Donald Trump, I would look very seriously at those with the most to gain by taking Trump out of the game, and it won't be the Democrats.
The irony here is, some of the politicians still suck at his teat (Graham, Cruz just to name a couple) back in 2016, they said if they nominate Trump, it will be the end of the Republican Party. Their words, not mine.
