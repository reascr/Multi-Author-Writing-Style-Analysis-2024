I think you mean "euphemisms" - when you basically substitute an expression with another that is relatively similar in meaning, but has a much softer or more positive connotation. e.g.: "This isn't a war, it's just a special military operation!".
The whole "false dichotomy" things makes no sense in the context of your post. Are you mad someone is boiling a complex issue into a simple binary option (a.k.a. a false dichotomy) or that you think the word "support" is far too kind and harmless to describe what the russians did (euphemism)?
Seems like it, and yet it would have been so much more concise to write '_Russians killed one protest leader abroad/in Germany_'.
Maybe she was murdered by Putin's people, maybe Putin's opponents are killing Putin's people. Wouldn't be surprised if Putin's gone by the end of the year.
By the time this is over, he might be. Recently one of Putin's close allies was murdered accidentally fell from a window on accident.
I suspect most know deep down that it's a lie, but they want to believe it, because they'd rather not admit they were wrong or that they're supporting bad people.
