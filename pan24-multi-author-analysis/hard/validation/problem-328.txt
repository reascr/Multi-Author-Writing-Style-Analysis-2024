State Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, filed House Bill 714 and House Joint Resolution 50 last week that would create a new “District of Austin” to replace Texas’ capital.
So they want to take away all elected officials of one of the biggest citys in Tx so they can control it with people who are elected by people who dont live there, essentially taking away and voting power the people of Austin have.
Almost every single Republican who gets elected to state office drafts a go-nowhere bill like this that proposes some dipshit tactic to stick it to The People’s Republic of Austin. It’s like an initiation stunt for the Texas GOP.
This reminds me of the right wing idiots in my state. They want to separate Chicago from the rest of the state. Yeah sure, have Chicago keep ALL its tax money. For people who say they are patriotic they sure do hate parts of our country.
They hate enclaves of educated, smart and worldly Americans. They want to turn the country into nothing but their base: fearful, xenophobic, uneducated, provincial people living in backwaters insulated from both the outside world, and the world of ideas.
Fascist fucks, so hypocritical and undeserving of any label related to traditional conservative ideology. No wonder true conservative intellectuals like George Will have abandoned the GOP.
