If China wasn't actively threatening and provoking all of its neighbors they wouldn't be so united against it. "China is for actual defense" is a joke.
FFS, I dismiss the 1950s and you bring up the Monroe Doctrine from 140 years earlier? Your defense of China seems to rely very heavily on ignoring the last 50 years worth of events.
You might want to read up into what China is doing in the South China Sea and the nine-dash line because you're missing quite a bit of information. And ignoring that the only reason that North Korea is flinging nuclear-capable missiles over South Korea and Japan is Chinese funding. Those are clearly provocative and threatening actions and even all that ignores the wolf-warrior diplomatic core.
We all realize that. Unfortunately Taiwan becoming a territory of either side is an existential threat to the other, so if either side goes in the other must.
Only "neighbor" China threatens is Taiwan which US and China agree is part of China since 1949 when US installed Chiang regime in Taiwan and planned to use it for invasion of China while claiming Taiwan was the official government of all China.
But China is defending against US which has waged war on China via proxy Taiwan since Chinese independence in 1949.
If china was ever successfully invade taiwan and seize its manufacturing, I wish them luck defending it from us attacks.
