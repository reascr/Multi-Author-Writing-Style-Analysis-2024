Trump isn’t the only one that needs to go. The Extreme Right currently has a stranglehold on the Republican Party. DeSantis which is supposedly his successor is just as unfit for office. When you transport immigrants from another state to Martha’s Vineyard as a pure political stunt or you retaliate against Disney just because they spoke out about your LGBT policies then you are unfit for office. These are just bit a few examples. If you think it’s just Trump, your poorly mistaken.
Trump has never been presidential. He's not off the rails now because he was never on them. He was mildly tempered by people in his administration who thought they could prop him up to be presidential, yet they all failed miserably.
The Trump moving forward is only going to be less trusting of the GOP, less trusting of those who understand politics, and more fly by the seat of his pants. Any control the GOP had over Trump is dwindling to the point of non-existence. Spite and anger are just going to be his wheelhouse from here forward.
