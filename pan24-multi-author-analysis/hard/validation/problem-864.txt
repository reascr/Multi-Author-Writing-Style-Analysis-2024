"The democratic president hasn't managed to deal with the massive deficit he inherited from us fast enough! So now elect us again, so we can blow it up so large, that the next democratic president will fail to fix it entirely as well.".
Yep. Right wingers in Poland keep complaining that these deals were influenced by the USSR, and that they didn't get enough money out of it.
It's also seems worth noting that this was brokered by the USSR, which saw both Poland and East German as Soviet vassal states at the time. But the frontier line was definitely made permanent by resettlement patterns and the breakup of the USSR...
It seems worth noting that, after the war, Poland received significant German territories, well over and above that taken by Germany in 1939.
I mean, in Germany’s defense, the modern Polish borders include huge areas of territory that were part of Germany until the end of World War II. Silesia, East Pomerania and Prussia were effectively destroyed on the basis that Prussian militarism had caused WWI and WWII.
It isn’t often discussed in textbooks, but iirc something like 2 million Germany civilians died when they were forcibly exiled by the Soviet army.
