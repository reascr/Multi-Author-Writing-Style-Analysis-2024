There is a law preventing this because that idea is silly. PLACA shields these manufacturers because they are not responsible for anything that happens with that product after purchase, the same as every car manufacturer is not responsible for someone buying a vehicle and plowing through a crowd. Knife manufacturers arenâ€™t responsible if you hurt yourself with a knife or someone else either.
I agree with you something meaningful should be done but I cannot think of an effective solution because clearly Californias hundreds of gun laws only hinder law abiding gun owners and do little to nothing against criminal use of a firearm.
Well it's not legal to leave California and go into other states to buy guns that aren't legal in California, so if you aren't going to obey that law then you might as well stay in California and not obey the law.
They have been out of power in California for a long time, the Dems in CA don't need anything from the Republicans when they can just hammer through any legislation they want. Pretty incredible to blame the other side when you have a supermajority that can't be resisted.
