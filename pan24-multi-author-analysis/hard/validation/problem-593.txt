Two.. Russia gave a stupid reason to invade its neighbor.. Russia doesn't own the people who speak russian.
And dont talk to me about the pathetic attempt at russian protests. In a country of 140M about 100k (and i am being generous with the number) ppl in total protested in March for a couple of days (then there were no protests). Of all those people about 4.3k were detained but not arrested. They faced fines and some kind of community service. The only people jailed for 3 to 5 years are a handful of bloggers/youtubers/artists that spread some form of antiwar content online. That is a fraction of a percent of the people wjo protested. A FRACTION OF A PERCENT. That is pathetic. Allow me to reiterate, they protested for a few days with basically no form or persecution weighing on them and then stopped.
No it doesn't take courage to protest 2x and then forget about it. And yes I have protested in my country.
But have you protested? Thats my question. Would you protest knowing you be in jail for 5 years? And please donâ€™t take credits away from those who protested in Russia. It takes good courage to do it.
