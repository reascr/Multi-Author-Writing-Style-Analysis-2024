The worst she can do now is split the senate 50/50. That would mean committees would have to be split and a lot of things a majority could do wouldn’t be possible. She’s still finding a way to hold the senate hostage.
2) To maintain her power in the Senate right now. With a 51 seat majority her power is MUCH less diluted unless she has a partner (like Manchin) to get what she wants. As an I she can leverage the Dem's complete control over the chamber (i.e. not needing the existing power sharing agreements) by saying "give me what I want or I caucus with the Rs taking us back to 50-50".
A very small subset of registered Dems or registered Reps will voter for her as an Independent but some of the left leaning Independents might throw a vote her way.
1: The Senate makeup is now 50-49-1. there are independents, just that they usually vote in favor of the democrats.
3: Votes in the senate will now most likely be 51-49 or just 50-50, in which vice president can be the tie breaker. It doesn't change much.
I mean, in and of itself this doesn't change anything. She can vote however she wants to vote once she's elected. She was already unreliable for Dems and people were accusing her of being a secret conservative and whatnot. Plenty of her voters already felt betrayed.
