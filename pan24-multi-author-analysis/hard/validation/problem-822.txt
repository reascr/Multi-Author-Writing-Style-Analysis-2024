Lets be honest, shootings will only be allowed whin in danger OR there are no cameras present. If someone is shot, deny it. Then say Palestinians did it. Then say militarily needed, no matter the circumstance. And anyway, even if found guilty, worst is some community service and a smack on the wrist with a soft rag.
Even America, which is a huge apologist for Israel is pissed at the land grab of the illegal settlements. No there is not a war. As far as I know Palestine has no military. If people being shoved around fight back, that is not a war. And, exactly why in a section of Palestine, why are there more Israelis than Palestinians?
even the concept of a palestinian country/nation only took form after Zionism started. This says to me, the idea of a palestinian state is not something that was desired by the palestinians, as much as them wanting what the other "kid" was getting. If the palestinian desire for nationhood was so strong, why did it never make an attempt to come into being?
Your country is a moral thing to fight for, but as I mentioned, Palestine was not a country. Nor to be honest (and being honest I will admit i have not looked into this exhaustively), do I know what is unique about Palestinian culture or nation, as opposed to Syria, lebanon, jordan, or egypt.
I suppose I am questioning the strenh of purpose, of being of a palestinian state if it only exists in opposition to something, as opposed to being founded/desired on it's own inherent principles and values. Do they say "we need an identity opposed to the Israeli one, so if Israel has a country we want/deserve one", and so they only define themselves in opposition to Israel, no Israel, no palestinian identity.
And this is where things get dicey, because by this point the locals in the once-more-stateless land were still openly hostile to Israel (who, reminder, occupied it in a defensive war), but they wanted to become their own independent state. Israeli politicians at the time supported this notion, but on the condition that it would come as a result of negotiations with an elected body representing the Palestinians (unlike the "representatives" who were appointed for them by the Arab League when the UN was forming the partition plan).
There are still plenty of left wing Israelis who hope for a peaceful two state solution, but history since the Oslo Accords has made it more and more difficult for them to gain any traction in government.
A great proof for this, is that every time we had a liberal government, a peace treaty in process, any real progress towards ending the conflict, there would be a wave of terror attacks at the heart of israel's cities, which would snuff out any hope for co existence in israeli civilians which vote for more right wing politicians that promise to restore safety. Israel's left wing is almost non existent since the events of the second Intefada.
