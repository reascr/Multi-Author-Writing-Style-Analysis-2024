This is great. Unfortunate that they didn't consult a teacher to make the board realistic though. Kind of plays into the stereotype of them being easily replaceable and not Professionals.
Didn't realize constructive criticism was so controversial. The other argument is that 'It's a cartoon'.
Cartoon meant as a political message, the political message is tied to hate on teachers currently and the right lying about what they're teaching and their professionalism.
The audience for political cartoons is largely people who attended school when blackboards were still common, and so it's relatable to those readers even if it's a little anachronistic. It fits those people's mental image of what a normal classroom looks like. I'm not that old and we used blackboards. There are probably schools that still have blackboards.
Blackboards are less common but still used. Also, a speech bubble overlapping onto a whiteboard would be two sets of black text on white background, but the reader is only supposed to pay attention to one of them. Just visually confusing and ugly.
