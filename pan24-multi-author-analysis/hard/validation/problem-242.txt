Kemp sounds like he has a mouth full of syrup when he talks. Walker sounds brain damaged, which he is.
Walker is the same thing here. Just utter incompetence sent out there with a 3 by 5 card with some catch phrases on it and a "go get em tiger" pep talk from his handlers. There's nothing wrong with not being capable of important jobs. Some things are just better off left to people with above average intelligence and this includes someone tasked with representing an entire state.
I did grow to almost like her despite running with actual traitors but it was more out of pity than anything else. She was led to believe she could do a job that was way out of her league and it all came crashing down.
So, this year, the Republicans ran this dipshit for secretary of state in California named Rachel Hamm. I swear, they ran her as a test case to see how effective their propaganda was with a baseline of utter incompetence for the job at hand in a state they knew they wouldn't win. I watched her quite a bit and she was in with the main crowd like Flynn and Bannon so there was a real effort to push her into the spotlight, but she is just absolutely clueless. She wasn't even that proficient in rattling off the fox news lines like most of them can do in their sleep.
