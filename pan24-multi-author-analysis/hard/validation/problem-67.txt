And for added context: Russia was in process of a missile strike campaign targeting most if not all major Ukrainian cities. So, he probably had good reason to believe so.
Yes it does. That's the simple truth. It sucks and I hate it but I'm saying even without that she's kind of a long shot. We need something more of a sure thing if Biden doesn't run.
Won't Biden be 82 by 2024? Even if he's mentally fit by then, does anyone really want to take the chance he'd last four more years being just as sharp between 2024 to 2028? Or to even live that long? "Four years" of health is a big difference between someone in their 40s and someone in their 80s.
IIRC, it was specifically Donald Trump who wanted to make the transition as difficult as possible because he's unbelievably petty. If it had been anyone else, it would have worked. But Biden and his team already had eight years of experience working as 2 that it was no issue.
The problem is if Biden doesn't run then Usually the VP ends up being the pick. And I don't mean to inject any negatives here but there is just no way Harris would win a national election like that. I mean even ignoring the racism and sexism in this country she just isn't that well liked by middle of the road swing voters. If Trump really is running again then we absolutely need a candidate that can win.
