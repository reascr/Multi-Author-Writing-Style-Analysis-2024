Trump just said the quiet parts of traditional Republican doctrine, out loud. He connected with those too stupid to understand dog whistles. If he goes it alone, they get to publicly sanitize their reputation without changing anything.
But you want him to take "his" idiots, like MTG, with him. Unfortunately it's bigger than Trump - you need to remove Trumpism too. We've seen just how many craven politicians are following that playbook around the world.
Weak, depraved, greedy people who have no prospects of comparable success in any field other than politics. These are Trump's enablers. That is why I think he will be back in 2024.
On the other hand, one party rule for a decade would do a lot to get the country, especially the Supreme Court, back on track. Maybe that period would end with the formation of a Progressive Party. Think about that, if the choice in every Senate and Presidential election was between a Democrat and a Progressive, and the Republican rump was confined to a handful of House seats.
But outing republicans and taking them down might align the views of the people who once voted for him including those closer to the center who voted for him just because he wasn't a "typical politician.".
Been sayin this for a while. He has the dumb dumb 30%, he has the victim card, and he has the potential martyr card. This needs to be surgical, and it needs adults to do the surgery.
