>If Jesus got a bad rap while Trump was president, it is no oneâ€™s fault but that of the right-wing Christians who could have rejected him but instead venerated him.
The irony of it all is that this week's gospel is from the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus says to make amends with each other, and to pray for our enemies. It's truly sad that a religion has been coopted by radical evangelicals in the name of hate. I'm sad that this company is backed by the wrong people, but this is the message of Jesus that needs to be taught. If liberal Christians aren't going to use it, someone else will. Christianity will forever be associated with hate until those with love use it for love.
So I agree with the sentiment and I will continue to do my part to try and educate others what the true meaning of this religion is, but it's an uphill battle. I mean, our president is a Catholic and hasn't spoken much on these issues. He can 180 them like he did at the SOTU and point out their hypocrisy. For fuck's sake the word literally comes from the bible.
