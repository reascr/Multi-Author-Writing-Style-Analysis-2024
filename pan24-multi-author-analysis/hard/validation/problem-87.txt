I get it, I do, but it is kind of annoying seeing everything King Charles does and has done be ridiculed despite him pushing for more positive environmental change and acting on more change than any government weâ€™ve ever had.
I think King Charles is doing an okay job for an essentially powerless titular head - and he has long been pro-environment and done a lot to advance environmental causes from what I understand, but its not enough to outweigh the hatred people have over the death of Diana - which he had nothing to do with after all. I don't get it either.
Now, resenting being rich and representing an outdated institution, I get that, but even that is shaded by Diana. If one of his sons becomes King, I bet the Media reverses direction 180 degrees and makes Royalty cool again because a young monarch will sell more advertising with the public.
The Media built very heavily on the narrative of Diana the young princess - and as it turns out she was a fantastic woman. Then she and Charles had trouble due to it being an arranged marriage - and the Media built up her side of that story and made bank on the results. When she died due to being pursued by those same Media people - they turned up the blame on Charles. Public opinion has never been on Charles' side and now that he is King, the media continues to ride the unpopularity they generated and the public is swept along with it.
