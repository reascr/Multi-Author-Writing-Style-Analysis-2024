Do you think the price of goods would come down with strangled supply lines, or would it be even more expensive?
The price of goods are high, so what does the the government do to curb inflation? They raise the interest rates How does that effect the working class? Your average worker can now not afford to lend money. Does this do anything to bring down prices? Sure, but business owners sett the price in the first place The rich have had record profits in almost every sector since COVID, and the poor have effectively become poorer due to inflation and limited access to credit!
Biden conceded. Made it illegal for the workers to add to the discourse no striking no really consequences because "ooh no my economy". I could go thru supply shortages for a few months if it means the working class can collectively bargain. I'm already a fucking poor man as it is. Not many businesses would survive tho and that's all that matters to a politician in this country. Their donors are king.
Keeping the country running is more important than workers rights. That's the whole issue. This is just COVID lockdowns all over again.
