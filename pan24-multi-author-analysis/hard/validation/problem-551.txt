And the 2nd part, 'Chinese' can mean many things. In fact, I just used "Chinese threat' but I did not mean Chinese people but instead China's government. But 'Chinese' can also mean people from China and adhering to China's values or it can mean people of Chinese race which can be Chinese-Canadians or Chinese-Americans or Taiwanese or Chinese Malaysians etc.
I 100% agree in the two major points you made. In trying to avoid being seen as racist, Canada and many others turn a blind eye to the Chinese threat.
The compulsion that leads Canadians to say, "oh but I'm not racist though," is also leading Canadians to turn a blind eye to Chinese threats.
And not everything is about race, or ranking people's humanity by their physical form or ethnic roots. Sometimes "Chinese" means "originating from the Chinese state and adhering to its values.".
It's probably downvoted because there's no explanation about what Trudeau had to do with it. He's not great but please be specific if you want to educate people about this.
