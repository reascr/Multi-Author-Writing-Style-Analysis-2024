In the 90s they were really planting all their seeds for a lot of this shit. Gotta sneak Jesus in everywhere you possibly can. Science class? "Teach both sides!" History/Civics? "What about all the Christian member of/parts to the Founding Fathers/the US?".
That's the thing. I don't expect The Church writ large to condemn this nonsense because the majority subscribe to it. (And so I understand the cynicism of most commentators here) But there are small congregations and individuals who can and must speak out against it immediately. And I hope that the cynics will give them a bit of credit if/when they do because that minority of sane, Christ-following Christians are much-needed allies against this brand of fascism wrapping itself in the trappings of Christianity.
Any Christian that considers themselves Christian nationalist, or any other flavor of theocrat, should picture that happening to books of the Bible that don't fit the needs of the state at any given time, and remember that's what Christian nationalism looks like in the long run.
I'm Gnostic, so other Christians disown me, and my whole religion is centered around opposition to religious dogma, all the way up to and including our views of the creator himself, so I don't know if I really count... but I denounce Christian nationalism and all forms of nationalism in the strongest terms.
I am a Christian and I denounce nationalism and any other form of hatred against other humans. I fight this fight with love every day and on Sunday at church. There are many in my church that support trump as if it is in line with their Christian belief, that you have to support him. It is extremely odd at best and more likely very dangerous at worst. I am making progress on some though, and helping them to see the error in their ways. It might just be my experience, but I find empathy and focus on forgiveness and restoration is the best way to get their heads out of their ass.
That all said, there are more than just a few that feel the same way I do at my church. I felt I was the only one at first and it made me feel like an enemy at my own church and treat them that way until I took the time to really dig deep and be vulnerable about the issues with trump/maga stuff. Itâ€™s hard to see past the crazy beliefs of maga and see the human behind those beliefs, but it is necessary to restore them.
