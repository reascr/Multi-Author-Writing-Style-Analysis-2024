Took them over 2 decades to copy a dc-9 and they still haven’t certified it in any other countries. That’s 1960’s technology. Douglas tried to help them in the 80’s, Sukhoi of Russia had to design and build the wings for them to put on it because they couldn’t build the wings, and they still can’t make a native turbofan engine and buy them from GE or Rolls Royce. So decades for an advanced stealth aircraft is probably pretty accurate.
"The last 10% is harder than the first 90%" is an extremely relevant saying regarding stealth planes. It is comparatively easy to make a shape with a lower radar cross section, hide engines within the fuselage, use s-bends to obscure rotor blades, and reduce airplane noise. The hard part developing and maintaining radar absorbing paint cost effectively, transitioning from a design that uses low radar cross section techniques to one that doesn't compromise the cross section for other features, and carefully machining the components with extremely precise tolerances.
The continued operation of an "outdated" bomber like the B-52 is precisely because the B-2 has such advanced stealth characteristics. The B-2, as a bomber, compromises different functions by maximizing stealth. The B-52 still has uses today when the B-2 is not needed, when it's ludicrous operating costs cannot be justified for a mission.
Time will tell if the Chinese airforce and industry can stomach the true costs of a stealth plane program, and whether or not these planes turn into parade peices, or a millitary backbone.
There's good reason why arms suppliers outside the USA aren't making lots of their own true stealth planes, it's really expensive, and the DOD is able to absorb the costs. And even the mighty USA Military isn't able to fully realize their potential.
