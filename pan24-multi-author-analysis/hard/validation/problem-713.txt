"Just a month before his 20th birthday, Mr. Santos entered a small clothing store in the Brazilian city of Niterói outside Rio de Janeiro. He spent nearly $700 using a stolen checkbook and a false name, court records show.
Mr. Santos admitted the fraud to the shop owner in August 2009, writing on Orkut, a popular social media website in Brazil, “I know I screwed up, but I want to pay.” In 2010, he and his mother told the police that he had stolen the checkbook of a man his mother used to work for, and used it to make fraudulent purchases.".
yes. takes 2/3 of congress to expel him. After this, the Dems would retake the seat in a special election for sure, so the last thing McCarthy needs (assuming McCarthy gets a position where he cares, tomorrow), or anyone in the GOP, is to go from 222-213 down to 221-214. You go from 5 Republicans together needed to pull a "Manchin" to 4.
I've known a few people who are much like this guy, compulsive liars - will say anything without regard for truth or even simple consistency, just to make themselves seem important; they rely on most people either not caring, being too polite to call them out, or not being interested enough to remember earlier details. If they are called out, they find a way to say "Did I say X? What I really meant was Y, which is sort of X" - much like Santos' explanation that he meant he was Jew-"ish" (which apparently is still a lie).
I think the real interesting answer is what's coming financially. Supposedly he had a corporation, which apparently does not appear to have done any real business, that suddenly was able to pay him enough that he could (allegedly) lend his campaign $700,000 of money he received from his corporation. If this was simply a dodge to get around campaign limit finance laws, then he and whoever gave him the money are both guilty. Not to mention any interesting shenanigans the IRS might be interested in.
