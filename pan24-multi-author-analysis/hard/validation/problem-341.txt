I know a dude who was offered a position in the Communist Party in the '80s as he had made a name for himself within the Soviet defense industry.
I think it's more that you're hearing the clueless, entitled, rich classes bitch about their lost "freedoms". From friends there to musicians and artists I follow, there is no real bitching about this stuff, only disdain for Putin's regime for doing this. Of the "bitching" I've seen its purely in the sense of "fuck this awful war, we just wanna live our lives and let them live theirs.".
Idk. I suffer from depression and anxiety and I mean it when I say I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. And that includes Russians. Cut off every last product and service from the West.... but not medicine. Necessary medicine should be a human right.
Now, I can already see the replies that they should be - deserve to be - depressed and anxious. But the worst affected are the people not buying the propaganda, because they know shit is bad and atrocities are being committed by their country and it weighs on them. How can they be expected to start revolution if they can't even get out of bed? Many people can't afford to leave the country. They're trapped and know it and powerless and depressed.
