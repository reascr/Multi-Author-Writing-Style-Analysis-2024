If your entire sovereignty movement just blatantly ignores the basic structures of government as set out in the constitution, which is also the basis of your governments authority, you're gonna have a bad time.
The law’s not really about the sovereignty movement like the headline implies, it’s about trying to limit the power the federal government has when it acts (in their view) without proper authority. Right now how it works is the feds write laws that then have to be enforced in the provinces, if they think the law violates the provinces jurisdiction they have to go to court and prove it. This new law tries to put the onus on the feds to prove their law does not violate provincial jurisdiction before it is enforced.
When they actually make a law that violates the division of powers, it'll get challenged quick enough. Probably not by the federal government, but by a civil group that got screwed over by it.
Yes, our provincial government are a bunch of amoral idiots. They think that declaring “sovereignty” with no takesie-backsies is a nuanced political tactic. They think that we can separate from Canada, somehow keep the Crown Land and Treaty Lands, and that the UN Convention on Transit Trade of Land-Locked States will somehow force other provinces to let us build pipelines across their land. They’ve forbidden mask mandates in schools and have created a ministry specifically to protect anti-vaxxers from “discrimination” at a time when we have record numbers of children sick and in hospital. There are too many other things to go into here, but basically they’re the worst fucking government in the history of the province - and that’s a low bar to hit.
Please know that the majority of Albertans don’t want any of this. It’s embarrassing that this government has the support they do, according to polls, but it’s not out of line with the level of support Republicans have in the USA, for example. So, in that respect it’s not unusual. But still embarrassing.
It was supposed to “allow Alberta to ignore federal laws or regulations that the provincial government deemed harmful to the province”, but everyone with half a brain knew that was complete bullshit that would never fly. The Lieutenant Governor hinted that she would not give Royal Assent to any bill that was blatantly unconstitutional, and this was. As a result, clauses about “ignoring” federal legislation were diluted to the point where any possible interpretation is already covered by existing legislation.
