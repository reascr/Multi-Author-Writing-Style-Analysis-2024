Japan's "carriers" are only capable of flying helicopters and F-35s. Two are 20,000 ton and two are 27,000 ton ships.
For comparison, the UK's Queen Elizabeth class weigh in around 70,000 tons each. The US's Nimitz class weigh in around 100,000 tons each. Even the US's America class helicopter assault ships are around 45,000 tons.
So Japan does have ships that could be considered carriers, but they aren't in the same tier as the big guys.
Edit: Japan is realistically looking at squaring up against China. I'm sure China is really having a "good hard think" about the prospect of approximately 40 F-35Bs in the entire Japanese Navy coming up against 150 Chengdu J-20s, 400 Shenyang J-11s, and 500 Chengdu J-10s.
Unless Japan plans to fight America or Britain, small carriers loaded with F-35s should leave any prospective adversary having a good hard think.
No, they have "aircraft carriers" in the sense they have relatively tiny ships that are only really useful for domestic defense. Japan is constitutionally prohibited from having an effective aggressive military. They are far more capable of defending themselves now but their military is still not capable of waging an offensive war.
Yup, that's why the most powerful and advanced military in the world built the Gerald R. Ford, the largest warship ever made, and commissioned her in 2017. Because the most powerful and advanced military in the world doesn't know the value of an actual carrier. It's obviously going to be obsolete and they were big dumb dumbs for spending money on it.
Their army is only 150k personnel and their air force is less than 50k. You can't wage a war with just a navy.
