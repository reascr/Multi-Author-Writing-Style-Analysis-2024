This is especially true in English where we use compound words, hyphenated phases and space separated phrases interchangeably.
I remember learning in high school that some compound words are separated by a space instead of a hyphen.
No, it's a compound word separated by a space. AKA open compound word. Another example is "dining room".
They look like two words to us normies, but grammar enthusiasts insist they are one. I hate English.
I majored in this language and I earned the right to hate it. I look forward to whatever genderless replacement we get, even if it is “doubleplusgood” at this point.
The whole silent letters (looking at you: French) is ridiculous and also needs to go. “Drive-Thru”is accepted and no one makes the throaty noise for the end of “through” any more, so might as well save people the three letters. This would demolish written French as we know it, but I want neither of them to be the language of the future (and they are the two languages I know the most).
Many romantic languages has genders applied to nouns, which is aggravating since a chair and a table have no genitals and thus do not need gendered identifiers.
