It's bad for a plethora of reasons, most notably for making one's focus on their studies split with a tedious job, which makes it much harder to digest what they're learning. University studies involves what you'll do for the next 40-50 years. Some asshat's business you work at to afford rent just distracts you and burns you out, making success in school and at work both questionable.
I used to run over 10 miles at a time sometimes; now I never exercise because it takes over an hour to get a good workout, and I don't have over an hour after doing everything else for a given day. Having to time yourself when you read course materials and write essays, etc, just stresses you out and affects the quality of your work. College does not go well with a 30 hr+ job; anyone who disagrees either didn't have to work in school or did, but half-assed their schoolwork. Tuition is extortionately high, so it would seem most ideal to make the most of it by not cutting your study time, to not waste the money spent on it.
Most people with advanced jobs don't work in university. They study, attend classes, do internships, participate in societies and exercise 5x/wk. Spending 45% of your waking hours working and 45% doing school is unhealthy and is prone to failure. As an American student, I can absolutely attest to this. And when dorm neighbors (people in other dorms) keep you up till 3 AM? That's why it's so bad to have to work in college, because it both affects your life balance and makes you more vulnerable to delinquent kids who disrupt your ability to rest.
I think the number of hours here on average and if they are in school or not is crucial to determine if this really is a bad thing, right?
I had a job in highschool even part time after school/ weekends, which was not a bad thing and certainly didn’t intrude on my classwork. I think highschool kids getting part time jobs isn’t a bad thing and it helped develop my work ethic/time managenent skills. Same goes for college.
Edit: after reading again, no, it doesn’t mention a demographic of young people working while also studying.
Is this only referencing kids working in universities? I understand being forced to get a job when studying, that makes complete sense, but someone not pursueing higher eduction or a trade and being forced to get a job doesn’t seem like a bad thing.
