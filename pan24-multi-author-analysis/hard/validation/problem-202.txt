My conservative family members are already telling me how “Biden’s doc situation is way worse than Trump’s!” I think the false equivalency machine is working as intended so far on the right.
This feels disingenuous, CNN was saying trump stole nuclear secrets and committed treason, none of which were true, Republicans making fun of biden for doing the exact same thing seems pretty justified.
Actually since Trump has such a powerful mind he accidentally declassified the Biden documents when he was thinking about all the documents he needed to psychically declassify. . He had intended to only include the Mar-a-Lago documents but instead used the overly broad "all documents stored in unapproved locations tag".
Trump is the one who notified the press about the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence. If he hadn't gone public and cooperated (even at that point) the whole documents scandal might have gone unnoticed. There is a good chance that the Biden team did a pre-emptive sweep for any documents to head off GOP investigations. Unfortunately they did discover some classified documents. Assuming the possession was inadvertent, at a minimum it indicates better procedures need to be put in place for outgoing politicians and "their" property.
Legally the Biden documents should have no relevance to the Trump case. Politically the Trump supporters lack the cognitive ability to distinguish between the two cases.
