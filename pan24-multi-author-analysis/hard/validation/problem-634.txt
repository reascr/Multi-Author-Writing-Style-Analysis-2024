Wouldn't this essentially give the clearing agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI, etc) the power to veto any candidate? It sounds good in theory, but in practice I think it could open the door to significant abuse.
There is a potential for abuse. Unfortunately I think that’s always the case. Not having any background checks or security clearances strikes me as the greater evil, however.
Security clearance is notably more complex. A security clearance level for lawmakers would need to be established. And the process of awarding clearance would need to be insulated from political interference.
Background checks (and drug tests — why not) should be required before a candidate gets on the ballot.
Background checks are less concerning because they would (in this case) simply verifying that the background that a candidate claims is accurate. The background check requirement might act as a deterrent against falsifying background information. The background check would not necessarily need to be performed by a government agency.
Background checks are requirements for many jobs in government and private industry. Our lawmakers should be held to the same standard—at the very least.
