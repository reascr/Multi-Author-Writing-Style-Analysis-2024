This is how our current era will end. Individual selfish politicians looking to increase their power at the expense of the system, and thinking that it couldn't possibly collapse or even worse, just not caring.
I think those people realize that it doesn't matter if everyone else is poorer, as long as they themselves get richer.
I think it is more than that, I think there is a feeling that if other people are prosperous it somehow makes the rich less rich (even if their objective financial value hasnâ€™t changed).
Money up top isn't just about living a comfortable lifestyle or having decently nice things, it's about the ability to wield influence and holding power, a social structure based on being more or less wealthy than the other guy, and not just having "nice" things but rare things. The social structure varies depending on how much money you have. Just having the money itself really isn't what matters, because everyone in your circle has that money. At that point, you need other ways to put yourself up top. Networking and power.
