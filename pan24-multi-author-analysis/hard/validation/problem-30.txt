I mean, politics aside, Russia was a top tourist destination. Not much to see in Qatar apart from desert. It’s also close to Europe, so it’s much easier for Europeans to travel to.
shows that Brazil had 6.4M in 2019 vs Russia’s 24.4. Russia received four times the tourists Brazil received, so no Russia is more popular. But that could also be attributed to its close proximity to Europe (Europeans get lots of paid holidays and have higher GDP per capita so they can easily afford traveling overseas).
I didn’t watch a single game of Qatar WC. I know what this WC succeeded at: showing me how ugly the Qatar RF really is (which I didn’t care to research before) and letting me know I should never visit.
I wonder if anyone in the comments criticizing or making fun of Qatar actually knows anyone who's been there, instead of just regurgitating western propaganda.
Maybe Qatari official$ con$tantly mole$ting women in the name of mode$ty might reduce the number of visitor$? Just throwing that out there.
