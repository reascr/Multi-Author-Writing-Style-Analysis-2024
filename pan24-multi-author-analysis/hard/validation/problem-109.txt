And at uni levels, really all levels, but uni especially, the goal of reading isn’t to agree with what is written, to conform to what it says. You don’t read Frankenstein to agree to reanimate corpses. Rather, to analyze and discuss who wrote it, why it was written, when and where it was written, what else was being written at the time, an analysis of the analogies, the social commentary (without expressly agreeing), etc. Hell, a well-stated critique on clearly defined grounds would likely be lauded.
Students can either select a different elective if a class syllabus has a book they don’t want to read or a topic they abhor, or… nothing requires them to major in a topic they don’t agree with.
I assume (pre uni level) that if a particular parent didn’t want their child to read a given book, almost all schools would find an alternative book for that lesson, or would accommodate in some way.
It’s because parents that are against banning books are working at their jobs, taking care of their children and generally being responsible. The only way we fight this is figuring out how to make it so that people can be responsible AND as loud as republican complainers.
With the Republican party, he has other people doing most of the ground work, but them he puts his name on it.
