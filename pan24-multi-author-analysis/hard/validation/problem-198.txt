Bout is infamous for doing the latter. What makes him special is that he's a smuggler. Practically anybody can be a middleman and buy weapons on behalf of their country. But he was special because he could sell Soviet weapons to places that have arms embargos by hiding the arms alongside his legitimate legal cargo.
That's a good point, I hadn't even considered that yet. Russia is well-known for using social media as a weapon, so this was likely all planned from the start.
IMO there's a very small chance that he goes back into arms smuggling. Russia is likely not interested in selling its remaining weapons, and they don't really need any help getting their weapons transported to the theater of war, since it's right at their doorstep.
He could theoretically serve as a middleman for Russia to purchase weapons illegally or to supply them to groups that support Russia’s interests in Europe or the rest of the world. I’m guessing the US government is banking on him not being able to do that effectively anymore, which seems likely to be the case, but who knows. I think it’s more likely this is just some sort of a PR play by Russia because the headline makes the US look bad.
