It varies. In my company, we have 3 sick days which are added to our PTO. If we don't get sick, we have 3 extra days of PTO (that will even roll over). We are changing this on the new year, we are giving everyone an extra week of PTO, and turning those 3 days into legit sick days.
If you are out sick, you can’t retroactively use a PTO day to cover it? I’ve never heard of a company that doesn’t have a mechanism for that.
I think a lot of developed countries work that way. I don’t even mind the system we use so long as people have adequate PTO that builds up over years. Starting at none like you mention is crazy, but reading in to it, a lot of workers start at 10-15 days, too, but still probably hard to use them as you mention.
I do hear you tho. I wish Congress had the votes to do it but they don’t unfortunately. Doing nothing (leading to the strike) would also be a disaster. Shame the rail workers are getting caught in the middle.
Here’s something I don’t see being discussed much. In most industries in America, for better or for worse, sick time is bundled in to general PTO. In my industry it’s 3.5 weeks to start typically, going to 5 with time. Sounds like the rail workers have a similar deal, but have the weird points system. What they want is an additional 15 days sick time on top of the PTO. This would be more like how Europe PTO/sick leave works. Everyone is making it sound like rail workers have no PTO but this isn’t quite true. God I’d love to have 15 days of sick leave on top of five weeks PTO. We’re employee owned though, we set our own policy, and that is not a realistic policy even for us.
