Old school brute force DDoS attacks are very unlikely to be effective in the modern day, no matter how much money you throw at it.
Modern DDoS need to be much more sophisticated to be successful. Most will rely on reflection or amplification techniques rather than brute force, but it's still an ineffective attack method with modern DDoS mitigation techniques.
Not accurate. CloudFlare, for example, provides DDoS protection for pretty cheap and has millions of customers that use it.
Even the most basic DDoS protection from pretty much any cloud provider would be able to mitigate that.
I understand how DDoS protection works. It’s something that always intrigued me ever since gaming platform was hit off during holiday (Very sad times). What system is completely DDoS proof? Not trying to be rude, but in csec we never speak in such absolutes. Before I go diving into the theoretical power of a state sponsored cyber warfare unit and imagine what a successful DDoS attack against an enterprise cloudflare client would involve, I have to ask… have you really sat down and thought about it? Are we just disagreeing on what the term “DDoS proof” means?
Is this even a DDOS? Or is it more along the lines of a reddit kiss of death. You have something major happen. People go to the site in mass to figure out what it means. Site ends up with 100x more traffic than what it usually gets and it shits the bed.
