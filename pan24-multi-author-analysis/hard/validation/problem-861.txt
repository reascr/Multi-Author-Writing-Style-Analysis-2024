It didn't go quite that well. Sweden announced they'd send like $700K in aid (which isn't a lot of money for the size of this damage) and now they're asking for Turikye to open up their border with Syria to allow for refugees to receive aid in Turikye.
Not really the same thing. Turikye has been at war with Syria for a few years now actively carrying out missions in Syria to stop anti-Turikye insurgent groups that are attempting to take over regional power. They've closed their borders and made it insanely difficult for Syrians to immigrate or claim refugee status over security concerns.
You can ignore that because it doesn't have anything to do with the modern tensions between the state of Turikye and Armenia. The current tensions are based on the fact that there's a Cold War collapse state next to Turikye... and Turikye aligned with NATO whereas Armenia continues to align with Russia.
When Ukraine's enemy is a country that now you got 12 wars against them and the 11th one is called the Tenth Russo-Turkish War I feel Turkey would do a lot to stick it to Russia.
I think if there was no war in Ukraine Russia would have still helped out with the earthquake in Turkey cuz these are two unrelated events. And these two countries have a close relationship plus they aren't that far from eachother, so it would make sense for them to help eachother. I don't understand why this is being politicised here?
