We already know how far a small cheap combustion engine drone with a bomb attached to it can travel, from watching what's been happening in the Ukraine.
What happens if China or Russia sends a dormant military drone across the ocean under a balloon, then detaches the balloon and flies the drone around independently, using their own military satellite communication systems?
Since it sounds like the first balloon widely reported may have been big enough to carry an actual bus, multiple drones could travel attached to a single large balloon and gradually separate from it in stages.
A balloon that you can program in the coordinates and fly exactly to your desired destination is impressive technology. Usually balloons just fly to wherever the currents send them.
It is all about balloons. My balloon is better than your balloon. I fly my balloon first. My balloon isn't like your balloon.
Why are balloons so scary though? Why am I supposed to be afraid and angry that countries are launching balloons in high altitudes? Balloons that are easily shot down and detected?
Why is the west talking as if this was some sort of an existential threat to the American hegemony over the world?
