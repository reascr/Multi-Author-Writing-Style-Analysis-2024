There are a lot of sub-issues here. First of all is that the older the munition the exponentially less useful it is. These things, if not stored correctly, become dangerous to move and handle over time. At some point Russia will reach a point where these weapons are hitting them more than the Ukrainian.
Second, older weapons are shorter range and you push back the amount of Ukrainian territory in Russia's range.
But old dumb artillery with a range under 50 km can't destroy civilian targets in Odessa, Kyiv and other cities and villages west of the frontlines.
You do make good counterpoints, but those older munitions are doing the job they were designed to do -- the number of villages and cities leveled in Ukraine is sickening. They have tons more dumb artillery to keep at this for a long time. Russia has more of a manpower problem than weapons.
On the positive side, the weapons NATO is supplying are destroying Russian weapons. The arguments against supplying 4 weapons that Ukraine wants doesn't make sense. Ukraine has said that they would tell NATO beforehand what the targets of ATACMS would be. If NATO believes Western fighter planes and tanks would be too complicated to Ukraine, why does Ukraine want them? Start training Ukrainians and have them decide. The Patriot air defense system is available to supply.
