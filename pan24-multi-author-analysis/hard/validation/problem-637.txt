It’s one think you wake up in the dark at 6am it’s a whole nothing thing having your morning commute in pitch darkness with snow and ice when your barely awake and kids are walking to school and stuff.
I never underwood why people make such a big deal about it. Like the whole year they never went to sleep an hour late or had to wake up an hour early?
You'd be waking up and starting work at the same time either way, the clock would just show a diffrent time.
But in your suggestion, a couple posts up, employers would literally be changing the time when work starts, so yeah, they would have to get up at an earlier clock time.
I might be slightly happier if we stopped changing the clocks, but I find myself with literally the “young kids going to school in the morning” consideration. They walk about a quarter mile, and I pass families walking their kids up to half a mile. If we didn’t change the clocks back to standard, they’d be walking before sunrise part of the year. And if we didn’t switch back to daylight savings, I wouldn’t get to enjoy long evenings in the summer. So I deal with walking around my house for a few minutes updating clocks, and feeling a bit out of sorts for a day or two.
