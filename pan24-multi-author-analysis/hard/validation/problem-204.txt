You're right but you want that decline to be _gradual_ and to actually stop at some point. Neither of those things seem like they are going to be true for the places starting to see population crash on the horizon. You'd think they'd allow immigration to alleviate the problem but many of the places facing the worst crashes are also super anti-immigration so good luck with all that to those countries.
You'd think so but the data tells us that the higher the standard of living in a country the fewer children people have. This is consistent across the planet, every culture. People say "folks aren't having kids because they can't afford it" but that really doesn't seem to be how it works. Higher standard of living = fewer kids.
If you want population growth, you need lower costs of living, higher wages, better health care, etc.
I know people in their late 30s who waited to have kids until they got better jobs or were able to buy a house. Sure, some people just have kids they can't really afford, but some others who would otherwise have them won't or won't have as many.
Yup, but don't say that while you're making enough money to afford it but don't want to sacrifice luxury or lifestyle that is unsustainable with children üëç.
Just because some people make poor financial decisions (choosing to have a child without being financially stable or able to afford it) doesn't mean everyone has to.
You seem to be implying that there is an obligation to have children and people who are determining that their finances don't allow for it are somehow shirking responsibility. That isn't the case and isn't how raising children should be viewed.
