Quick Edit - Maybe California's law won't pass constitutional muster if challenged either. Which I'm sure it will be. And there's 12 years before 2035. Who knows what kind of new battery tech may exist or if major brands will even make non EV's anymore.
One of the biggest challenges facing EVs is the limited range of the batteries. While many modern EVs can travel over 200 miles on a single charge, this is still not enough for long-distance travel or for those who live in rural areas with limited charging options. Until the range of EVs can be extended, it will be difficult for them to replace gasoline-powered vehicles as the primary mode of transportation.
To be clear, I agree that few if any living more than an hour from a freeway or highway would want an EV, though if they have electricity so far from such roadways, they should be able to recharge at home, no?
In the longer term, IF reliable FUSION power becomes economical, then I figure EVs are likely to become so much cheaper than internal combustion engines that even Wyoming voters would figuratively flay any state legislator who kept them from saving money by using EVs.
There are times one must ponder the benefits of Yellowstone blowing up, thus forcing GAWD to start over with Wyoming (and Idaho and Montana if not nearly all the US west of the Mississippi).
