Caste systems aren't exclusive to India or Hinduism. It affects other countries (e.g. Pakistan and Bhutan) and other religions (Muslims, Sikh, Buddhists) as well. Banning caste systems in general doesn't go against any specific religion or ethnicity.
Caste-based discrimination is a serious issue, and I have never argued otherwise. We have endured a lot of hardship in the past as a result of this practise, so it is more than just a problem. But I don't believe that discrimination like this occurs in Seattle. There is no concrete proof of this claim. Sawant is promoting her unlawful caste proposal to target the South Asians.
What should I do, exactly? Should I have to bring it up every time I speak? what do you want exactly? There is always the possibility that some other communities will have greater privileges than yours, and you may have to deal with prejudice there, which is something that happens more frequently. Where will this downward spiral eventually lead? Because there are more hierarchical structures than humans could possibly enumerate, discrimination between humans does not always result from community status, despite the fact that it is frequently the main factor. And based on the way you are speaking, I don't believe you want to stop this obscene tradition. You want other people to express regret for crimes they didn't even commit. You are getting a subconscious pleasure that somehow you are fighting for the casteism atrocities but in the mean while I think you are damaging more than anyone else you are more casteist than an average Brahmin.
I've never thought of my Caste as being "high" or "superior" at any level, either. It's a complicated matter, so if you want to understand why individuals like Sawant are targeting the South Asians in Seattle, you should read about caste and as well as about the caste-based reservation system.
Sawant even went so far as to argue that we don't even need studies! She would simply brand South Asians as casteists and instruct Seattle Council to trust her and her allies, disregarded the opinions of the vast majority of people who really live and work in Seattle.
