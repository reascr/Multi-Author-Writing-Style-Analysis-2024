Yes the Jan 6 terrorists were a mixed group of people but successful would only describe a minority. There are a lot who had previous gun and/or domestic violence charges. There were more than a few severely mentally disturbed. Most of them only got to DC because of outside funding. Most of them are racists. Not many are well educated. What all of them are is gullible people who got brainwashed and fell for the con just like Jim Jones followers did. Instead of drinking poison they attacked the US government and destroyed their lives.
If Republican mocs had stood their ground from their first statements after the attack instead of slithering back to the antichrist we would be recovering. Never forget the Republicans who are as responsible for the destruction of America as trump is.
To these Republicans if you are not one of them you are an enemy of the nation and the people. People need to get this through their heads.
This won’t improve if economic conditions get better, the price of gas is unrelated to this delusion, they will move on to the next thing to glare at, real or imagined. The only way to put an end to this insanity is for the rest of the nation, the other 70%, to vote them out of any and all power, which will force their hand to try and seize power through violent means and then you crush the movement once and for all.
Republican voters, by and large, do not see you as a fellow American if you do not believe as they do, support who they do or speak as they do. If you aren’t constantly reenforcing their worldview back to them, you are actively, intentionally and maliciously trying to undermine their country in their minds. Again, this is their country, not all of ours, to them only they are the real Americans.
