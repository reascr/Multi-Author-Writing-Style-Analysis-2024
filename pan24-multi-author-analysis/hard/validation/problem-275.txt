Putin could see that part of the reason Russia was doing so badly in Ukraine was because of the duplicated command structures and political infighting to secure favour.
It's a massive task coordinating something like that amongst militaries that trust each other (e.g., NATO) but it's impossible when the commanders of your separate militaries hate each other more than the enemy they're fighting.
Putin has presumably only combined everything under one roof temporarily so that he can try to squeeze some more cohesion out of his military for the sake of a war that's gone badly BADLY wrong for him.
Seems like Putin is trying to solve multiple things at once: diminish Wagner by cutting off ammo and new prisoner recruits, while also using them to soak up Ukranian bullets.
I wonder if Putin doesnâ€™t want to give them too many supplies as Wagner would quickly be a better fighting force then the Russian army or at least potentially a stronger force.
Putin can't allow Wagner PMC to be too much "efficient" in the battlefield in a level that it would obscure the Russian army, it could threaten his power base. That's the thing with dictatorships, "give a man too many battles and a man will forget who is the king".
