So there is evidence she groomed and had sex with them, but the GOP protected her by essentially saying "she only had sex with them a little, so you shouldn't punish. Instead, let her run for office again.".
Yep. To them a social worker must be doing it for the money but explain that they don't make much and they will pivot to something like they only do it because they can't get better jobs or they must have another, bad, motivation.
My sister believes this all to often. She is a liberal (I'm far left ideologically compared to her) but her and her husband work a lot. A lot of people have their heads in the sand. They think it can't be true because the GOP is hiding behind the absurd... Tell me has there ever been a politician that could have mocked a disabled person live on tv and still get elected? Not since before civil rights. Clinton was impeached for lying about a blow job and whale mocked endlessly for misspelling potato.
Use differences in the Christian sects against each other. Force them to say that the rules and beliefs of all their different sects are equal.... They can't all be right...
