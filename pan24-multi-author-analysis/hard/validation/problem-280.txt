I have actually a long time had this issue with Amnesty, they have a lot of valid criticisms but they hold people to a ridiculously high standard which dilutes their message.
Nah, they have a long time criticized Russia. I had plenty of issues with their report on Ukraine (they had padded the report with things which are not war crimes to make Ukraine look bad) but they have written more reports about Russia than about Ukraine.
Even if it's true that Amnesty was criticizing Russia for a long time, the fact remains that they made Ukraine out to be the bad guys in the headlines while Russia was attempting to take the country.
I know everyone still remembers that idiotic article a while ago, but it has to be said that Amnesty International has written plenty of articles against Russia before that too. It's not like they're only now changing their tune.
They still deserve all the ridicule and scorn for that dumb an article. Which was not only based on dodgy information, but also just written poorly.
