Criminal referrals from Congress are a sticky subject. They don't inherently carry any legal teeth to them and are also kind of a "damned if you don't" action by the public, which Schiff is trying to get ahead of here.
And if it isn't directly regarding a crime related to Congress (contempt, witness tampering, obstruction, etc.) or evidence that the DOJ doesn't already have, some members have suggested it risks politicizing a potential legal process.
It's basically just a political process that is voted on by a committee to say "DOJ, please do something about this evidence that a crime that has been committed".
Does the DoJ have a duty to investigate cases where they know (or have been told by another high authority, like congress) that crimes have been committed?
I would assume and hope that when Congress finds evidence of criminal activity the DOJ should investigate, the process would be to refer that information to the DOJ. Not doing so because of risk of being perceived as politicizing a political process is what is politicizing a legal process.
