What does anything they say matter? Finland and Sweden made an agreement with the Turkish government. They were doing what Turkey wanted them to do, and I'm sure that deal didn't have any clause saying "if some nutbag burns a koran, all bets are off!".
Pffffft. They went in and fought against the Kurds. They weren't fighting against Russia or Syria, they were fighting for them. And Libya is still a mess.
We have long range missile systems that are accurate enough that NATO can close that down with or without Turkish assistance.
Turkey really wants to buy modern aircraft and missile defense systems. That will never happen and Turkey can go fuck itself for a long time coming, but they haven't figured that out yet.
Anyhow, turkey will pretty much be Iraq in a decade or so and we will have a whole other problem then.
Yeah turkey basically did what every corrupt dirty state does. First they lied to Sweden and Finland about a smooth process. Then they suddenly produced a list with outlandish demands. Then they tried to curb the very freedoms a NATO membership is meant to protect.
