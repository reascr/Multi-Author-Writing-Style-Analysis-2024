The worst part is that turnout in urban areas (the largest being Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati) decreased from 2018.
It’s incredible that a federal court is letting this stand and that the Supreme Court is letting this happen.
If we can overwhelmingly pass a constitutional amendment to ban partisan gerrymandering and then they do it anyway and the courts don’t stop them, do we even have a democracy anymore in Ohio?
The plan in Ohio is even more nefarious, though, because people _will_ still get to vote, it just needs to garner 60% or more of the vote if it's to add a constitutional amendment. So folks will still be able to get these initiatives on a ballot, but given Ohio has swung pretty far right this means more progressive items likely stand little chance of passing. Literally 40.1% of anyone who shows up to vote for a given issue can tank the will of a pretty damn big majority of Ohioans.
It's a complete fucking shit show here in Ohio in recent years, to the point I have seriously wondered if the future of my family resides in this state.
