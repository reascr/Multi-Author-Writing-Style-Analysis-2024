I suppose destroying weapons might have merit but then the US Navy would not be a navy at all. Would save the US a lot of money if we just stopped spending money procuring weapons for the Navy.
Seizing goods on the high seas is piracy. It being approved by national or international law does not make the piracy not be piracy. Pirates taking cargo that is considered contraband is piracy of contraband.
If they stole the weapons from a ship that was carrying them legally and then sold them, then I could see piracy but not this.
They seized illegal weapons from ships that were illegally smuggling guns. Now, instead of destroying the weapons, they want to give them to Ukraine. Now, if they are just "donating" those weapons to be included in one of the next aid packages, how is that piracy?
I'm confused.. How is it piracy for them to seize illegal weapons from gun runners and donate them to Ukraine? Serious question as I know nothing about piracy?
How can this not be piracy? Obviously if the word holds negative connotation then we can invent positive words. Maybe "high seas capture of freedom prize"?
