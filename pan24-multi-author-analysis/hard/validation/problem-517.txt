Us doing it is different, though. All it does is in our case is enable the opposition to have opportunities to sway more people in their direction, because they can use facts to control a narrative in ways you wouldn't want or expect.
And the idea that they "like candidates that violently try to overturn peaceful election" is based on one incident with one man during a period when, yes, the MAGA crowd was completely batshit. Not a majority, but large enough to do damage.
Yes, the wave itself is very concerning, but the reality is significantly different from what this statement says.
Democrats being more intelligent through leveraging buffoon republicans (by giving republicans more rope to hang themselves with) in order to smokescreen their own areas of corruption doesn't make them innocent.
I find it so aggravating that Republicans largely want to get elected simply so they can disrupt the government from functioning and helping the people just to make Democrats look bad so hopefully voters put them back in power later.
