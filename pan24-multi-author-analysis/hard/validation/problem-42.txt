If he was on Depreska's payroll then how much of what he delivered Mueller was garbage? And who else was getting paid?
He literally got the job as counter intelligence chief six weeks after Mueller announced the Russia investigation would look into Trump.
This is the guy that was in charge of the investigation into Trumps ties to Russia before the electoral college decided he was president.
This is the guy that investigated Trump under Mueller and declared that Trump had no connections to Russia. This exact guy.
At this point, anyone who was either installed in a high position or held any sort of legal oversight position during the Trump years should be investigated. Keep shining the light further and further back into these dark corners, expose the rats and hunt them down, they are traitors to what this nation stands for.
If you want any more example of how thoroughly Russian foreign intelligence infiltrated our government and corrupted our processes, this is it. This guy was paid by Deripaska (i.e. Putin) to give that "investigation" a clean wipe, no matter what it actually found, if they actually bothered to try to find anything in the first place.
