It's disingenuous to say that Reagan was just an actor. He had been involved in California politics for decades, and he was governor of California for 8 years. During those eight years, he raised taxes, turned the state budget from a deficit to a surplus and helped implement a lot of the policies that made Cali a successful liberal state today.
Once he got to DC, he got sucked into the Nixonian miasma that the late-70's GOP had become. Reagan was a bad president, but the factors that made him a bad president were institutional rather than something inherent to him.
In fact, the article's timeline is incorrect. Using the Reagan administration as the starting point for the GOP's degradation is totally wrong. That really started with Nixon, and it was the result of decades of terrible foreign policy decisions.
Nixon history is wiped out by Watergate but it was much worse. He won, largely because he promised to win the Vietnam War. Peace with honor. Sounds good, right? Instead he sabotaged LBJ peace talks.
Completely untrue. TV was limited, people didn't have cable. Our "big screen" was a 12 inch black& white tv! Two channels and one was terrible because of bad reception. TV towers just didn't have anything close to the reception they have now. We definitely didn't watch tv much. It was a special treat. Do you really believe the nonsense that everyone was glued to the tv? Sheesh. Maybe it was true on the completely fictional tv channels you watched lol.
I'm not saying that people watched a lot of TV. I'm saying that people weren't as critical of television and commercials when they did watch. When they watched, they watched.
