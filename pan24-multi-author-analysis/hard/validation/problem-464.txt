For me the core difference between legalising weed and mushrooms.. pills, etc.. vs things like heroine and cocaine is how addictive they are. Do you go full ham and not limit people’s use of it if it’s legal? That’ll go wrong - look at the opioid problem big farma caused handing out much weaker opioids like candy. Do you restrict them to certain amounts per person? Same problem but now you’re just recruiting en masse for the illegal drug trade.
The problem with the US crisis was when they cut people off and left them to seek illegal means. I don't see how the stuff is any less addictive than alcohol and tobacco, but when we cut people off alcohol it was a crisis too.
The point if I'm not mistaken is to provide clean substances so that addicts won't risk buying product cut with fent. Comes from a place of empathy & saves lives, but looks really ass backwards. Not to mention- if these drugs are freely available while deemed illegal, cartels profit off of sales instead of US businesses & US government (from taxing sales). Sounds cray but you can cut the cartel off financially somewhat w this avenue.
