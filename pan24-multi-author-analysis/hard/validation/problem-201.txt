I recall reading about a case of transmission of CJD from a cornea transplant, from one human to another. I am not an expert on this disease, but considering its severity, i would err on the side of caution and not take chances with blood donation.
We have to keep in mind that people receiving the blood are not healthy to begin with so anything that gets transmitted could very likely be lethal.
I think this whole discussion about not excluding gay people from donating is a result of better tests which can detect earlier, better medication which lessens the consequences of catching HIV and a general decline in HIV cases in the population and gay men.
I don't think it was discriminating to generally exclude higher risk groups from donating. Speaking from experience you get denied from donating for a lot of things even if there is only a very small risk of transmitting anything.
It does, afaik it even gets tested multiple times but the tests can't detect HIV in the first few days/weeks after infection.
Worst case scenario, the test fails to catch it and someone receives HIV tainted blood. All tests fail. Current estimates are about 1 in a million blood transfusions in the US are with HIV tainted blood. Which might not sound like a lot but given how many blood transfusions happen each year, itâ€™s definitely still causing tragedies.
blood tests are done in batches and in some cases not done at all ( at least where I am), there was a huge issue in the 90s with people getting hep from blood transfusions. so, if you allow a high risk demographic to donate ((gay males being the highest), you will have to waste large amounts of donated blood.
