Videos in the years before the invasion show Russia using western precision rifles to engage Ukrainians. Oddly enough it was funny to see how well put together that small Russian team of soldiers were compared to what we are seeing now.
Not really sure how much combat footage there is on the sub right now showing Russian SOF this well kitted or even shooting western precision rifles much at all. I frequent combatfootage as well as other subs and sources to find footage and don't see much of it at all, would be harder to find as i don't think Russian SOF teams aren't letting as much footage see the light of day at this time.
There’s plenty of Russian sabotage & recon teams out there, not sure why you think it isn’t happening just because it’s not mainstream news. Plenty of combat footage and telegram reports of these kinds of operations, even shows the sniper rifles being used.
It takes away from what Ukrainians have faced and accomplished because there’s probably a lot of conventional forces and territorial defense who had to battle Russian special forces due to their frequent use in direct action roles.
While the it's true that the Ukrainians did the actual fighting, NATO supplied anti tank weapons to Kiev before and during the first days of the invasion.
Dude your going on a guy saying there was more videos before, and then you say, there was more videos before 😁You have to look harder😁.
