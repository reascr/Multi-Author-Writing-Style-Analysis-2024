First: We did resist. Since the start of the war and throughout 2022, the police in Russia arrested almost 20,000 opponents of the war. According to human rights groups, protests have taken place almost every day in different cities since February 24, 2022, and only 18 of those days have passed without arrests and detentions. Against this background, we have seen astonishing examples of civil courage. For instance, Vladimir Rumyantsev, a provincial fireman, got three years in prison for building a ham radio to broadcast reports against the war, while Alexei Gorinov, a member of the Moscow city council, got seven years after he called for a minute of silence during a meeting of that chamber to honor the Ukrainian children who had been killed.
Not even to mention my favorite musician Yuri Shevchuk who publicly condemned the war and Putin, and his pretty big audience applaud to him and still quotes his phrase: "The motherland, my friends, is not the president’s ass that has to be slobbered and kissed all the time".
I want to appeal to the wisdom of the international community. Do not demean the Russians, as that kind of rhetoric will only strenhen Putin’s power. By shifting the blame for war crimes from the Kremlin junta onto my fellow citizens, you are easing the Putin regime’s moral and political burden. You are giving him a chance to hide from the just accusations of people who have in essence become a human shield in this situation. I see that as a serious mistake.
I'm afraid you are missing the point. If any free state did a 180⁰ turn and invaded a neighbour, the people of said state wouldn't have it. Instead ask yourself if you would come to Russia and speak out. Of course, you have no idea how many people would come with you. That's always a problem. And what would it change, you might ask yourself. They will just throw me in jail. Besides, it is not your country, let someone else do it. And so on and so forth.
