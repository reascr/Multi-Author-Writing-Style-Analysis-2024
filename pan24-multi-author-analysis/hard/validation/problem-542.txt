The 18% was unsustainable and frankly unfair to the rest of the country. So it was both out of practicality (lower interest rate is still better than none in the case of bankrupting the funds) and making public servant benefits a little more in line with broader society.
But taking a step back and looking at reality, the alternative would’ve been the funds go bankrupt and don’t get paid out. “It should be honored,” sure, but how? A restructuring was long overdue, and though unpopular, I’d argue it was very necessary.
It’s a somewhat understandable but also really irrational sentiment. I also have family members affected by this policy.
I have family members affected by this (or another policy change similar to this). Retired teachers. Pensions almost cut in half AFTER retirement, and as their only source of income after retirement. One of them thinks it’s injustice to drastically change their pensions after having worked 30+ years as a public school teacher. Thinks something that’s written down on paper shouldn’t be changed. They now have a fervent hatred for the tw government and sometimes jokes about welcoming ccp rule since they believe the ccp won’t fuq with their pensions. Says if tw falls to the ccp it would be its own government’s fault.
