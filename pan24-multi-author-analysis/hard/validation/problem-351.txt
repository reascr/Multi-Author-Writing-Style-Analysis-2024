To be honest her party DID kill the complete solar cell industry in germany which lead to solar becoming such a minor player in germany's energy plans.
In tandem with the EU that ditched protective tarifs after other EU countries complained that only Germany was profiting (since they were the only EU country with a large domestic solar industry).
Or is Russia controlling Germany to be one of the few countries to impose even more oil sanctions than the EU could decide on (together with Poland)? Maybe they are controlling Germany to take in a million Ukrainian refugees? Or they are controllin Germany to be one of the top 5 countries giving Ukraine military aid? Maybe they also controlled Germany to halt NS2 __two days before__ the invasion? Or they controlled Germany to get rid of Russian gas imports in less than a year?
Do you think Russia supplying gas to China instead of EU makes Russia more or less afraid of EU sanctions? I think Russia cares less about EU sanctions if Russia mostly sells gas to China. Note also in the real world EU has imposed many more restrictions on Russia, leverage from energy supply be damned, than China has.
What I wonder is why they became so dependent on Russian energy in the first place when they should've seen this coming. France for example used to be heavily invested in nuclear energy, had the cheapest energy in europe and exported it to their neighbors and even they have moved away from that. Likely for political reasons. If germany and other EU countries heavily invested in nuclear 20, even 10 years ago this situation with russia wouldn't be so messy. Demand for Russian resources has made sanctions ineffective and allowed russia to write off(default on) their debt and finance this war by selling resources in rubles to BRIC and OPEC countries.
