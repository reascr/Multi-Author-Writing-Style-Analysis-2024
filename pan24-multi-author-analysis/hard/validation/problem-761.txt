It's a common tactic many countries use. Turn the people against each other so that they don't turn against you. We are seeing this play out in the United States right now. Turning the population against itself so that they don't realize that the government is the true problem.
Once people who live under theocratic authoritarian governments get what they want they will keep asking for more and more and more. This is why the leaders hardly ever bend or break. Because as soon as you overturn one policy it opens the flood gates.
Step 5: use your military to stop the violence. Tell the world you are trying to stop the "violent hardliners" while you really go after those who have been protesting.
They wouldn't have done this if they had any choice, they're going to find a way to save face and then give the protesters what they want and ensure everyone shuts up.
They're not going to secretly come after the protesters because if they've done this, it's because they were seriously afraid of being toppled, which means there are too many to punish.
