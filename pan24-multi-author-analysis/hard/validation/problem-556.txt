Railroad owners knew Congress and Biden had their back. They knew they never had to negotiate in good faith. Why give Rail workers time off when they didn't have too? If Rail companies knew Congress would prevent a strike, then the union never had any leverage and the Rail companies counted on it.
The law putting the rail workers union under the power of the government is what needs to be addressed. That power forces the hand of all in government to sacrifice the few for the good of the many. Democrats were never going to have the votes for additional sick days, even without a filibuster, as was seen by the sick day votes. They made the call to get them what they could before the house switches parties and the rail workers would get less after the economy suffered. The Rail Bosses and Republicans would happily let Americans suffer for a month while pressure mounted on Biden to fix it. Until the power is taken out of governments hands to intervene rail workers are at a severe disadvantage unless Dems hold a super majority.
