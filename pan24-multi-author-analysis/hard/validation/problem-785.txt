Found the article somewhere else . Looks like he ended up back in Russia somehow and was made an example of . Poor sod . Actually , reading more , it appears that he was involved in a prisoner exchange . That's fucked up .
That's my point you fuckwit. Why would someone joke about Russia forcing US prisoners that were unjustly acquitted to fight against Ukraine and you people are making a joke of it. How does that not make sense? It was HER that the previous commenter brought up, and I stated that it's not cool to joke about forcing US citizens in Russian prison to fight against Ukraine? How the fuck are you both so dense to not understand what I meant? I swear everyone reddit is brain dead.
Because she's a US POW essentially? She's being held and Russia won't negotiate an exchange? Because I care far more about some random US WNBA player than some fucking corrupt foreign legion full of actual shit people and she's on there for a fucking weed vape. Why would you want her to fight? Y'all are a bunch of fucking idiots.
