After all, the evil mewling fuckhead in charge already denied federal assistance while taking another payout from his railroad buddies. If the people of East Palestine want support, they need to neutralize their governor and his supporters, otherwise they're screwed.
Considering that even if Biden was there, pen in hand, to order the gears to turn on aid and support, the collection of vile filth and worthless, evil scum that is every republican would resist and impede the aid efforts, going to Ukraine actually gets stuff done.
I'd hazard a guess that when the next round of Ukraine aid comes to a vote the list of those opposing it will be nearly identical to those complaining about Biden's trip.
Of course they don't like it. It is a sign of effective international leadership on Biden's part, brings comfort to Ukrainians, and hurts the efforts of Putin to divide Ukraine's supporters.
So they can visit Moscow on the 4th of July but if Biden visits Ukraine to show support and solidarity, it's alligator tears.
