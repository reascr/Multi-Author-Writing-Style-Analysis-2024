The new thing is that they are no longer capable of being in it for themselves, either. They are simply unable to wield power because their internal factions are at each other’s throats.
The Republicans are unable to Govern for a myriad of reasons. The fact that they are debating who should be speaker rather that receiving a dictate from on high and marching in lockstep is not one of them.
So I gree that Republicans are unable to govern, but "Republicans are having a debate and not just marching in lockstep" is certainly not the reason.
If they can’t get together over the Speakership, the next two years will just be a non-stop cat fight over everything and the Democrats will just recruit some of the smarter Republicans to get things done. Because there won’t be a Republican Party coherent enough to be worth belonging to.
Republican voters never seem to realize it’s their party that prevents any level of government from functioning. And who benefits when government isn’t working? Billionaires.
