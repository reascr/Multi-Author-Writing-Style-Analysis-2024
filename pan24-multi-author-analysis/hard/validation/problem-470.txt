Suppose I'm tired of the pussyfooting we've done around Russia for so many years, and think they are all complicit in their crimes. The German deathcamp convictions come to mind, everyone was following orders and they weren't even doing the actual killing. But by helping the machine function, or even just by not trying to stop it, you are partly responsible for its output.
There were plenty of passive silent people in all horrible regimes, just wanting to live their normal life.
I completely agree the jokes are tiring, however I also think we can call all passive Russians complicit, even if standing up would result in their detention or death.
In other words, even taking at face value your assertion that it's only gallows humor "when you're the one on the gallows," we are all kind of on the gallows in some sense when people like Putin run the world. What can you do besides laugh at that? And why police people who want to derive a bit of black humor out of what's otherwise a depressing situation?
