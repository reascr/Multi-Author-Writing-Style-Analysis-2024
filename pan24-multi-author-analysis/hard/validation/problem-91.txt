Lithium mining is still incredibly dirty and toxic to local environments unfortunately. On top of that, you're making yourself reliant on the next generation of despots as you start running out of domestic Lithium supplies and have to import. The only real solution is Nuclear power.
No one is talking about minituriased nukes for cars, for good reason, and yet our cars use as much energy as our houses.
Nuclear isn't taking off like renewables are for a reason. Some of it is down to unfounded fears, sure, but the main factor is simply that it costs more to build slower. It doesn't offer the same bang for your buck that solar and wind do. Now that's not to say that nuclear is bad or useless, just that as renewables are in this explosive growth phase and continue to get cheaper they're going to justifiably be the focus. Alternatives like nuclear, hydro, and thermal are still important to keep the grid stable because expecting to bruteforce our way to victory using a fuck-ton of grid-scale battery packs is silly. Build some of those alternatives on the side. And if you already have them? Where possible, keep 'em!
I just wish people stopped acting like nuclear was a magic bullet that everyone - scientists, environmentalists, and governments - would have all overlooked if not for Redditors.
