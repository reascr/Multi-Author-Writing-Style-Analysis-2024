How is it possible to believe that she sent those emotional, overwrought texts to Mark Meadows, but didn't discuss anything with her own husband? It's just not plausible.
That's what would happen. The right-wing on the SCOTUS have no interest in lessening their power and there is no mechanism that would keep Thomas off the bench.
Imagine if they tried this and it went all the way to the SCOTUS, Thomas didn't recuse himself, and successfully got the court to drop the subpoena.
In the extremely likely event C. Thomas was involved and there is clear evidence, he should be impeached and criminally tried as well.
The current Supreme Court cannot be taken seriously. It’s members stopped vote counting in Bush v. Gore and one member’s wife sought to play a role in denying the election results. Thomas refused to recuse him from cases in which his own wife was involved.
Why haven’t they questioned him already? Why is he involved in cases related to January 6th when his wife was involved? Why doesn’t he recuse himself?
