What precisely did you think we (if you mean the US) has ever done that hasn’t designed to be inherently it its own interests? (I use the word designed loosely here. It turns out that continually arming and training groups that you know nothing about without even a toddler’s understanding of history or culture or languages or politics turns out to NOT be in your own interest. Pretty much all the time. Oopsie).
What make you think that the people of Iran, protesting and dying since the US and the UK orchestrated a military coup against a popularly elected and leader , don’t want democracy?
Until the democratically elected prime minister didnt work for the agenda of the west by nationalizing the country oil, so the US and UK overthrew him in the 1953 Iranian coup.
Iran almost had such a government in early 1950s until the US government intervened and handed the power back to Shah through a coup.
Like the US supports a thriving democratic government in Iran that only considers the well-being of its people and can influence the citizens of other nations in the region who are currently living under the rule of absolute monarchies to change their government.
