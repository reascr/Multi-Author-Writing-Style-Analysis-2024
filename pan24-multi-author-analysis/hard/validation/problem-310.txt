What you say is fine, but sonnytron is implying opposing politicians should be criminalized for disagreeing with sonnytron's POV. Sounds very authoritarian.
I think the fundamental issue of impeaching a SC Justice is that the electorate is divided from accessing segregated news sources. Politicians serving their electorate is not illegal or bad process.
But go on defending your clearly politised and corrupt court. If gay marriage falls too, I'm sure you'll be here extolling its merits again.
Sure, merits. What a surprise, every Republican on the bench thought that Congress can't levy a tax when a Democrat is in charge, and every Democrat thought Congress has the right to levy taxes. On Roe v Wade, yet another surprise! Republicans thought half a century of precedent was wrong (and lied to the Senate about these views), and Dems thought otherwise.
Ironic how Republicans have been trying to cover this for years but keep saying Democrats are the ones covering things up? I understand why, it just makes me upset how jarring the hypocrisy is.
