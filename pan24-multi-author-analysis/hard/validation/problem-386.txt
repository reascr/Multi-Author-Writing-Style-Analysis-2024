Sullivan confirmed that they sent word to Kremlin that Biden was taking the trip, i.e. it was never a surprise visit.
Missing the point. The notification meant that Putin had ample time to launch an accidental missile strike if he wanted to. I.e. Biden was never in danger and it was just a dumb photo op.
Which has backfired because, quoting another commentator, "The fact the US Secret Service allowed Biden into Kyiv for a stupid photo-op is a tacit admission on how restrained Russia is, and in fact, how trusted the Russians' word is.".
p.s. if this somehow did happen, just saying IF it did happen. I had nothing to do with it. and the man was over 60 years old, he was bound to slip somewhere.
Yeah I have a photo of that too from a Mall Outlet. They do a good job photo shopping your head almost to anything. They got me doing the Stone Cold Stunner on The Rock. . How cool is that?
But why is that? I mean it's not like republicans ever wore shirts saying they'd rather be russian than democrats, right? Not even republicans would be that low.
