There were valid reasons for the Democrats to take the actions they did, and the vote was bipartisan because some Republicans agreed with their actions. This action from Republicans is just revenge politics for the sake of it and there are no valid reasons, for example, to deny Schiff a seat on his old committee or to remove Ilhan from her committee.
This is what’s truly Fascinating about this sub, the Democrats were the first people to throw opposing parties members off committees, they set the precedent.. Than Republicans do the same things and everyone cry’s foul. I’m no fan of the GOP, but damn you can’t be surprised when they return the favor, you don’t get to have it both ways….
Because no Democrats ever advocated for political violence in the last 5 years. Republicans didn’t remove them. They didn’t remove Rashida Talib, Omar for constantly tweeting anti Somatic Rhetoric.
You also don’t seem to understand that Opposition parties throwing people off committees was completely unprecedented in American politics until the Democrats literally did it first..
I’m most active in a Marxist sub…… I think you just have an incredibly tribal view on politics, we’re it’s his team good this team bad.. both parties have done there fair share of dooming this country. If you don’t think Obama and Hillary Clinton are two of the most machiavellian figures in American politics you really need to do yourself a favor and look into both parties.
