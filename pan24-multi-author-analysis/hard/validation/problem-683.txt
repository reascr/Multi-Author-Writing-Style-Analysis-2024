Idk, he might have lost the support of the crazier GOP people in the state and, therefore, might not have had the support of the MA GOP. That combined with people who were unwilling to vote Republican on principle this time around, but did before, I think he would've lost a close race.
Take some solace in the fact that some of those races were only close because of gerrymandering and voter suppression. Although thatâ€™s something to be sad about for different reasons.
That's so sad and hurtful. To have someone you thought was your friend shit talk you in public now and pretend like you were never friends in the first place. From her friend's perspective, that must really sting :/.
McCain was a traditional republican who held many terrible views/opinions. But, we have to give credit where credit is due. He saved the ACA and stood up against the racism that he saw creeping in.
I remember that thumbs down...you could see the senators in the room holding their breath, and Chuck Schumer getting others to watch McCain because he knew.
