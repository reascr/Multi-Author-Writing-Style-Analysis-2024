It is now that the GOP is getting the House, but the law is the law. Trump should’ve been indicted ages ago, anyone else would’ve been. The 4D Chess “bigger picture” is a dangerous canard and Orwellian.
abused the powers of the Presidency (with Bill Barr’s help) to put the kibosh on it and then elected GOP let him get away with it.
Mueller operated under not only a Republican President but the actual subject of his investigation. Mueller did his job, Trump.
Sorry but Mueller did not do his job. If anything all he did was reinforce the ridiculousness of the Republican Party. Given that the justice department operates independent of influence of the president, it also shouldn’t have mattered who was president. He uncovered a crime and chose to uphold a crooked justice department standard of not charging a sitting president while ignoring all the other justice department standards that hurt trump. If we knew what mueller knew I have a feeling some of us might be obligated out of sense of duty to mankind to tell the world just how bad things were to prevent more chaos. He didn’t. Trump went on to stay in power and lead the initial reponse to Covid-19. Hundreds of thousands of people died because of his incompetence and evil and in my opinion that blood is on the hands of all trumps enablers and those who were too much of a coward to stop it.
