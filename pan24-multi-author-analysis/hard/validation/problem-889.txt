The rest of the democrats to a RURAL voter come off as "elitist" or "communist" unless I'm missing any.
Like if they put Adam Schiff in there he'd appeal to 0% of the rural voting group and when you look at a lot of the rural area democrats you're likely looking at a POC. Aside from: Tom O'Halleran, Peter Welch, and Ron Kind who are all kind of... unexciting or hell even well known. You've got like Bennie Thompson and Jim Clyburn who are both pretty damn old (I think they're pretty qualified outside of that - but yeah that's not going to happen). Hell all of these guys are pretty old.
We do need someone younger. Unfortunately, picking a speaker of the house that would actually appeal to the old, white, rural people of the United States wouldn't actually be a democrat, because generally speaking - they don't pick democrats... And it definitely isn't due to race/gender.
Fair enough - but personally embodying the diversity of the Democratic Party, in stark contrast to the lack of diversity in the Republican caucus, may very well be a valuable trait for “uniting the caucus”.
