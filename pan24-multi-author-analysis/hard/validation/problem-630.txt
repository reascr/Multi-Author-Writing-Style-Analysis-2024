Thats the thing though- India doesn’t need to anything that is not directly in line with its geopolitical interests and in the interests of its citizens. Same goes with Ukraine. India has already sent a shitton if humanitarian aid to Ukraine - which is a reasonable contribution from a country which has constantly put forth the narrative on global stage that “this is not our war”.
Regarding the Russian military imports- that is a failure of historical US diplomacy which pushed india into Russian hands since the cold war. India cannot just stop buying Russian weaponry now when 70% of its army uses it. And let me remind you that India IS and HAS BEEN DIVERSIFYING away from Russian armament- not because of any ill-placed moral policing by Western armchair redditors- but because , again, doing so is better for its diversification .
Of course, India has been diversifying since then, because it's pragmatic and knows depending on a single country for national defence is not a great plan. France has always been a reliable partner in terms of defence because it doesn't dictate heavy-handed terms like the US does.
I don't think India has ever shown unreliable in its cooperations with France in the past. They're reputed to take some time to decide things, but to stick to what's agreed after contracts are signed.
