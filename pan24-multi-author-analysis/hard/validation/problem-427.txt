A Russian missile aimed at Ukraine was destroyed by Ukraine's air defense system. The debris went to hit Poland.
This should not obscure the fact that Russia is sending dozens, if not hundreds, of missiles every day into Ukraine targeting civilian populations to instill a sense of terror.
Irrelevant, if confirmed it would mean there was no attack on NATO member, not that article 5 would have been invoked even if it was Russian missile, people who say it should are either crazy or get aroused watching combat footage.
This time, it looks like it wasn't Russia so it's good that Article 5 wasn't invoked, but we've all been nervously watching the situation and wondering when it would turn into a full blown war. This missile strike could easily have been the spark that began a NATO-Russia war.
And Russia is the root cause of why those air defense missiles were shot off. Russia is to blame here, not Ukraine.
It’s propaganda to blame Ukraine. The blame solely rests on Russia, even if the missiles were Ukrainian. The missiles wouldn’t have been fired in defense if Russia weren’t invading a sovereign nation.
This is propaganda designed to turn people against Ukraine so that the US and UN can negotiate for Russia to end the war and steal part of Ukraine.
