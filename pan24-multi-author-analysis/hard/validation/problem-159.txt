That's just it. They absolutely, adamantly, refuse to do anything that might even hint at moderating any of their policies or planks. The ratchet can only go further to the right.
This has been part of the problem all along, because they've responded to electoral setbacks with anything BUT that, and everytime anyone suggests moderating to broaden the appeal, they get shouted down and more or less kicked out. (Seriously, go try it on r/conservative sometime. At least if you don't mind getting banned there, from what I hear.).
So no - Democrats clearly cheated somehow, or rigged things. It's the media's fault (liberal bias!) for bad coverage, not because the Republicans literally fielded awful extremist candidates. In this case they seem to be blaming Ranked Choice Voting, despite the fact that a lack of it would not have helped them - had Palin defeated Begich in a Republican primary, she'd still have lost to Peltola, because RCV literally was just a shortcut of that in this instance.
Probably not - the traditional Republican closed primary would have consolidated the party behind Palin… at which point all their energy would have focused on attacking Peltola instead of each other.
It’s interesting cycle though because Palin and Peltola seem to have genuine respect for each other from Palin’s time as Governor and they avoided direct attacks for the most part.
