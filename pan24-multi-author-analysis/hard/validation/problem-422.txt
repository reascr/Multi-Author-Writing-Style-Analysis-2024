Their entire political strategy since 2016 has relied on social media and their ability to influence voter sentiment.
There is not a single shred of good faith (or constitutional alignment) to the cries about free speech coming from Trump/Musk/MAGA.
On the right, "free speech" tends to mean freedom from speech, specifically any speech that contradicts conservative beliefs.
For example a conservative may declare that "Freedom of speech" means they get to drive gas cars and watch TV shows without gay characters and that's just how they define it. There is absolutely no coherent meaning behind that definition. All their words are just noise they make which they mutually understand as "feel good noise".
"Free speech" will mean whatever they want. It doesn't even need to make sense within the context of "free speech".
They say “free speech” but what they really mean is take away everyone else’s free speech rights. Everyone already has the right to free speech. You don’t have the right to say anything you want wherever you want though because all of the non-public places owned by others have a right to free speech too which includes what can and can’t be said on their property.
