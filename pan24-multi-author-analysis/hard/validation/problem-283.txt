They aren’t tho. It’s not like the government asks the people where the budget should go. Corruption leads to money flowing places that the people have little control over.
But it not like they all hate each other. It’s government policy. I’m no expert on the situation but to me it seems that for both sides conflict keeps them in power. On the Israeli side you have the far-right nationalists who feed on fear and on the other you have basically the same thing but with a bit of extremist Islam mixed in there.
I’m not saying either is right, I’m just saying Palestine increasingly looks less like they want a civil end to this, and are pushing further and further towards extremism. Can you genuinely say you think the Jews in Israel would be safe is Palestine was granted the entire territory? I’m just saying, Arabs under Israel are way better off then Jews would be under Palestine.
Absolutely false. The US did the Natives waaaaaaay worse than Israel could ever do with Palestinians. I’m sure the Palestinians could read the treaties fine, and there’s no basis to assume Israel wouldn’t keep to their treaty obligations.
The borders of Palestine and West Bank are globally recognized - with the exception of Juraselem by countries like Iran.
Israel believes it has a right to exist as an independent nation with peace and security as a primary goal. They also believe that they need living space similar to the Nazi concept of Lebensraum or the American concept of Manifest Destiny. The idea is that since they fought in wars and won these territories they eventually have the right to settle these areas and call them their own. The process of settling these areas safely has been slow and has required ever so slowly pushing the borders on Jerusalem and East Jerusalem and pushing into unoccupied territories of Palestine in the north. They believe this is all justified because these territories originally belonged to Egypt, Lebanon and Syria and they legally acquired these territories as reparations while fighting defensive wars against these nations.
