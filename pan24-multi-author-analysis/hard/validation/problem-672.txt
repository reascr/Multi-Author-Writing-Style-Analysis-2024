Counterintelligence. Countries do this all the time - allow some spies to come in and do their thing to both feed bad intelligence and see how it makes it's way back to the top brass of the enemy.
One was banging a literal Chinese spy and the other used his power as chairman on the intel committee to lie for political gain.
Just because the politician aligns with your political ideology doesnâ€™t mean they are honest people. Both sides lie for political gain. In this instance, one is not trustworthy and the other is a liar.
Now, flip the parties and substitute any republicans, then assign their actions to them and see if you would be asking the question above, or defending them. I would say no.
I don't agree. I think if Democrats chose Kevin as speaker some Republicans would not vote for him out of spite, shoulda just said on the floor "you want Kevin you got it".
Hakeem is a neo liberal corporate stooge. He talks pretty but he's been lock step with the centrist bigotry BS. Enough of these geezers and old guard moderate Republican Lite Democrats, they are the reason we are in this mess.
Lets vote real progressives and if the damn GOP continues to tank this country so be it...Enough already.
Come the fuck on Democrats It's time to be assholes, democracy is at risk with their bullshit. You can't have this guy pulling stunts without at least going through the motion of trying ONCE.
They should just spend the next 2 years trying to vote him out. There's not a legal limit on how many times they can try anyways.
