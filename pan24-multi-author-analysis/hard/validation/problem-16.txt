Those issues are months off, and if a crisis comes up that needs a semi-functioning House before that then the Democrats could just lend their votes to one side or the other and end this stalemate. That's the beauty of this situation; as long as the Republicans can't get together then the Democrats have full control over when it ends.
On the one hand—poetic justice for the anti-governing party that can’t even get their shit together long enough to form a governing coalition to elect a Speaker. On the other, there’s always the possibility McCarthy has to swear to do some batshit damaging stunt in order to secure the votes he needs, like defaulting on the debt or something.
While it is funny, once they eventually settle on a Speaker there’s a very good chance that the ultra right wing will be disproportionately powerful in controlling the agenda, House investigations, prime committee assignments, etc. and given their disinterest in the common good, this doesn’t bode particularly well for America.
