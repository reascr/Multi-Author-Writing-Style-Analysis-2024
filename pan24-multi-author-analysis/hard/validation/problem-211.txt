Interesting. So it might not be Elon's idea, but some underling who is either overzealous or else trying to deliberately sabotage things.

“UPDATE: The tweets by @TwitterSupport this morning, announcing a new policy banning linking to competing websites, have been deleted.
Twitter prohibited accounts that solely promote links on other platforms. So if you had an account that, for example, only tweeted links to trump’s truths or whatever as his posted them, that would be banned.
I will admit that, as I said, I have never actually used Twitter, only seen the tweets that are reposted everywhere.
I like reddit because I like my feed only lightly curated but also full of diverse people. (Insert "lol, reddit is nothing but this or that kind of people" here.).
I'm not gonna argue that I'm somehow "right" for my thoughts on it, and the people like you who found value in it are "wrong." Just sharing my perspective that I think everything it does could be done better, and that it has also been a profound negative on the world, and the net gain/loss is debatable. The same could be said about reddit, but here I am, so I don't necessarily have a leg to stand on.
