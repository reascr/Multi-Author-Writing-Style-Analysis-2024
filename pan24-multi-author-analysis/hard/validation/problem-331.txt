This is like a remote town with nothing in it. I didn’t realize how far Ukraine has pushed back until I looked this up on a map. Wow. Good job Russia. That’s the first win for Russia I’ve heard in a long time, and it’s a sad win.
Its also pretty sad how even with western support the Russians are still in Ukraine and taking ground.
Nearly no progress has been made in 2 months now, a lot of people on this site vastly underestimate how many men Putin can throw at this and hold on. The longer this goes on the more financial pain at home there will be which will only lower support in the future, we need to get this over with as quickly as possible before people stop caring.
I dont believe we even have the purely defensive patriot AA system sent yet, its an embarrasment on how much we're dragging our feet. The tanks we're sending are being sent in the 10's, we should be sending them in the 100's. The longer this drags out the more Ukrainian lives will be lost.
Soledar is to the north of Bakhmut so it’s a massive loss for the Ukrainians fighting in the stronghold. Supplies from the north are all but cut off now, and the Russians are one step closer to encircling the city.
