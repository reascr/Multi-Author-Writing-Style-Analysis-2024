Regardless of the occasion I feel like anyone flying a Russian flag at the moment can fuck off. Flying a Russian flag can only mean one thing right now, and that is war support.
There are athletes competing in esports that choose to not be represented by the russian flag due to their stance against the war so u know, they could do that.
The Russian people do need to feel consequences and having no sports would be something that’s not actually something that effects their lives but remind how their country has been shamed on world stage. Instead for being able to live in a bubble where Russian athletes get treated the same on world stage. Also they Russian athletes commonly use doping anyway, so not a loss from the sports perspective.
Majority of nations would not have voted to condemn USA (and plenty were it’s allies), Russia literally has been condemned by most countries in UN. I would not have an issue with countries condemned by majority of UN causing restrictions for its athletes anyway, and if same had happened for US why would that have been bad in your view anyway? The athletes are there to represent the country. If they really need careers in sports they can move elsewhere and get another citizenship. That would solve the unfairness on a individual level.
