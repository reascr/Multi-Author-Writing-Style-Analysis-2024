If he replies then Putin is running around trying to show that he is alive and his actions are being manipulated by Zelensky.
I hope he is alive and stays alive because if something happens to Putin there is a chance that Medveded might take control and he is worse than Putin.
Putin is scared as fuck to go public, becase of the current situation, if he is still alive. Btw he was an entitled coward for like 15 years at least, when it became clear that his politics is shit and majority of population despise him.
And this theory that Putin is dead already existed for like 12 years ago, because nobody from mortals ever seen him in person for the entirety of his reign.
If you check out, he has the same background actors in every public appearance for like a decade. He never appears public for the past 15 years, it always some distinguish appearance behind bulletproof glass, steel wall in the tank inside the tank, inside the submarine inside the airplane through video on the photos shit and actually somewhere safe, in France or Germany for example, lul.
