I also want to chime in that in my experience, many of these people can't recognize that people might think differently than them for any good reasons.
Similarly, an old coworker of mine thinks Leftists and Dems are part of an insidious cabal or have secret intentions because, to paraphrase, "no one believes or wants that hippy dippy commie shit, and if they do then they're brainwashed.".
So much this. Really saw that demonstrated when COVID hit. People thought that if they didn't "believe in COVID" then it wouldn't hurt them or something. I just don't understand people like that.
They can’t understand that a man (or a woman) can be so many other things and it does not affect them one bit. Gay men can be masc or femme, they can be drag queens or jocks or anything in between. Trans people existing does not affect a cis person at all. But they’re so hopelessly attached to these old binaries and changing that scares them so much, even when it has nothing to do with them.
They’re also deeply fearful people. My brother is one of these fascists and was very anti-mask/anti-vax. He would keep telling me that my boyfriend and I need to stop living in fear. My boyfriend literally works with infectious diseases and primarily works on treatments/cures for many of them. All of that experience was lost on my brother and he interpreted basic precautions we took in 2020/2021 for fear. It took too long for me to realize that he was the one afraid and the masks and vaccines were reminders that there was a global pandemic and that was too scary for him. They can’t accept that no one is truly in control because that chaos frightens them. So they turn to strongmen and authoritarians who claim they can fix it. They cannot understand that others do not live their lives in constant fear. Fascists are some of the weakest and most fearful people I’ve ever met.
