'Hey dudes we need those Leopards back, we've asked America and they've agreed to backfill any holes you have with Abrams. We can promise you a next gen replacement deal in exchange for buying the tanks back from America once the new tanks are dlivered'.
America has promised Abrams to European countries to replace their tank stocks. Make a bilateral agreement between the countries with the 2a4's, america, and germany. America gives them tank replacements, they send their tanks back, germany promises to pay america for them, germany sells their new tank to said european countries for a discount when it is produced.
Also in what world 230 reimbursement of 230 soviet tanks gets you like 200 Abrams (don't remember how much Poland is buying)?
You would have to first convince these countries to give them up after they just send their old soviet tanks to Ukraine.
Ukrainians have already stated that they need thousands of tanks, though I hope the tanks + APCs and other defense/offensive weapons are able to do the job.
