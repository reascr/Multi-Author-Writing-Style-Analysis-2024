Democrats are baby-killing, anarchist, transgender grooming antifa scum. Listen to talk radio for the 4 minutes between advertising and you'll think progressives are Satan incarnate. But also, many many Republicans are single issue voters on guns and abortion.
I forgot to mention that there's a healthy portion of true nutter-butters. My churchy/religion-obsessed grandmother told me in 2008 that Obama was, in fact, the antichrist (I knew then that her brain was a marshmallow). My fox News loving coworker insisted recently that, "we'll never know" the results of the 2020 or future presidential elections. So don't forget that some people are just hopelessly stupid.
Imagine being such a vile, selfish sack of shit that you'd want to decimate the overall economy and cause others to suffer a miserable existence so you can be incrementally more rich. That's the very nature of a wealthy republican voter.
That in no way matches how Republicans rule. They increase spending and reward those who are already rich. They keep hard working folk in low paying jobs in favor of CEOs.
