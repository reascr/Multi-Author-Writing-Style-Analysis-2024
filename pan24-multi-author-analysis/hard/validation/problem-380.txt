I mean, he has a point. Georgia doesn’t have a system that allows someone with just a plurality to win.
You can’t just people who want to run outside the two party system to fuck off because it ruins you idea of how you want your candidate to win. The election process should empower different views, not restrict them to a duopoly.
Right now a third party candidate's only purpose is to hand the election to the candidate who they are most dissimilar from. First past the post ensures that. Talking about how things 'should' be doesn't change the reality.
And if they do lose hard enough and for long enough, it might convince them that they need to start representing the actual will of the people and governing instead of just screaming about identity politics, trying to subvert our elections, and racing each other to see who can be the most despicable. Continually show the republicans that the US rejects the lunatics who run the party right now, and eventually they'll drop them.
Voting third party literally does nothing in the US, other than giving the party that least represents you a better shot at winning.
You want to get rid of first past the post? Great. That's a good goal. But first, let's ensure that democracy itself survives. It would be great if we had more than 2 serious political parties in this country, but right now we only have 1. Vote for democrats at every level. Give them strong majorities and lobby at the state level for ranked choice voting. You will never get that from republicans. Never. Democrats are the only choice.
If you're more liberal than the current Democrats you should vote for democrats and lobby them to enact progressive policies. As those policies take effect and work, push for candidates who more closely align to your values. And push for ranked choice voting.
