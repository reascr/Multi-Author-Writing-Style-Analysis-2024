Eh, a lot of people hate the economy under Biden. It's just that the alternative is an insane party that only stands for Owning The Libs by making things miserable for people.
The supply chain stuff is obviously because of the pandemic (and Trump's response to it), but the infrastructure bill definitely contributed to inflation.
The infrastructure bill does not explain why the entire world is experiencing historic inflation. With or without the infrastructure bill there would be history inflation as evidenced by other countries that had no such government spending bills passed. The only way to prevent the inflation we are seeing today is to have had a better government in the past and have more regulations on corporate greed.
Not perfect of course. But he is restoring credibility to the executive branch after 4 years of utter misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance from top to bottom during the Trump years. More work is still needed as the damage Trump did to this country will take more than 4 years to undo.
We did not need tax cuts during a raging economy. We did not need to bungle a global pandemic. We did not need to wage a tariff war with China. But we cannot change the past. The infrastructure bill was a necessary evil to invest in the future for the country. That was not something republicans would have ever done and their handling of actual economic and health crisis is proven to end in tragedy over and over.
