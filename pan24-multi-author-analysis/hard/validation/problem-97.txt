I believe that making certain guns/equipment illegal it makes crimes associated with those guns/equipment harder to perform - thus reducing said crime.
Isn't the argument for banning things like extended magazines and bump stocks to make mitigate rates of fire and potential damage/harm from the misuse of such weapons - not that they are "scary looking"?
Now that's obviously an extreme example, but the point is that everyone has a "destructiveness" line for weapons, at which they agree individuals should be barred from possessing those weapons, whether they've thought about it or not. My line may a lot lower than a lot of people's, but that doesn't mean it's inherently invalid, just unpopular. There's obviously lots of room for debate on where exactly that line stands (full-auto? Artillery? How about "arms" used in cyber warfare, like viruses? Chemical weapons?) but as we clearly agree, you can easily lose the forest for the trees by fixating on this one particular disagreement, and that's been heavily encouraged to avoid real movement on positive change.
Someone with a more conspiratorial mindset might say "And that's exactly how the ruling class wants it".

You are choosing to sell your labor to them at a mutually agreed upon rate. Nobody is forcing you to work there. They are not "stealing' shit....everything you described is a voluntary exchange.
