I think a very visible international trial for war crimes would do the rest of the world quite a bit of good. Shooting her in the face might be fair justice, surely, but a protracted show of international condemnation would be so much better for everyone (except Russia, of course, but they'll bitch and whine and lie like they always do anyways so who cares?).
Yep. Sometimes the best posture is defence. Ukraine has depleted a huge amount of Russia’s best troops and equipment. They aren’t coming back.
Russia: stupid Westoid Russia is taking Soledar and there is nothing your propaganda can do to stop it.
Russian dude: So Russia has taken Soledar See, you Westoids are crying in your propaganda Russia is going to go and take Bakmut now!
Watch the pro Russian propaganda posts flood in now "its all part of the plan, Russia doesn't care about losses".
Yeah, despite Russia's propaganda to the contrary, a good chunk of the world had a very strong suspicion regarding Russia's intentions by that point. And, given his connections with western society, it would require no special insight to surmise that his holdings would be the target of sanctions. The main item I would imagine Abramovich had inside knowledge regarding was the poor state of Russia's military due to rampant corruption and this the fact that they would fall on their face in the first three days instead of performing the swift decapitation Putin intended.
