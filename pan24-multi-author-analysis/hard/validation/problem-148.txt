It’s really not that big of a deal. Nerva was found to be the most efficient and reliant engine. It had a high ISP and only needed a hydrogen mono propellant to be used. And it had the benefit of constantly giving electrical energy.
That’s not at all a problem. And one thing, nerva isn’t a nuclear reactor it uses a small amount of fissile material to heat up liquid hydrogen into heated gas. And the small amount isn’t even much of an issue if it explodes because it’s so small it wouldn’t cause much fallout. All your thinking about is a bunch of anti nuclear propaganda pushed by coal and oil companies to keep peddling their shitty products.
And in what way do we need to cart about fallout in space? The engine thrust isn’t enough to lift anything off the ground, it would be reserved for space activities only.
Those worries where from when Nerva was fist conceived in the 60’s. We’ve reached the point in our control of nuclear substances that the chances of problems arising are almost nonexistent. Modern reactors are so safe a literal child could use them without blowing it up.
I mean, the reactors would never blow up, they’d melt down and spread radiation over a wide area, but that’s a moot point.
The risky part is getting the reactors safely into space, or at least far enough away to not cause widespread fallout from an exploded rocket.
Before the average person reads this and freaks out, nuclear rockets are ONLY used in space (which is already filled with deadly radiation). They are not used to launch rockets inside the Earth’s atmosphere.
