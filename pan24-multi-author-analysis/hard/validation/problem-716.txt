Same as Poland then. Poland will send their 30-40 year old 2A4s instead of their modernized ones tho (the german ones are 2A6s, which is the version build in the 2000s).
If we actually end up sending 2A5s and up versions (and not just older 2A4s) in decent quantities then Russians will have all the reasons to be worried. These things are SCARY. Not just "a bit scary" either - Leopards have benchmarked best of all tanks by a significant margin.
If you want to get the best tanks that are available, you either buy the American M1 or the German Leopard 2. How good they are now exactly depends on the exact versions but they are generally the best of the best of a certain age bracket of tanks.
With a few nations sending stuff, Ukraine is getting 30 M1s and around 45-50 Leopard 2s or so. Some of those are the older Leopard 2A4 standard, which was up to date in the late 80s and some are the newer A6 standard from the late 90s/early 2000s.
Leopard 2A7A1 is the variant with the Trophy system. There are not enough of them to send as any upgrades to thst version at scale still lies a bit into the future.
The Leopard 2 was however, specifically designed to trump Russian tanks and to fight in European Geography...
Leopard 2A6, High end Abrams, Leclercs, Challengers and I guess K2 and possibly Japanese tanks are all roughly equivalent. They share a lot of tech and know-how, but do different trade-offs.
