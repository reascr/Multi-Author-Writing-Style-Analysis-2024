Everything in Canada is either a monopoly or an oligopoly. We're apparently allergic to competition. That's why we have the highest internet and cell phone bills in the world.
Phone and Internet costs when I lived I Canada were absurd. Like $50+ for 2-4 GB (which by the looks of it has at least go d up to 20-30).
Good to see from their other psot that data coverages are gone though. I once binged some Netflix and youtube sick in bed, had the WiFi connected but forgot to turn mobile data off so it went for that because reasons I guess, and wound up getting charged about $80 extra on the back of that alone.
Even the same tub of liberte Yoghurt made and packaged in quebec, after being transported across an entire ocean, costs considerably less here than over there.
And charging more for higher fat milk was just hilarious on so many levels. It stopped getting funny when a 500g tub of feta was like $12 and a pint of double cream something like $9 (rough figures admittedly, going in memory here).
