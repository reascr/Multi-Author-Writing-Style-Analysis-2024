The very well paid software dev money in the UK is in Finance, especially as a Freelancer (aka a Contractor) or even better a Quant (though that is more Maths than software dev and requires a hard science or Mathematics Degree or better).
However the path to that in the UK is near non-existent - how are young people entering the profession supposed to make their career up to the more senior levels were the good pay is, when the junior and mid-level work is either outsourced to places like India or doesn't pay enough to afford a place to live near were the work is?!
That’s where I’ve been looking! I work in health care, and the NHS seems better there. The recent nursing pay situation kind of has me reconsidering but we will see how it goes.
Crazy because I’m in the US and looking to move to the UK. My salary would be about half but the chances of armed revolution are pretty low in the UK.
Chances of an armed revolution in the US is pretty low too. Most people just want to go to work and go home.
