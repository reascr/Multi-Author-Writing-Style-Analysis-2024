Permitless carry or "constitutional carry" normally means concealed, but can apply to open also depending on the state.
I only skimmed the article but does permitless carry mean concealed carry? Or are they saying that open carry is now allowed in nearly half the states?
A big trend over the last 5 years or so is for more states to become "constitutional carry" states. Basically, as long as you can legally own a gun, you can carry that gun.
Carrying a gun may be legal, but menacing is not. Anyone who is doing literally anything with a firearm that is not secured in the slightest will have to speak to the police.
Having less guns on the street by making it more difficult for law abiding citizens to carry is not the fix you think it is.
Our laws suppress rights by simply trying to limit the amount of guns in public in the name of public safety while not addressing the causes of violence in the first place. They certainly aren't successful at discouraging criminals who somehow got a gun and carries it regardless.
