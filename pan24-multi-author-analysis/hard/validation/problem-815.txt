but on this one? this is disgraceful. these 20 are halting the business of the government so that they can try to force things to be passed that republicans were unable to pass when they had larger majorities and the senate (things like term limitations and a balanced budget act.) if they could not get them when they had large majorities, how are they supposed to get them now when they have essentially no majority in 1 part of 1 of the 3 branches?
gaetz, beobert, et al are a disgrace. they are turning the republican party into a national embarrassment. they are trying to justify this by playing to a tiny part of their base.
these 20 are destroying the republican party and assuring that NONE of the things that voters sent to washinon to be leaders to do are going to be done.
I had low expectations for Republicans taking the House, but even my cynical ass is amazed at how bad they are screwing things up already. Hearing that scumbag Gaetz nominate Trump for Speaker of the House was a surreal moment.
