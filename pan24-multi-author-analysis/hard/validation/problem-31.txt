Read some news, Germany has said multiple times they have not received any request from Poland or any other country for that matter for export licenses for their leopards so your statement just has nothing to do with reality.
As I stated above Germany/Scholz have stated multiple times that the only way the will send tanks to Ukraine is if other countries do so first.
"The number of tanks [to be sent to Ukraine] cannot be large, since Finland borders on Russia and is not part of NATO.”.
Russia invading Finland with cross the line and the US would just send them billions upon billions of dollars worth of cutting edge weapons. Don’t forget that the Russians have largely exhausted their supply of tanks made before 1970.
Tanks seem like a liability because the Russians abandon their own tank doctrine in favor of acting like idiots. We’ve known since World War I that a tank on its own is an easy target, tanks supported by infantry and air can be useful. Russian military instead sends tanks out with no dismounted infantry and often without air. If you don’t have boots on the ground along with the tanks there’s little to no threat to enemy infantry armed with antitank weapons by javelins and rocket propelled grenades. Yes tanks have lost some utility due to the use of inexpensive antitank weapons and drones. But Russian military doctor and it is extra stupid so we’re not learning that much.
