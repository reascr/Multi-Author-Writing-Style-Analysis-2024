Hospice isn't in-home care. It's always been intended to be an additional layer of support and information for patients and families while they continue whatever caregiving they would have without hospice.
Ah, so this is a hospice/home health combo company or something? It's not quite fair to disparage hospice in general for things not covered as part of hospice care. This particular company offers additional paid "add-ons" that don't meet your specifications, but that's not really part of what "hospice" is.
People can also revoke hospice and leave at any time, so if there is something available they want to pursue, it's just one signature on a form and you're back on whatever insurance plan you had before and you can go for it.
I've made it clear to everyone in my family (in writing) that my desire is to take advantage of the state's assisted suicide the day that I am no longer able to live in my own home. Also going with the green burial or cremation for my remains, whichever is cheaper.
