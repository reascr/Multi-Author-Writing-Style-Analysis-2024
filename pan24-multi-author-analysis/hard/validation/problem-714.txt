He set the withdrawal up to fail and then his entire administration actively refused to fully participate in the presidential transition of power.
Ended what mess? He locked the Afghanistan government out of the withdrawal talks with the Taliban, let Taliban prisoners out, and then withdrew all but a relative handful of US forces.
Trump's main point in his surrender with the Taliban was that he would be removing troops. Not bringing more in. Biden would have been in breach of the agreement if he brought in any additional troops to assist with the exit of the country.
Trump agreed to release 5,000 prisoners/terrorists, agreed to leave the country, agreed to not attack the Taliban, agreed to not do anything about the Taliban taking over the country, and agreed to make this deal without the Afghan government we had put in power.
And negotiated with the Taliban without including the actual Afghan government and released 5000 Taliban fighters as part of the deal. It's not like he did everything he could to fuck it up and commit the next administration to a timeline that wasn't wise or favorable.
