I have learned, in the past few years, that ignorance isn’t a defense for low level offenders. There are tons of laws where the prosecution needs to demonstrate intent.
And Law means nothing if it’s not enforced. You can make all the “rules” and “laws” you want, but if nobody enforces them… you might as well not have them.
I think there should be enforceable ethics laws, but it's hard to think of a good way to implement and enforce them.
I'm not sure if there is a legal mechanism to create a binding code of ethics for the Supreme Court. If it isn't airtight, the Supreme Court could even rule instituting a code is unconstitutional. At that point, I believe impeachment of justices would be the only legal remedy, and removal would require a majority of the House and super majority in the Senate. That is not going to happen.
Even if the code isn't declared unconstitutional, I think the only enforcement mechanism for the code would be impeachment, or potentially the Supreme Court itself.
And if they breach those rules, they will have to explain themselves to the Supreme Court And if they dispute those rules, they’ll have to convince the Supreme Court the rules are unconstitutional.
