So by me choosing not to align as a Democrat then I must be a Republican? What kind of ass backward logic is that? I am a moderate and I'll vote for whichever candidate reflects my values most. Sometimes that is a Democrat and sometimes that is a Republican.
I would agree that the only right choice at the state and national level are Democrats. Local politicians I had two Republicans I backed for council positions.
Don't even look at it tonight. It'll look like the GOP ran away with it but early and mail in votes won't be counted until after midnight so the numbers will be massively skewed before those actually get counted.
Read the article- Mailed-in ballots take longer to count, donâ€™t always arrive at election offices before Election Day, and often are put at the back of the line.
Common sense would say that early voting and mail in ends before election day, giving straggler ballots a few days to trickle in. Election day then becomes your last chance.
Early voting ends before election day. All mail in ballots should need to be posted/post marked by that same day. There's then time for mail in ballots to trickle in before election day. Election day becomes everyone's last chance. There's no logical reason for all the stupid problems we seem to have in the USA. We need and should be allowed to expect a functional system.
