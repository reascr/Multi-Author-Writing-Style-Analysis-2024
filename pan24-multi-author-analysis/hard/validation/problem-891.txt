Looks like the liberal readers here do not like it when one of their own media outlets posts some facts that do not lean their way. Truth is fair so if someone is outright fibbing to the public, it should be noted. Too bad Fox News would never do the same to one of their own, however, since they tend to exaggerate and even originate some odd claims.
In contrast here, for most of Trump's presidency I made an effort to give benefit of the doubt when I saw headlines saying he said something misleading, false, or otherwise just awful. I'd go in reading those articles looking for ways Trump was getting an uncharitable assessment. But, far more often than not, when I read or watched the things Trump actually said, the headlines were actually giving Trump more credit than he deserved. The crap that came out of Trump's mouth was regularly even worse than the headlines I tried to take with a grain of salt.
In that context, CNN's descent into a hard right turn under the guise of balance is even more wretched.
