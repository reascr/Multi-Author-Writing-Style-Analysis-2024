That's just the beginning ... it's important to report anything that references the Bible and its religious teachings. That means anyone who wears a cross is on the list. Or anyone who goes to a church because many Christian denominations have been repeatedly exposed as havens and providing protections for pedophile priests and ministers. And it's going to kind of suck for any town with a name like "Saint" or any community that exists in a "parish" (instead of a "county," which is the proper term used in the United States . ).

oh, come on now. Just because you have a bunch of scantily clad children prance around in front of guys doesn't mean you are sexualizing them. /s.
Funny they made an issue on Netflix sexualizing cheerleaders, but they never addressed real cheerleaders in school being sexualized.
Maybe it's time to make Lolita required reading. I hear we love Russians now. But Dostoevsky by be too intellectual for the GOP.
