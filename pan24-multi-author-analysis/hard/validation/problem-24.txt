I've tried my best, but when you live in a county that votes 75% red, it's kind of hard to feel like you can do anything to affect change at the local and state level.
Voting in republican primaries seems like the best chance people have to affect things when they're in a red enough area. There's zero chance any democrat will win in Indiana, so I'm going to vote in the republican primaries to try to keep the worst of the worst out of the general.
They won't do that if the only other viable candidate I'd Democrat. We need to start voting for a person instead of a party. There are many other political parties, some of which favor deconstructing big government. That seems attractive to me these days.
I don't see it that way at all. I think there's too much micromanaging from our government. Lobbying and campaign commercials should be a thing of the past. No more career politicians. We should be voting people into office who care about more than a career in that field. I hope that would help bring common sense back into governing. In fact, we should get rid of the party system altogether and come up with a different way to put checks and balances into place. It's so broken now, I don't see a way to fix it.
