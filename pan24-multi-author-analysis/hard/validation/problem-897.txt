Almost certainly not true. Even if the engines had failed (which the video evidence does not strongly support), the pilot can maintain control and land, even if it's short of the airfield. This is a far better outcome than a stall/spin, which the video does strongly support. The aircraft is shown in an extreme nose-high attitude prior to spinning in, which is strongly indicative of a stall. Stall/spins are rarely survivable, whereas a controlled off-field landing often is, depending on terrain. Yes, I am a pilot.
I am a pilot, and a former instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School. I taught folks how to test airplanes to evaluate engine-out performance.
The short snippet of video I saw of the airplane before the crash looked like either the left wing was dropping precipitously or the pilots were banking hard to the left. If both props were feathered (hence, no thrust from the engines) and a tight turn was initiated, it would be very easy to stall the plane since that would likely not be a configuration the pilots had ever experienced before. And at low altitude, a non wings level stall could very easily cause the airplane to roll nearly inverted and hit the ground since there’s no altitude to recover.
While I'm not disagreeing that they had an engine problem, the plane seemed to have a higher angle of attack than you would typically expect for a pilot trying to glide in for a landing.
OTOH if you’re low, not used to engine-out approaches, and/or not familiar with the glide characteristics of the aircraft, you can easily tend towards a nose-up attitude, which can quickly lead to a stall/spin.
