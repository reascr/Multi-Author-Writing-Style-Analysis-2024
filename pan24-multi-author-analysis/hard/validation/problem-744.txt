Step 6: Blue states, now comprising Blue USA, suddenly have extra money since they don't need to support red states. They also have less pushback against liberal policies like expanding healthcare access. Advances come smoother in Blue USA.
Step 7: Texas (one of the few red states that gives more in taxes than it gets) is sick of supporting the red states and so secedes again, forming The Republic of Texas.
Step 5: The red states break off into Red USA. (I'm sure they'd have a better name like "New Confederacy" or "The Non-Woke States of America," but I'll just refer to them as Red USA.).
