Did a switch flip? Amazing how overnight, Republicans and conservative forums everywhere are suddenly lamenting, seemingly in unison, that Trump “is only in it for himself”, he’s going to “divide the country” to “satisfy his ego”, and it’s “time to abandon Trump”.
When someone tries to argue that the Republican Party is not in thrall to Trump, that he doesn’t represent the majority of Republicans, all you have to look at to know they’re wrong - not necessarily lying, but deluded - is the above.
Remember, Senate Republicans - the topmost leaders in the Republican Party - had two chances to convict Trump and bar him from office after the House impeached him twice. If even a small minority of Senate Republicans agreed to convict on either impeachment offense would have seen him barred from future office. Had they done so, they would not have to deal with Trump and the possibility of him running again.
If Trump announces his 2024 presidential run, then it is on. If he doesn't announce, then he likely caved to outside pressure and I don't see that happening after the last 6 years.
