Being allowed to show up Trump and get away with it, is going to encourage all the rest of them to lie outrageously. Oh, what am I saying? They all lie outrageously.
At this point, him telling the truth should make the news because his incessant lying seems to be the norm.
At this point you could make a headline up about this guy, and I’d have no choice but to believe it because of the everything else he’s already lied about.
What I’ve seen is “we believe in ‘innocent until proven guilty’.” So even the stuff he’s admitted he lied about, as far as the House GOP is concerned, is not a lie until he’s been convicted of it. This is how low their bar is these days. I mean, there are multiple members of their caucus under criminal investigation as we speak. That the party of law and order, the party of personal responsibility, the party of the adults in the room would pretend this is OK says a whole lot about how hollow their franchise is.
Of course, once people like Sarah Palin and Trump showed the path, it became clear to the broader public that most Republican voters really only care that you say what they’re all thinking, they don’t care at all about your character or even basic facts about your identity.
Seriously, I’d be patting myself on the back so hard if I managed to win a seat in Congress on a bet, with the lone stipulation being that 95% of my candidacy had to be a lie. That’s a tremendously successful grift.
