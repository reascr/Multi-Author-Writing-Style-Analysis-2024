I live on a dirt road so unfortunately… not a chance. They grate the roads and spray them with a sodium mixture. I’m pretty convinced that it’s a state wide conspiracy to make us all have to buy cars all of the time given our auto industry here.
Michigander here. We have the best hill in our front yard for sledding and the kids have used it one time this year. It’s raining outside right now. I miss the snowy weather.
I live a bit more south in the Midwest and we've had maybe two snowfalls all year? Aside from one bad cold snap, this just has to be a record for the warmest winter we've ever had. It's rained far more than it's snowed. Seems like the temperatures average in the high 30s, maybe low 40s. We've had several days in the mid and high 40s and even high up in the 50s. Usually the temperature here would rarely reach the high 30s.
No one is going to do anything if you just say winters are getting warmer. If you want people to actually do something, you gotta focus on the negative, heatwave, drought, flooding etc.
