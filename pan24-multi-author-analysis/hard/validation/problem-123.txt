Actually in the mid 1980s rents went down after controls were out in place and home ownership was actually affordable.
I just don’t see it happening this time. There’s too much he’s said that makes him unelectable in the general honestly.
What I do know is many (R) I’ve talked to in my very red state say that he needs to stop talking and pass the torch (instead of burning it down.).
Here's the thing. Nobody wanted him for the 2016 campaign, either. He got the nomination because, while the majority did not want him, they couldn't decide on who else they wanted. There were something like 9 candidates at the start. 75% of them didn't want Trump, but they split that 75% between the other 8 candidates and Trump kept "winning" because 25% would beat the 10% everyone else was getting because the votes were split between so many people.
Same thing can happen in the next election. That 25% of MAGA die-hards will stick with him and unless everyone else can pick a candidate very early on, he'll keep winning primaries. And the one thing Republicans do well is fall into line when someone looks like they are going to be the pick. Most of those "never Trump" people right now will vote for him if he looks like he's going to be the nominee because all they care about is that the candidate has an "R" next to his name at the end of the day.
