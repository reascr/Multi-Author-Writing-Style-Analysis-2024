Maybe a better option would be to use western intelligence capabilities to sneak a few thousand automatic rifles through the border into Iran so that protesters would have something to push back government forces, instead of stating the obvious by lighting up a useless tower on another continent?
Maybe even shoot a long range missile into Ayotallah's mansion while that shithead is snoring, because they don’t have a nuclear weapon to retaliate, for now, and do the same with other high profile figures of the regime, it’s not like the most of their civilians aren’t supporting a regime change.
Yes let’s risk another international conflict, because it’d be so easy to sneak weapons across the Iranian-controlled Iranian border just like that to arm untrained civilians and make sure they don’t provoke the government either further and have them actually mowed down en-masse now.
Giving the Iranian protesters guns is basically impossible since no one knows who the hell the protesters are and there's no organization to give guns to, while Ukraine has a whole state structure to recieve Western weapons and train their battle-harden troops to use the weapons.
More fundementally, Ukraine is a nation-state with soliders, the Iranian protesters aren't even a solid group or organization but rather large unorganized public reactions to police burtality and sexism from the Islamic Regime.
