God forbid developing nations learn from advanced countries on how to develop while being cleaner and not destroying the earth.
It's no longer the 1980's , China produces everything for the entire world. Per Capita isn't a great excuse for the giant factories in china that produce more pollution than entire nations.
Blaming capitalism for the problem, when the largest source of climate change causing pollutants is a communist country makes no sense.
I just watched a documentary last night which stated that China is the largest contributor to carbon emissions that cause climate change. They have a communist government.
If you want to indulge the [far] leftist theoreticians, no country achieved communism. Even the former Soviet bloc countries only declared themselves socialist and on the path to communism, but not entirely having completed it. So it's hard to say what something that never existed might be like. Of course, the theoreticians who praised this ideal communism probably would not accept that it has to be authoritarian, despite the "dictatorship of the proletariat" as a critical transitional phase. As the joke/saying goes, temporary things have a way of becoming permanent.
Edit: for anyone here who actually wishes to learn about non-authoritarian communism, here is a great exerpt on anti-Stalinism from Marcuse:
It depends on what you mean by communism. If you mean what the Soviet-bloc states ended up like, then, yes, all historical examples of this communism were pretty authoritarian.
Now regarding China nowadays, it's even further away from Soviet (or Maoist) style socialism, let alone ideal communism. Some have compared China to fascism or at least state capitalism, the justification for either being rather tricky on a pure Marxist basis.
