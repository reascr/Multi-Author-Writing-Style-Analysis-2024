Congressmen and Senators should be definitely banned from trading stocks, and the ban should be taken a step further and prohibit any family members from trading in stocks related to the committees of the members they're related too.
I'm not defending it because I do think they should be banned from trading individual stocks (index funds I'm fine with and blind trusts should be mandatory), but so it's not like they're doing any of their stock investing in secret, it's quite easy to see what legislation is being debated and is going to come up for a vote, often months to years in advance of it happening. I also think the reason Congress tends to do better in the market then the average "investor" is the average investor isn't as clued into current economic trends, Congress has to be as it's part of their job. So it's not like most congresspeople are doing anything that is nefarious because it's all out in the open, more so than everyone else simply because they have more strict individual reporting requirements (well, not as strict as actual financial institutions).
That said, it's important to separate actual crimes of insider trading (which are already investigated by the SEC and FBI) and violations of the STOCK Act (which is mostly just a reporting law requiring more frequent disclosure of investments). In the case of STOCK Act violations I think they need to drastically increase the punishment, which right now is only a few hundred dollars, to instead be a sizable % of the amount they invested but didn't report on time.
It won't now because the GOP is in the majority. While a few Democrats opposed it in the last session to the point it couldn't be brought to the floor for a vote, all Republicans opposed it, any calls from the GOP now about it are disingenuous.
