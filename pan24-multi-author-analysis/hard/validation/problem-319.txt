Because heâ€™s not actually serious about term limits. The bill is posturing for votes. He knows the GOP base is too stupid to understand the contradiction, and he also knows the bill itself has zero chance of passing.
I do think he might even be intentionally weaponizing the fact that he's universally loathed to forward term limits, because it tends to be Republicans who want them.
You don't play by the rules of the system you wish we had, you play by the ones we've got right now. Ironically Cruz is probably generating a lot of support for term limits by running again.
For term limits, it really depends on why Cruz supports them to decide if this is simply rank hypocrisy. Does he feel that nobody should serve long as a matter of principle? Or does he believe that long serving senators are more beholden to powerful interests, and the system would be improved by imposing term limits, but not by individual senators choosing to retire?
Not OP, but I'm afraid term limits would lead to more people getting themselves elected in order to do corporate bidding and get rewarded with a cushy job after their time in the Senate is up. I mean, even more than they do now.
Oh, he also said he, Franken, liked Ted Cruz more than anyone else in the Senate liked Ted Cruz, and he fucking hated Ted Cruz.
I also suspect no one really knows what they are doing when they first begin, and term limits might get rid of them at the exact point a Congressperson hits their stride and learns to get shit done. Especially for Reps, with their 2-year terms.
