this is a situation where the libs actually need to be owned though and letting congresspeople to continue to use “democracy” as a casino to “own the republicans” is much worse, actually.
Besides, democrats are not as petty as the republicans and actually have some ideological scruples— so a bill introduced by republicans is much more likely to pass anyway.
The republicans can actually be trusted to support a bill sponsored by a republican, and the democrats will look at the bill on its merits. Several of them may be willing eschew party lines and vote with the republicans, so really it made sense to table it until this session. Let the republicans waste their legislative time bickering over the details of it— they ought to do some of the work for once.
I know timing is the important factor here, but it's still bullshit and hypocrisy from Republicans to single out Pelosi.
1. The 5 congress people who made the most profit trading stocks were all republican. This info is for 2021.
I'm not in a position currently to do a bunch of research.  But I did look into it a while back because there are people tracking these things and found that...
2. Pelosi's trades were mostly very basic.  Microsoft. Apple.  Google.  She and her husband weren't trading companies you've never heard of before.  They were trading stocks that any amateur could tell were good.
