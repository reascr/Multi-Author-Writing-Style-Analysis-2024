They won because redistricting was made non-partisan by voters in 2018. Before this year, a majority of Michiganders voted for Democrats to represent them, while Republicans won the majority of seats due to gerrymandering.
State is 36% Dem, 30% Rep and we now have a GOP super majority state senate, majority Rep state house, and most frighteningly a majority Rep state supreme court (that has been Dem a long time and prevented a lot of GOP BS). All due to atrocious gerrymandering.
The senate race was based on popular vote and the results were 50% vs. 47%. Yet our state legislature "somehow" (that was sarcasm, I actually mean it's gerrymandered) ended up with GOP majority house and super majority senate.
Governor is Dem still at least but like when the GOP Governor lost to him, I'm sure our GOP majority will strip him of his power with no State Supreme Court to be reasonable.
Districting is done by an independent commission, which is almost certainly the reason why Dems were able to flip the state legislature.
Turns out things are possible when majorities of the voters are for you and you're NOT fighting with both hands bound behind your back.
We just passed a really good ballot initiative to help secure voting rights, so we are off to a great start already! Feels good to be in a state that is healing from minoritarianism.
