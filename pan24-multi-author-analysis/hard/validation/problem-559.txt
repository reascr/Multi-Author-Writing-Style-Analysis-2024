More like Russia being cut off like North Korea. For this to be a proper cold war, Russia would need to be a near peer adversary, which suggssting nowadays would rightly get you laughed out of a room.
Yeah but arms control agreements between DC and Moscow were in some ways characteristic of the Cold War. What we have now is Moscow trying to rearm, gambling that the West has no appetite to do the same, and wonâ€™t reciprocate with an arms race.
And Russia isn't going to be able to crank out the nearly 4,000 missiles required to throw everything they have any time soon. I'd be surprised if most of their arsenal, which is liquid fuelled and takes a lot more to maintain, credibly works given that our Minutemen III are roughly the same age, we take impeccable care of them, and are solid fuel, still occasionally have issues.
That's fine, they have no way to build the launch systems en masse again to take advantage of their stockpiled warhead advantage over us for the very foreseeable future. They've already been trying to circumvent MAD and treaties associated to contain it by getting strategic hypersonics to work, which luckily are still a long long ways off too.
They have a far larger arsenal on paper, but START made sure they don't have the launch systems active to take advantage of that.
