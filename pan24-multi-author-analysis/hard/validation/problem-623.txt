Age was the real discriminant here. White women under 45 were majority Democratic, over 45 is where it flips over to Republican. The latter group just ends up dominating the overall category because, surprise, older people are more likely to vote.
If anything I've gotten more liberal as I've gotten older and more successful, I don't believe in the old "If you're not a liberal when you're [young age] you have no heart, if you're not a conservative when you're [middle age] you have no brain" adage at all lol.
I read earlier that younger generations aren't Republican because, if you're under like thirty five, you've never seen the Republican party do absolutely anything positive for you.
I'm guessing the older white women that still voted against their interests just don't understand the link between the Republican party and the death of Roe?
It’s because white republican women are pick-mes deep down and they prove it every time they’re at the ballot box and vote against their womanhood for white male proximity.
Don't forget that brain dead lazy white women are are all for pro-choice but are too fucking lazy to go out and vote. They think bitching on twitter is the same thing as doing something to change.
It's like in 2016 when they were all like "Trump won?! How?1" and people asked if they voted and they go of course not.
