what's true is that Biden did way bigger progress in fighting unemployment in his first 2 years than Trump did in 4 and Obama did in 8.
If the question is whether there's inflation, and the overall economy is shit, there's no question, but it becomes more nuanced when you ask whether it'd be way worse without the actions the Biden admin has taken.
The fact that the midterms weren’t a referendum on Biden with inflation at historic highs is a sign of Biden’s meeting the moment, not of his inadequacy.
The thing is, I can't really see how Biden influenced the outcome of the election apart from the lack of scandals he had... And if his actions were influential I think that would've been reflective in his approval-ratings. The midterms went on and we won in spite of him if anything, not really because of him in my view. Exit-polls show this that people voted on the issues even though they consciously did not approve of Biden's job. Now I personally think Biden did pretty well given the circumstances, but I also think most other average Presidents could've done the same... Good Presidents perhaps could've wielded the bully pulpit even more effectively.
Biden has been the most impressive and progressive president, and in my opinion, the best president we've had so far.
I agree generally with your framing - but the neutral enthusiasm for Biden is part of his genius in this moment. It’s why he beat Bernie. And trump. And held the senate.
