Obviously the purpose of this sabatoge was to cut off a potential energy route (not in use) from Russia to Europe. I guess I can suspect Russia, but who do you all think it was and why?
And there's no more fear and uncertainty in Europe than there was when Russia invaded. Everyone in Germany knows they need to ditch piped Russian gas and find alternative energy sources.
But once fighting in Ukraine had stopped (he thought he'd control Ukraine by March) he likely hoped that Germany would shrug its shoulders and get back to buying gas; that happened in 2014 after Russia seized Crimea. That couldn't happen this time if he ordered the pipeline blown and Putin hoped (tho he was a fool in this regard) that us relatively wealthy Europeans would once again buy his gas in future.
Russia, since they can't throw Europe out of a window they can cut off a significant portion of Europe's energy supply which they did after they secured other trade routes for that gas. It certainly beats having to keep throwing all those Gazprom executives out the window to avoid the feedback influence Europe was having in Russia.
