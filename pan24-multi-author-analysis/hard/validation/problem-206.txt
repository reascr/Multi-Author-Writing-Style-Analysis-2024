My mother figure is in Russia. She hates the war herself, but between her mother who she has to support, her lack of personal income (is a digital artist but has to play cat and mouse to get commissions... She changed payment methods 4 times this year I think.), and her husband's inability to consume non-russian news because he cannot speak any language but Russian, she cannot get out on her own. Plus at this point, much of Russias exits have been cut off one way or another.
The normal Russian who had any savings already took them and left for anywhere but Russia. And spending them in other countries, helping their economies with what little they can.
It could work in theory, when nobody votes. Problem is, there’s more people who do vote in America, afaik, and back in Russia even if you voted they’d just falsify the results.
I know. It took a major amount of luck for me to leave and I may very well have to come back, considering how hard it is to get a job. I knew it would be tough but the prospect of having to admit failure is looking on the horizon.
