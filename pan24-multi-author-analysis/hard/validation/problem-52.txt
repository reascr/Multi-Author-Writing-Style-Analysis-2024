Not to support dailymail (Broken clocks, as you know), but the West pretty much is waging an economic war against Russia right now, and are actively supplying a side with more logisitical value than any other power could ever dream of getting. Rightfully, might I add in case anyone gets any ideas.
Demanding a surrender of some kind (Like GTFOing out of all of Ukraine) for the lifting of sanctions is technically terms of negotiation that would fit the bill.
Of course they can offer surrender terms the west is backing Ukraine, like it or not Ukraine is not the only one who gets a say in this as long as they are getting western backing.
I do worry that these will be the conditions under which the West will want Peace, so they will be unwilling to provide Ukraine with support in retaking Crimea.
But in NO WAY will Ukraine agree to leave Crimea in Russian hands or give up on the quest for prosecuting war criminals or reparations.
And do the Russian people not believe that war criminals should be punished by an international tribunal?
Reparations come from a lot of money seized from the most wealthy. Why would this piss off Russians?
Piss off the Russian people? You mean the thousands upon thousands of young men who have fled the country in order to avoid the war?
