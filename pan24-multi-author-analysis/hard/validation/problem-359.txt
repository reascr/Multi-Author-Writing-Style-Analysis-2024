Just think of the bullshit that could flow from that scenario. Say you were an employee of the state of Texas and your spouse was getting cancer treatment paid for through being on your family plan.
Don't forget the equally important detail that if you are already married and Obergefell is overturned you won't suddenly wake up one morning to find your marriage annulled - with all the legal and medical problems that would entail.
Then in that case the compromise of "you can serve, but you have to stay in the closet" was a shitty result, but it was a lot better than "you can't serve at all, and the cops will track you down to kick you out.".
This is how it should be. It is a bit crazy how closely intertwined religion still is with government, and the ramifications that has for everyone. It makes no sense for "marriage" to have arbitrary religious qualifications when marriage holds legal weight for everyone.
I think it should be obvious that marriage equality isn't some special privilege, it's an inherent right. Otherwise, heterosexual marriage is a special privileged (tax, legal etc) status only open to some individuals.
Either 'married' is a term with 0 legal, governmental, employment, healthcare or financial implications, or it is a status open to all mutually consenting adults.
