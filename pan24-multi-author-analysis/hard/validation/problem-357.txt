I never had any issues with people from Poland. They work hard, have been friendly. But this PiS BS must end.
This blaming for things, the PiS wouldn't do either. Or did I miss that Poland asked the US for export permission? Or sent troops and lost NATO protection?
As far as I now, Poland asked the US for Patriots and troops to handle them. Poland also bought some. I confused these two systems and thought Poland operates patriots.
Poland does not have Patriot system. Best Poland had was S-125 Newa-SC which was recently photographed in Ukraine. Another system Poland supposedly sent are short range 9K33 Osa systems. Polish AD forces were like Polish submarines, stuck in 60s/70s. Now they are being upgraded but deliveries just began.
The systems in southern Poland are US Army patriot systems set up around Rzeszów. As of why, well It is not a big secret most of supplies for Ukraine are flown there, as well as supplies for 10000 US Soldiers who are stationed in this region of Poland.
That's correct one is protecting the Rzeszów airport which is the main hub for receiving military aid destined for Ukraine and the other is protecting US troops stationed in western Poland.
