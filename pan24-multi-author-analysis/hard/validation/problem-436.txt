But that's a win for the EU and Ukraine. Russia issuing passports in Crimea in the name of another land is admitting that they don't have the authority to issue passports in Crimea's name. This is not a "sanction" against Russia, but rather the EU saying "I don't think you own Crimea, so this passport you issued in a foreign Ukrainian city doesn't make any more sense to me than if you said it was done in Barcelona or Berlin".
This is what the EU is saying: The "new Russian territories" are Ukrainian land, so Russian authorities doing anything "official" there don't have any more authority, in the eyes of the EU, than a random dude claiming his house is a country. A passport expedited by Russia in Kherson, according to the EU, hasn't been expedited by a competent authority of the city, so for all they care it's a forged one.
For Crimea Russia used to issue passports with "issuer: Krasnodarsky Krai" (a neigbouring Russian region) instead of "issuer: Republic of Crimea", that's how EU can't distinguish passports from legitimate Russian ones.
Here the passport is deemed illegitimate because the country issuing them (Russia) is giving them to people who aren't Russian. It's what I understood anyway.
I think people already understood the situation. Those legitimate Ukrainians need to get refugee status, after all, they are at war. EU cannot accept Russian passports from the region cause of national security issues should be very understandable.
