Yeah, but Putin and Kim Jong Un had good relations with Trump. . . that's doesn't make them pro-American.
Khan was overtly anti-American. Why would we want him in power. The reality of international politics is a friendly but corrupt leader is preferable to an unfriendly honest one. AND Khan wasn't honest so. . .
India gets more respect than Pakistan because it didn't bolster the Taliban, it's less poor and more democratic. But MOST important from the American perspective is that it is seeking to counter Chinese influence in the region. While Pakistan is accepting Chinese influence in it's country.
Khan wasn't terrible but he was opposed to the American agenda in the area and that made him "bad" from the American international politics perspective.
On the contrary, Khan believes in the principles of liberalism; hence, opposed U.S intervention since democracies do not interfere in other democracies...
To reiterate, Khan is a proponent of liberalism in IR; where democracies do not interfere in other democracies...
