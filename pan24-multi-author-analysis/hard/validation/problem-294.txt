With how successful the Ukrainian special forces have been inside Russia, if they wanted to kill Putin they probably could pull it off. But that doesnâ€™t necessarily end the war. It might make it worse.
Do you honestly not see how it could make it worse lol? Plenty of Russians in high places could start thinking that a nuke is the appropriate response to their glorious leader being killed.
Killing Putin in the Russian mind would mean their views are justified, that they are the real victims of this war and Putin indeed had no choice but to defend against the brutal west.
It doesn't do so, because at the moment Putin at least knows that doing so would mean risking his live as well as there would be a chance the West would respond. (Or it would make the Ukrainians say fuck it, nothing to loose).
Don't get me wrong - I am absolutely not a fan of Putler and him being death would bring me some joy. But Realpolitik means that the circumstances of his demise are important for the faith of Europe in the next 50 years.
But a new player with a less established power base who gets executed by his own when he is not radical enough? Totally different story.
