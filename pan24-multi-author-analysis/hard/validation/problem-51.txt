I don't know about the Belarussians that go to your church, but in my old job the CEO and the entire development team are Belarussian and they hate Lukashenko with a passion as a corrupt dictator. Many of our devs including the CTO were arrested and beaten during the protests of the previous election. Some of our guys fled to Ukraine to escape being shot, just in time for the invasion.
To them, Luka is Putin's lapdog who is skating on thin ice. The moment Luka pisses off the populace by sending Belarussian troops, his ass is grass and he'll be taken down. He's a dictator trying to survive, just like Putin. It's just that Putin has fewer teeth right now than his own citizens.
Just as Trump is just now finding out, no one likes a loser, Putin. But to be fair, if Western powers really did see Kyiv fall in 3 days when the invasion started, there wouldn't be so much global support for Ukraine.
When something happens they won’t do anything, but if (very much hypothetically) Russia were to be attacked they’d be screaming from the rooftops how other CSTO countries aren’t helping them.
Honestly one has to wonder what the hell was the purpose of invading Ukraine if it meant that Russia's role as a peacekeeper among CSTO was severely compromised as a result?
It gives the sense that this botched and insane invasion of Ukraine came from the utter delusions of a madman who knows he's getting old and rather than dying with Russia in a somewhat good position on the global stage he decided that he needs some bizarre, batshit insane conquest to add to his legacy as the president of Russia.
