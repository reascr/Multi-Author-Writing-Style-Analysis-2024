98% an accident, but the response will be critical. Otherwise a missile will hit downtown Lublin or a supply depot in Rzesz√≥w and Russia will be like ‚Äúoops sowwy ü•∫‚Äù all over again.
I would hope that an expeditious deployment of high grade western anti-air systems, from Patriot to C-RAM comes of this. Ukraine should not need to even consider defending itself with 1970s soviet junk that might as well be a bow and arrow compared to what we have.
Their goal is to make Ukraine part of Russia, bringing NATO into the war would be counterproductive to say the least.
The distinct impression I've had for a while is that Russia is trying to avoid further NATO involvement. Sure, their in-house propaganda says that NATO is fighting a proxy war with Ukraine but they probably know that they'd be in even worse shape if they drew NATO into the war.
my armchair conspiracy is that Russia knew they were going to do something to piss Europe off even more beyond just striking at Ukraine today.
Also there are reports that Russia mysteriously shut off the druzhba pipeline to Eastern Europe before the missile attack.
