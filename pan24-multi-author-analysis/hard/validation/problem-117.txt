Filed in federal court on the eve of Election Day, the lawsuit argues that a Pennsylvania state law requiring voters to date the outer envelopes of absentee ballots "has no relevance to determining whether an individual is qualified to vote, in violation of the Civil Rights Act, and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right.".
I take this as they just want to make sure as many votes are counted, because that’s how elections are supposed to work. Throwing ballots out due to a missing date, even though they have been postmarked, shouldn’t affect the validity of the ballot.
So yeah... if you don't think about it sure that totally makes sense to invalidate votes based on a date that's not necessary as they have already been provided before the date.
Yeah dates that are trying to be used to disqualify under the requirement they be received before end of election day. If they are already turned in, obviously they arrived before election day.
I don't think democrats think these are all Fetterman votes, but legitimate votes should be counted either way. I do think Republicans consider these votes to not be in their favor, this being one of many cases they are trying to prevent legitimate votes from being counted in order to try to win in various districts/states.
Not sure the argument is more under the assumption that it will benefit democrats, than it is more the belief that in a functional democracy all votes should be counted, no matter who they are cast for. I agree the right has decided it will benefit them NOT to count those due to the history of the left voting early and absentee. I am a far leftist and believe all votes should be counted even if it will not benefit my side.
