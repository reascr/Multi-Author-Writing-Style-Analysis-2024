Biden should step down gracefully, saying something like he never intended on a second trem because of his age. A fresh face would only help the democrats by eliminating the republicans main attack strategy, his age. The democrats have several rising stars like cory booker (Obama 2.0). Avoiding kamala might be hard.
I don't believe all women are unlikable. I really liked Stacey abrams, maybe for VP. Kamala just has this prosecutor/mean teacher vibe. You can tell she has been trying to change this perception. As VP her press conferences have been much more approachable then earlier in the primaries.
Then do it in the re-election announcement speech. Do it on the stump. Do it at the Democratic National Convention speech. Biden is going to have plenty of opportunities to shit on Republicans. SOTU is about the country.
I'm all for politics, and even dirty politics, but the SOTU should be different. Sure, praise the things you've done, how they've helped the country, and set out your agenda for what you want to do in the future, but it's not the time for attacks.
And I get it, Biden is far from the first person to turn the SOTU into a stump speech, and I expected no better of Biden. Still.
