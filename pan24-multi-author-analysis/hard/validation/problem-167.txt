That's really damn sad. Whoever's job it is to look after these fish must be devastated. You only have healthy tropical aquariums at the hands of people who care.
Not uncommon in aquariums. Water exerts a massive amount of outward pressure on the glass. Usually, it’s caused by a tank being unlevel because then that portion of the tank gets more pressure than the rest.
In home aquariums you have to keep an eye on your tank because they can go unlevel as the floor in your house settles and cause a tank to explode.
In a full scale aquarium, at least based on the one I've been behind the scenes of, they have the extra capacity to do this, at least for most tanks.
OTOH, I've been advised that this was not a stand-alone system, but was part of a larger aquarium, so they may have also had something already available.
A normal aquarium, you can, at least in theory, move animals to a different area, drain an area, remove and replace fatigued material. But for this, I can't see any way to deal with it at all. You'd basically need a second tank of roughly the same size, and have to remove and replace the entire cylinder.
instead of aiming for the worlds largest tank, they could’ve had more small, safe and attractive looking tanks. with live plants, etc etc.
