Unless I’m wrong, Kamala Harris only votes if there’s a tie. Even if Dems are 51 to 49, if Manchin and Sinema are both opposed, that’s still 51 nays to 49 yays, so no tiebreaker vote.
If we have 51 Dems that just means we get to cater to one less Dem, but we’re still stuck between Manchin or Sinema at any given moment which sucks.
It’s a problem with the way the Democrats work in general I think, less so the amount. Anything else than a total majority and everyone can be on the same side and say fuck the republicans, but once they’re in power, someone’s gonna take the position to gunk things up for the rest of them because now they have the power and they can, and the Dems are much less unified than Republicans have been in the past.
And of course, judicial confirmations, leading committees, and at least a chance, however small, of actually passing meaningful legislation even if the Dems lose the House (which it is looking like they probably will, but not definitive yet) because any Republican Majority in the House so far looks to be slim.
You have to take into consideration the trends historically of the sitting presidents party losing many seat and the fact that if thw gop didn't gerrymander every state they could we wouldn't be talking about who would take the house, because the democrats would have easily taken it if not for gerrymandering. Republicans stack the odds in thier favor and still lose. They're a dying party and we are witnessing the beginnings of that.
