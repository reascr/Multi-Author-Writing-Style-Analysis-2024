SMH…I feel like the GOP wouldn’t exist if their voters just used an iota of common sense and critical thinking.
If only republicans spent as much time supporting voters instead of regularly cheating their own constituents….
Aren't Republicans supposed to ALSO research the candidates who will be representing them and their supporters to make sure they aren't lying to their entire party, though?
You act as if the people actually doing the damn lying are somehow innocent in all this. Yes, better opposition research should have been done...but YES, they absolutely hold some culpability in their selected candidate, that they are both running and funding, lying about almost everything in his life. If a Dem was caught doing this, you bet your ass they would definitely get some of the blame...to only put this on the opposite party is extremely short sighted and hypocritical as shit.
If every GOP candidate/politician has something obviously shitty about them, that will inevitably get reported on. If the media is calling out/“attacking” a disproportionate amount of GOP candidates, it starts to look like political prosecution rather than honest reporting. If it looks like political prosecution to the voters, they can convince themselves the accusations are untrue they remain steadfast in their convictions and keep voting R with a clear conscience.
