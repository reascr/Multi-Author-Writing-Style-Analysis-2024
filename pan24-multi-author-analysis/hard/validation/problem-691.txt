Itâ€™s also probably good to remember it took the GOP, what, 50 years to get us here. Three election cycles is a tiny fraction of that.
But the Republican votes are becoming more prevalent, not less. this election more repubs voted then Dems. How do you square that with them dying? Esp in the Midwest, repubs turned out in record numbers. I've been saying they're going to die out for the last 30 years but this is the worst I've seen in my 40something years where repubs turned out as much as they did.
You also have to remember my generation, while smaller than both millennials and boomers, still votes mostly repub too (which grates my gears).
More Republicans voted this last midterm than Dems did. Some of the Dems won by such a small lead, it was almost non-existent. People are still voting for Republicans in huge numbers. It seems like more and more people are turning Republican. It's scary. For the first time in a long time gallup has more registered Republicans than Democrats and less independents than ever.
