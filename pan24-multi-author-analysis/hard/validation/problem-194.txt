The innocent blood of children is being shed in the hands of the Saudi regime, as the number of executions of minors has seen a slight increase in the past six years. The thought of children being subjected to the horrors of torture and denied a fair trial before facing the death penalty is beyond unacceptable and reprehensible.
They execute protestors and minors under torture who never hurt or killed anyone without fair or public trails. They also execute activists and whistle blowers, and people who voice their disagreements. They even killed and handed death sentences for people who refused to leave their homes for Neom project.
I don't get how you compare US death penalty of ruthless murders after appeals and public trails to that shithole. Also if you compare them by % of population , it's 20 times that of the US. It's just another level.
I was advocating to stop western and US support to these dictatorships and get their hands completely out of the region. First of all, sanctioning SA regime wouldn't turn them into Iran 2.0 , they don't have quarter of half of the balls of Iran. They literally lost an 8-yr war against a minority militia in part of Yemen who were supported by Iran. Iran has been able to survive US and western sanctions, built its own military, develop nuclear weapon, and have relationships with other axis of (evil) powers in the world like China and Russia. Without US and Israel , this regime will not survive a week. Second of all, let's say they turned into Iran 2.0. Well Iran and SA are very alike. They're both different faces to the same currency; both are barbaric inhumane dictatorships. Why would you be mad if they fought? Who are you cheering for? No one but evil is fighting for these governments that oppress, loot and don't represent their people. A civil unrest is indeed probable between citizens and the renaming cartel members of the regime, but again how loyal are those people when we've seen them switch sides as soon as the payments stop. For that, yes there's no other way how the region will have to decide to rule themselves afterward. It's possible they end up with another dictator but it would still be better without influence from the west empowering and choosing dictators for them. Why is that? I'll say in 2.
