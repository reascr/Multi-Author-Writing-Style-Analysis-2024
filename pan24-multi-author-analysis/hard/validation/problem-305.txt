Come on dude, no one takes you seriously outside of the US. Blocking roads is somewhat terroristic but blowing someone's face of for being on "your" lawn or you feeling threatened is just your God given right? .
P.S. if you want to be green, using less energy in general is the single best way to save carbon. Your electric SUV is not making anything better.
The overall renewable share of energy, i.e including fuels, is still super mediocre at 15% or so. So enough reason to protest.
You can protest full stop. There is no approval process, despite some local governments trying to turn the registration requirement into a de facto permit system.
This is simply not how the law works, protests are not a favour to be granted at a specific place. Instead, the starting point is the protestorâ€™s choice where and how to protest and that the government must do their very best to facilitate this. Restrictions and bans can only be instituted for a handful of specific reasons and must a applied as sparingly as possible.
The government may impose restrictions for a handful of reasons, but only ever the least possible to alleviate them.
