Your take amuses me a little. Do you not see that your position precisely plays exactly into the divisive narrative that China and Russia play up? How is this irony lost on you?
Their quick and dirty playbook is simple- foment discord within domestic groups; promote an “us vs them” mentality and get the domestic population to start mistrusting those who it perceived as having power - and if you can get more than one group to dislike and mistrust another than more power to you.
Focusing solely on perceived enemies and false equivalencies (conservative MP’s ≠ QAnon nutters) not only suggests your personal bias (hence my disengagement), but is used by bad state actors to foment civil strife as a secondary goal.
It also distracts from evidence that we have that the Chinese are very much attempting to influence all parties. In the last election we had disturbing allegations of electoral interference against conservative candidates, including who proposed a registry to track foreign influence in election campaigns. O’Toole also alleged interference which initially seemed like sour grapes until CSIS confirmed that there were indeed significant attempts to influence certain ridings.
I don’t like these QAnon nutters either, and it’s been widely suggested that these folks are being unwittingly influenced by foreign actors - but if you let your personal bias blind you to how widespread this is, it hurts the country.
