>On the campaign trail ahead of the midterm elections, Fetterman repeatedly vowed to support the end of the filibuster in the Senate if it would allow for key legislation to pass on gun control, labor protections, abortion rights, or voting access.
Also, do you really believe that McConnell and the GOP wouldn't eliminate the filibuster themselves if they retake the Senate and Presidency in 2024 and it was blocking their legislation from becoming law?
If it passes the senate because they got rid of the filibuster and it goes to the house, since dems don’t have the majority, it’ll be less likely to pass since probably no republican will vote for it.
Quite honestly either way if a party can control the house of representatives the Senate and the White House, then they deserve to be able to pass the legislation that they want to pass.
I would hope they would be willing to vote for something given the public pressure, but I feel like they would just be vindictive if they got rid of the filibuster.
If you undo the partisan gerrymandering and voter suppression by eliminating the filibuster for a voting rights bill, then a lot more than half the voters will be voting for Democrats. Republicans have kept the margins incredibly tiny because the filibuster exists, despite the demographics of the country shifting against them.
For Circuit Courts and below, and only because the GOP first decided to refuse to confirm any judges, regardless of their qualifications, because they hated Obama.
