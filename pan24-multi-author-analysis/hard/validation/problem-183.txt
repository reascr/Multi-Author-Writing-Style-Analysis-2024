A video of Iranian fans unfurling a large Ukrainian flag in the stands during the game was posted online.
The Russian troops south of Ivanivske are getting mowed down by Ukrainian armor. Especially the one Ukrainian MBT which circles around a Russian dugout and fires several time upon them. What a carnage for Russians.
Keep the eye on the prize: this war is to kick Russia out of Ukraine. The Russians want to say it is a war to destroy Russia. It is not. It is a war to make Russia's invasion of Ukraine fail. That is why there is a war: because Russia invaded Ukraine. And that is what the object of the fighting is: to remove the invader from Ukraine.
Ukrainians protested domestic tyrants not for the E.U., sorry, and accession to the E.U. isn't a victory for ukrainians either. It's not even that important, it's more like people just don't mind getting into the E.U., they don't understand what it means well enough. And it definitely doens't balance out all the deaths and destruction. It's NATO that's important, because it could prevent that from happening in the future.
This seems to be a very important lesson for EU and Nato. Keeping critical information classified or obfuscated is a very important part of propaganda, but at the same time you must have the actual true information flowing between critical government and military entities in the alliance. This requires some common ways of working from all parties involved.
