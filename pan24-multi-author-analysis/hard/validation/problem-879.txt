And yet, millions of Ukrainians remain displaced, their homes destroyed, and most of their financial lives ruined.
The original post is absolutely true. Putin was a joke until he wasn’t. Sure we here in the US can laugh and call him a joke. I bet millions of Ukrainians don’t share that same sentiment.
You’re missing the point. N Korea could still level S Korea if they wanted to. Sure, that’s about all they could do before we wiped them from the face of the earth. Nevertheless, they could still kill tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of S Koreans if they choose to.
It's more likely we'd completely genocide North Korea with conventional weapons before they actually took out Seoul. Their nuclear weapons are essentially firecrackers, and they don't have enough of them to get through the ballistic missile defenses in place. Not to mention the short range factor.
The real problem with North Korea is mopping up after their failed offensive. You'd need to build a giant wall to keep the Northerners from fleeing into South Korea, and many of them would be fleeing to start a street-level insurgency. You're not talking about "trillions of dollars of massive infrastructure damage," but hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of civilian casualties are not off the table.
The problem is you now have millions of impoverished civilians with no education who hate your guts and have been trained to believe you're the devil to deal with. And if you thought Iraq or Afghanistan was a quagmire... we'd be ten trillion dollars deep into attempting to rebuild North Korea and they'd still be fighting an insurgency (probably funded by China for funsies, no less).
Not even South Korea's interested in that mess anymore. Everyone's pretty happy with the tinpot dictator status quo, for better or worse.
