The are plenty of permits where no drilling is going on. And refining capacity is lower than pre-pandemic levels so even if there were more oil from more drilling, this industry-created bottleneck remains.
I believe a lot of this is because oil companies are refusing to reinvest into drilling and other production expanding activities. So like many other companies with a whole lot of cash flow (Apple) and nothing to buy they’re buying back shares. In part because of an adversarial environment for permitting and bleak long term outlook partially due to the Biden administration. So it’s a bit hypocritical for this administration to point and yell about share buybacks and artificial supply constraints when they’re doing everything to stop drilling. In the long term I believe it will probably be best to incentivize alternative forms of energy generation by making stringent and costly hurdles for oil extraction. But to pretend like this isn’t a side effect of those policies is a bit disingenuous.
