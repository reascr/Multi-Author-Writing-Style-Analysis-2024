Because the straight between Honshu and Hokkaido is the only direction they can fire a missile long distance without the missile flying over land, especially over South Korea, China, or Russia.
With all the military material they are sending to Russia and the constant missle launches, my hope is that North Korea will actually have no weapons to fight with if they decide to invade South Korea.
North Korea most likely put out some form of advance notice of this test, specifically so it did not result in a response that involved an Ohio-class submarine opening missile tubes.
I seriously doubt that it was carrying a nuclear warhead. ICBM testing is one thing. ICBM testing that includes nuclear warheads, falling near other countries, is a recipe for escalation that North Korea wants no part of.
Errr, they have nuclear warheads, and now they’re demonstrating that they have ICBM capabilities. What they’re working on now is combining the two: mounting those warheads onto the right missiles. They are way beyond firecrackers.
Who provides the tech? We all do. They buy through all sorts of shell companies. For example, Iran was using Siemens controllers for their centrifuges which is how we targeted them with Stuxnet. So basically they are importing things illegally via the black market.
Nuclear weapons are a defence for the Kim regime. It’s a 100% guaranteed protection from invasion or any attempts to overthrow them. Basically it’s an insurance policy. That’s what I said a few posts ago when I said they’ll become untouchable.
