Trump lost his best legal tools when he left the White House, including his ability to appoint the Attorney General, and the protection of an internal Department of Justice policy that a sitting president cannot be federally indicted.
Experts say yesterday’s verdict is a sign that more serious criminal charges could be on the way for Trump. Trump’s company, the source of his ego-boosting fortune, was found guilty on Tuesday afternoon of all 17 counts in a corporate tax fraud case.
The verdict could signal the start of a new season of legal accountability for Trump, since it shows that a jury can be convinced to reach a guilty verdict—17 times in this case—in a matter directly touching Trump.
The other premise in the article was that this guilty verdict for the Trump Organization would lead to criminal prosecution of Trump himself. It's part of a rebranding. Trump is now looking like a loser. Future indictments will not look like partisan political attacks. MAGA loyalists will complain. But most Americans will think that Trump deserves what he gets.
