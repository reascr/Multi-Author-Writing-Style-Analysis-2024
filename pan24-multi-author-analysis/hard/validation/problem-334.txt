I don't see this happening. Syria is exhausted and divided. Iraq is divided and Iran is boiling. Best they can do is for some of them to give TÃ¼rkiye a blank check to do what it wants and maybe some help, but 3 of those 4 countries are way too in over their own heads with fuck ton of other shit to be doing any warring against the Kurds at this point.
I don't trust this news at all, at least not until some other sources confirm it, however, even if it is true, I can only see it going one of two ways: They talk big game but it all falls apart later on and status quo continues . Or, Turkish troops withdraw and maybe provide some military assets to Syria to get them to do the fighting and Syrian regime botches it, either intentionally or through sheer incompetence.
An added benefit is the that Syrian regime would attempt to wipe the "rebels" out, instead of Turkiye who eventually would be stuck with an armed insurgency. They can later step in as heroes and get public support if the regime can't recapture it.
Keep this in mind. Nothing is set in stone yet. We have no insight to this meeting. Even if this report is verified later, the reality usually change within a week.
That's a security risk in a much weaker state if they are serious about annexing parts of northern Syria later on.
He's leaving the North west, not north east. Judging from the understanding mentioned in the article it seems Turkiye and the Syrian regime will target Kurdish militia together with Russian backing.
