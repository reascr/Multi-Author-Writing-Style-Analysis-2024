California has had this practice for years and it's helping to keep animal shelters from euthanizing many great pets.
The animals I encountered were from the humane society, and a shelter run by a local vet. Not to say it never happens, but I am very familiar with the shelters in my area, and they are absolutely not buying dogs.
In Ontario, Canada, this is what our pet stores do. any cats, dogs or rabbits you see come from a nearby shelter. You have to apply to the shelter to adopt. We also have a cat cafe (you can go and have a coffee and hang out with cats) which also works with a shelter and adopts animals out.
I got my cat from a pet store which worked with a local rescue/adoption agency to actually source their animals. I assume this law would allow for similar arrangements? So it's not even more difficult for prospective pet owners, from their perspective it's still "going to the pet store," the only change is that every animal adopted is a rescue.
This is a very good thing, for those who think it will make it more difficult to buy pets, yes, but only slightly which is a good thing. Breeders are still able to breed/sell their animals, those who really want them still have a fairly easy way to get them. This leads to slightly more thinking/planning and less impulse buying of animals who later end up in shelters. Not all things should be impulse buys, pets are with you for years and require constant attention. This will also help shelters, not only will less animals end up there, a lot of pet stores will partner with shelters to feature some of their animals to attract customers and drive adoptions.
