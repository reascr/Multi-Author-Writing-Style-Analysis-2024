He’s a Republican. He is going to do Republican things, that’s a given. My only point here was to point out that when it comes to Trump we would have an impeachment if other Republicans followed his lead.
Romney also voted Once not to impeach him AND helped Trump steal two SCOTUS seats. He also votes lock step with the GOP on Judges and refused to vote on anything bipartisan like infrastructure that the Dems worked out deals with the GOP for. Romney isn’t a man of principals. He is an opportunist. His vote to impeach was only to set him up to survive the Grand old Purge that’s about to happen to his party when the pendulum swings back towards sanity. At least opportunist cowards like Paul Ryan hid during Trumps reign so he could return an look like a return to sensibility. The reality is all of the GOP enabled all of Trumpism Romney included.
Romney did not endorse Trump, did not vote for Trump, and voted twice to convict Trump. Romney has repeatedly, consistently, and regularly criticized Trump for seeding racism, white supremacy, being a fascist demagogue, and generally being a unpresidential narcissistic blowhard.
Romney has been harder on Trump than any other Republican in office and I hope that he continues to be vocal well into the future.
I am not a Republican and I don’t support Romney in any way, but when it comes to going against your party and against Trump, Romney is the bravest person in Congress.
Just my opinion, we should embrace and differentiate Republicans who are willing to work with us on at least some issues. Seems like everyone is waiting for 30 years from now when we may have 75% of both the House and Senate, and also have the WhiteHouse and Supreme Court.
