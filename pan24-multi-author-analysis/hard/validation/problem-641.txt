how ‘bout vaccinated donate for vaccinated, and unvaccinated patients can only get blood from unvaccinated donors, and let’s just fuckin’ see how that plays out...
Yeah I mean wouldn’t not giving vaccinated blood to unvaccinated people solve the same problem that that guy is presenting in that, they don’t know if the blood is safe? If you don’t know if the blood is safe don’t take it I guess.
Why would you lie to give blood? That seems insanely wrong to do ethically. It's not worth it to society to do that. The personal details help determine if your blood is safe to use. If you don't want to share personal details, regardless of sexual orientation, you shouldn't be donating blood. Also.
Sure. My guess is that will quickly exacerbate our national blood supply shortage past critical and right on into, sorry, we don't have any more blood at all. Why? Because the type of people who donate blood give a shit about their fellow humans and as such probably got the vaccine because, you know, they give a shit about their fellow humans. Anyway, fuck fascists.
One of the best things I did was kill off facebook and twitter. It's been a super peaceful year and change in spite of my continued reddit consumption.
