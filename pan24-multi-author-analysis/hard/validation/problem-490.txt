Putin is a fool. I originally thought he was smart, now I know he is just ruthless. Saying you are going to fire a nuke is only a threat. Kind of like a criminal holding a gun to someone’s head. While the gun man can kill the hostage, he will be the next to die….so, unless he has a death wish, he can’t kill the hostage.
For less than 2% of one years worth of the US military budget, the west has aided Ukraine in fight the Russian military to a stand still. Imagine if Putin fires a nuke and US and NATO open a can of whoop ass, how many hours until Russia’s nuclear capability is degraded to zero.
Russia will not risk using nuclear weapons to defeat Ukraine because if they did they know the result is the retaliation against Russia will be the total and absolute annihilation of Russia.
Putin have threatened nuke to just about anyone he is pissed at but he knows the sole purpose of NATO is to eradicate Russia if it attack any NATO members so it is reasonably safe bet (hopefully) it is his usual bluff.
Putins saber rattling with his nukes is repetitive, but it isn’t a threat we can just dismiss, especially when you remember his probable declining health and mental state, there might come a time when he really does try to take the world out with him.
While it’s fun to joke about Russia being incompetent, we really shouldn’t be assuming that their nuclear stockpile is nonfunctional. Even if only a fraction of them are functional, that’s still more than enough to devastate the rest of the world. Even if they’re degraded and lower power (from lack of upkeep of tritium or neutron sources for yield boosting or other issues) that’s still more than enough to devastate any city they attack.
