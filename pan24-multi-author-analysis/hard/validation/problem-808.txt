The EU would need to ‘drive the boat’ for a few years to ensure it won’t just collapse under their feet.
Ukraine should also be wise that if they do get their wish in 2 years though overly optimistic it is, they should do well to protect their agricultural industry and gas/oil from outside private investors who only want to profit, the locals be damned.
At best Ukraine can expect Customs Union in 2 years. 5 years-ish after that single market. A further 3 years full EU membership and possibly Schengen.
Schengen after 10 years from now? That's insanely optimistic. Romania and Bulgaria not in Schengen after 15 years in the EU.
And this in the event where Russia does not fall apart and instead become a reasonable partner who hates smuggling and corruption, so they'll presumably put up an attempt to stop it. If not, well, you got the above problem, and actors across the border intent on making things WORSE.
Schengen is not only about visas for Ukrainians. Like I said, there are countries in the EU today who are not in Schengen despite being in the EU for over 15 years, and this is despite the Comission yapping up and down about how much a travesty this is.
It does have things to work on, undoubtedly, but this is beyond criticism - this is an overblown as fuck stereotype, and if Ukrainian politicians dull their teeth after the war - EU will continue dangling membership like a carrot on a stick into the next century. Which you prove perfectly.
