The law on personal jurisdiction for corporations is not minimum contacts but state of incorporation or headquarters since Daimler in 2013. These plaintiff’s attorneys need to get their shit together - you aren’t changing recent SCOTUS PJ decisions. File in the right court and prosecute a meritorious case.
The analysis is not minimum contacts. Daimler in 2013 overruled International Shoe concerning corporate entities. You have to sue corporations where they are incorporated or their headquarters are. If you are a plaintiffs attorney with a meritorious case, why are you messing it up by ignoring clear Supreme Court precedent? As a trial lawyer, I think this is borderline malpractice.
This case is about venue, not the merits of the case. The plaintiff’s lawyers filed where their office was and not where the defendant they were suing was “located.” There’s a 100+ years of case law on where you should best sue corporate entities and you ignore that at your peril.
On the other hand as the article points out, corporations do that all of the time by requiring lawsuits to be filed in specific venues even when the consumer, corporate headquarters, and the harm occurred somewhere else.
