I definitely do, all the time. We live in a world though where people will post a question on reddit rather than using a search engine, so... whaddya do? Thanks for the updates. They're a morning and nightly ritual now as well as checks throughout the day!
Expected was 4-5 salvos remaining last time at a rate of 90-100 missiles per salvo at the time. They'll probably have to stop before they use them all to have a "strategic" reserve. The size getting smaller might be indicative of them getting closer to that point.
Arestovych said 2 or 3 months ago that very conservative numbers were 100 Russians lost there per day. It's a city previously with a population of 70,000 people so it's not small, that's very believable.
As well as what everyone else said, it also causes issues of potentially numerous multi-km long wires strewn across battlefields that need to be cleaned up.
They haven't been trying really. It's basically impossible to coordinate realistically. There's such a large disparity in speeds between the mopeds and the missiles that you need to know exactly where the air defense is to time it right, and if they knew that they'd be trying to hit the air defense.
They need more short range air defense to thwart the Iranian drones, the gepards and someone has to have some old Vulcan air defense systems stocked up somewhere, there were many thousands of them before they were decommissioned- but other countries had them too. Those would be effective and a cheaper way to stop an inexpensive drone. Save the patriots for the planes and cruise missiles.
