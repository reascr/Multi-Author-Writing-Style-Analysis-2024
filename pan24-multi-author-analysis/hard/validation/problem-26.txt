gun culture in the 90s had a massive culture shift due to the ruby ridge/Waco. Lawayne Pierre, head of the NRA ended up having an internal memo leak in 95' which lead to a lot of old guard conservatives (like HW bush) to reject the NRA. Its also the time where they changed their philosophy to what gun culture has become now.
All that said, even with owning both styles of firearms, this country is wackadoo on guns and there are a plethora of common sense reforms that should be made. There are far too many people that fetishize their guns and fantasize about taking another humans life in this country.
There are always going to be gun nuts who think they're going to overthrow the government, but there are also a lot of moderates who see guns as what they are: tools for rural life. I think most people can agree on a lot of gun control (like background checks, gun safes, proper safety training), but think (however wrongly) that "liberals are just going to take away their guns". Demonizing them is just going to make them dig in their heels, and that's just part of human nature; instead, by incorporating them as stakeholders in a future solution, that solves two problems at the same time.
Well, it's kind of a difficult conversation to have if you own a gun; of course you personally are a responsible gun owner who isn't going to shoot anybody, so why should you face more restrictions?
One way to approach this is to to tell gun owners: "of course, you're responsible gun owners who keeps their guns locked up and secured, and you've gone through training and know the basic rules of gun safety, unlike those irresponsible gun owners who are besmirching the good name of gun owners everywhere.".
Okay. So what is that based on? I can see the argument about weight, and of course that makes a great difference to some.
