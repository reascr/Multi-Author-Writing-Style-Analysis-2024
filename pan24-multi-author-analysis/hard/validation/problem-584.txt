I'm a German and my strong gut instincts tell me that these are only stalling tactic and Scholz ultimately will say 'No'. Maybe Scholz tries to stall the process only until our new secretary of defense has taken his oath and afterwards Scholz will blame him for saying 'No'. Or maybe he thinks the war will stop soon or any other nonsense, I don't know. I really hate this rat on the throne!
Yeah, they may be a good alternative for Ukraine concerning the tank-question, but they surely are not a good option for Germany.
Poland sent Ukraine tanks over 6 months ago, and Germany said it wouldn't because it didn't want to escalate things or upset Russia. Germany was asked then, and said no -- you see how what you are saying isn't correct?
You're saying it again, and it . What has happened is that pressure has mounted as to why they haven't sent tanks they said they would.
it wasn't otherwise we would have produced tanks 24/7 since last february. I absolutly hate how we treat our bundeswehr and our nato partners by letting it all rot away. this is all so dishonest and I bet there comes a day when it will cost us.
