Countries think about a lot of factors before partnering up with another. India has the economic and military potential that's why Usa sees it as valuable to partner up. Also politically India has good relations with alot of countries already like France , Japan , Israel which also happen to be Us allies. So Usa has a very good reason to partner up with India (also democratic).
Military aid can be expected from India when the ties deepens not before obviously. From your replies it seems you are not well educated on international ties so you should watch this video.
Edit: Indian govt has provided humanitarian aid which is not comparable to Russian citizens giving humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid includes alot of things but the ones India sent is probably medical equipment and medicines.
Well I think medicines and health aid should count in military aid as most of it will ultimately find its use in helping wounded soldiers.
I'm referring to weapons and other military aid which is the topic at hand. I'm sure Russian citizens have personally provided some humanitarian aid to Ukraine as well.
India hasn't even formally condemned Russia on its' invasion of Ukraine though lol like no matter how you justify it it's just so weird to me that the US is working with India militarily.
I'm just confused why the US wants to partner with India if they don't even provide military aid to Ukraine, that's all.
