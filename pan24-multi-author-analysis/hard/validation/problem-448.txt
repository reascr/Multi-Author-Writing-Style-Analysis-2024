Yeah, autocrats also usually hate intelligent people / intellectuals and try to repress them because they pose a threat to their rule. They need people to be stupid, unmotivated sheep so they can stay in power.
This is legitimately one of the reasons why autocracies are almost always shit holes compared to democracies. Creative and talented people inevitably feel repressed and choose to leave. Also see: Einstein.
The funny thing is that Einstein, as brilliant as he was, is just a marker. The real loss is in the people that make the wheel turn in all their little way.
But that really didn’t matter. Because you need whole teams of scientists that can execute that kind of idea or experiment.
During Operation Paper clip, Heisenberg and others were being held by western operatives. They were being recorded in their quarters during the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It apparently only took them a few hours to figure out how the Americans did it.
That’s how autocracies lose to democracies. Most of the smart people collectively make the smart choice en mass, which is in itself a form of democracy.
