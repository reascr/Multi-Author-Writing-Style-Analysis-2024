Precisely. To make matters worse Russia also doesn’t waste med evac resources on them so if a prison recruit is injured they’re often left to die unless they can get themselves out.
That doesn’t surprise me too much. From my understanding Russia still does med evac for their regular soldiers but things are rarely consistent so across all units so a random officer saying “don’t bring back wounded” is pretty believable.
I have a sneaking suspicion that it's absurdly hard to get soldiers to earnestly run into battle if they keep seeing their friends left injured on the field. In reality if you could get young men to run toward gunfire completely without fear, and at a much cheaper cost/battle, even modern militaries would completely forgo the no man left behind mentality. But if they actually scrapped no man left behind, there would literally be no men around, to leave behind.
As it stands, no man actually wants to be left behind and if you have a better chance at survival by dropping your weapons and walking away, most would.
