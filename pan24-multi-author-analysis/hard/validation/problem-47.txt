If you go to the Serbia subreddit you will see comments like “The Americans will be in Beograd in 2 days if they take a leisurely pace”, so no Serbians are well aware and nobody wants conflict.
As for your claim of Austria invading them to stop them expanding? Maybe read about how Serbia shocked the world when they agreed to all but one point in the Austrian ultimatum and then how Austria uses the war to ethnically cleans Serbians into mass graves.
Also it wasn’t just Serbs who opposed this behaviour (Serbs were scared, rightfully, that they are next to be annexed), it was most of the people in the region and the Balkans.
Serbs weren’t this empire that tried to steal territory all over the Balkans, we were torn between two ideas. One was consolidating a Serbian nation, which included territory that today belongs to Bosnia and Croatia because Serbs used to and to some extent still live there. The other was the pan-slavic idea that was uniting all southern slavs into a single state because we are all quite similar, and a lot of people in other areas of Yugoslavia supported that.
Since the end of the 1800s (and possibly longer), Serbian nationalists have had this idea of gathering all the slavic people into one great nation ruled from Belgrade.
Serbia and its nationalist leader did really not like the dissolution and a war raged for years with a lot of ugliness (as in most wars, but worse than many) including genocidal slaughter of Bosnians in Srebenica. Eventually the war ended, but Serbian nationalism did not end.
We now have a pseudo state, Kosovo, and Serbian pan-slavic nationalism that has never disappeared. There are many in Serbia that believe that a war to restore their empire is the way to go.
