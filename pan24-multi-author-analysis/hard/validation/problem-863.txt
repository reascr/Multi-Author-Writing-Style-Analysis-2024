Republicans cannot quit Trump because they don't want to. Republicans cannot quit Trump because every American that cares for their country is forever equating Republicans to Trump. Republicans can't quit Trump because he gave them a roadmap to overthrowing our democracy and they all got away with their pathetic attempt. Trump is Republicans and Republicans are Trump.
The GOP wants a Trump, but some just don't want the Trump. But that's not how it's going to work. You don't get to keep the cult without the cult leader.
And while money certainly helps with those, I don't see Trump playing nice if the GOP fails to protect him.
Because Trump is blackmailing key GOP members and it isn’t hard to figure out whom. Trump is the person that every single person on earth would believe is capable of blackmailing someone but it’s too “impolite” for the media to ever investigate this. Trump is a “Carrot or stick” monster. You can take the carrot and keep your job and agency (to be used to serve him) or the stick, he will release his little manilla envelope of kompromat the Russians gave him on you (Hi, Lindsey!).
