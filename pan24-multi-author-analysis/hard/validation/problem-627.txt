I see this as a subsidy for American industry. The government doesn’t necessarily have to turn a profit on projects and, in theory, the economic growth generated should come back in revenues.
And in this case we're not talking about a private corporation, we're talking about the federal government, the dollars they're spending isn't private profit, it's public tax revenues. We're talking about spending taxpayers dollars here, not Elon Musk's.
My preferred political subreddit is quick to get their panties in a bunch about Joe Biden's protectionism. Protectionism is, technically, an unforced and avoidable economic inefficiency, giving preference to a contractor besides the lowest bidder is a good way to spend more money, and in the case of the government it's the taxpayers who cover the costs....
Sure, except in this case protectionism would mean keeping money here in the United States (which is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the world) rather than buying from poorer nations where the money could do more good.
The whole point I was making was simply this: It's not black and white, there are benefits to free trade and there are drawbacks, there are benefits to protectionism and there are drawbacks.
And I think most of the countries that benefit from our free trade policy, it doesn’t really help their poor that much because their governments are so corrupt. The only country I can think of that actually, the whole country benefited and isn’t totally fucked is Vietnam.
