This is about allowing a country to defend itself from a nuclear armed government breaking all international laws and straight up annexing and trying to take over another territory that is not theirs. We have the largest military of any other nation in the planet, so much so that all we have to send these guys are old shit we don't need anymore to stop Russia from gaining territory and bordering other nato countries and you want to argue that's a bad thing and we should just let Russia do whatever it wants? Fuck you.
Because they are correct on this issue. It's really that simple. And the right wing bad faith audit is what's being pushed for and what you are defending in this thread.
I actually think you might not know enough about theory to understand what you are implying, but what happened in maidan doesn't change what needs to be done here. You might be a communist for it's aesthetics, but by propping up Russian you kill off any argument you may have against supplying defensive weaponry to Ukraine. Propping up Russian would be infinitely worse for geopolitics in this era.
This itself is Russian propaganda. Russia's little prop boy was forced out by the Ukrainians who then held a perfectly legal and democratic vote where they elected zelensky entirely democratically. It was the will of the people. Putin's little puppet boy was ousted and ran away of his own accord to avoid being prosecuted and jailed by the people of Ukraine after ramping up violence against protesters. You are falling for Russian talking points my friend. The people of Ukraine have had incredibly strong opinions about being attacked and annexed by Russia and it is clear as crystal which side they take. You may not care about the people of Ukraine enough and want to completely disregard what they want and voted for, but good thing the world doesn't side with you and your fascist opinions. Ukraine is not on your side. The Ukrainian people are not on your side. May sunflowers grow from your corpse one day.
If you don't like it you are free to.leave, but those of us who stay would rather make it a better place for all. That means not voting republican in this day and age.
It means more than just not voting republican. The democrats are just as evil; they just hide it a little better. They're gonna bomb little kiddos in the middle east just as much as the republicans will.
