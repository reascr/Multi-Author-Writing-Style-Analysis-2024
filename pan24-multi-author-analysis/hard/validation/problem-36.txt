Nominally Israel and Saudi governments have no issue with each other and have been working with each other for quite some time.
Saudi Arabia doesn't normalize relations because most of their population hates Israel; but on a political level, both are US client states and honestly quite close.
Lots of Middle East governments have been normalising relations with Israel but their populations at large still detest Israel and that won't change anytime soon, not while the whole Israel/Palestine conflict is ongoing.
For now it hasn't translated much to governments which are still heavily supportive of Israel but that isn't going to remain the same in the future if more and more of the population aren't supportive of it.
And yes whilst Israel is incredible dysfunctional politically the right and far right has been in power for the last 20 years and they have continously made the situation worse. Even if this coalition doesn't last more than a year it is still going to make policies that will have an effect.
Much of the middle east do not even see it as terrorism(which it is), rather as resistance fighters and that view isn't going anywhere either when they can put up pictures of dead civilians to Israeli missile strikes whilst ignoring the reason behind those. Media is a business and they like to highlight what sells.
