Not only just the fact that they are a neighboring Slavic peoples, but especially on the Western side of Russia, a lot of Russian people have family over there, too.
Yes, there was native support for Russian imperialism in Ukraine but this conflict has always been, undeniably, about how Russians see Ukraine and has had far less to do with how Ukrainians see themselves. If the Russians cared one iota about the will of the people they wouldn’t be currently occupying large portions of Ukrainian territory that have never had native separatist movements. Almost no one in Melitopol was clamoring to join Russia, but Russia needs it as a bridge to Crimea (the center of their conception of themselves as the third Rome). Russia wants Ukraine’s lands, they couldn’t give two shits what their people want. Putin cares about the citizens of Donetsk as much as he cares about the citizens of Kyiv. They’re both just lives that have to be sacrificed so he can maintain a hold of Crimea and his perception of himself as a modern day Tsar. That’s all this war has ever been about for him and Pro- War Russians as a whole.
Thing is, there's plenty of Russians that would answer the same. You don't have to sacrifice yourself and go to prison, you just need to be a decent person to understand what's right and what's wrong. And it doesn't make you a good Russian, it's just make you a compassionate human being. None of us is free of responsibility, besides kids who were to young in the times of Putin's raise to power. I was, and I still know that I have my share of responsibility.
To be clear and honest, I'm half Russian and half Tatar person and I am strongly against the war. I'm not interested in being considered good. But I want to understand your logic.
1. Yes, it was a war. 2. As a Tatar I believe that Crimea belongs to Tatars, but it's situated in Ukrainian borders. 3. Of course it's a full scale war. 4. Of course Russia is an aggressor.
A lot of Russians support the war. Even the ones who don’t are not in the “same predicament” as Ukrainians who live their daily lives in-between air raids, missile attacks and often without electricity because of Russian actions.
