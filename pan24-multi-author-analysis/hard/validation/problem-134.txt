When someone tells you they want to do something awful even if they aren’t able to follow through it speaks to their values and priorities. That this is a priority for the GOP (one of the only actual policy positions they hold) instead of fixing it to ensure current and future generation workers get the full benefits they were promised and have been paying into for their entire lives should tell a reasonable person everything they need to know.
Unfortunately people who are still voting for republicans have a loose grip with reality and can no longer be described as reasonable thinkers.
A lot of Republicans greet the reality of what their candidates say they are going to do with silence but it’s weird. Those words never seem to be met with any acknowledgement or even recognition that they were said. Like time stopped for them.
My 80 year old Dad behaves as if he earned these benefits while others are gaming the system. The “cheats” are whom he believes Republicans are going against. Republican politicians will say they are ending Social Security and he will say, “Yeah Ending it for the cheats”.
Edit: You know what it is like? It is like when you get a phone call from someone selling something and they are answering any questions and responding as expected until you respond with something they weren't expecting. They pause and just repeat the last thing that was said, and then you realize you are talking to an AI. That's what debating is like with one of these MAGA people who are obviously just parroting back someone else's talking points. Once you respond with something outside their programming, they pause and then say something really general like how it is a shame the country is communist now.
I have and he does not believe any actions will affect him but future generations. I then remind him his kids and grandkids are those future generations and that obliviousness or lack of awareness that something was said occurs. I can't say it is from age because I have debated with some MAGA folks younger than me and they do the same.
