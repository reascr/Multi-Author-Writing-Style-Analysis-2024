But the judge specifically channeled the will of our founding fathers, you know those revolutionaries who fought for change and progress to improve the lives of US citizens, and decided they would have been conservatively against change and progress.
The judge, appointed by Donald Trump, said that from a historical perspective the ban was "an outlier that our ancestors would never have accepted.".
Right. And if you look at the last two amendments out of ten, it's a ratified reminder that the Constitution is not a Magna Carta, literally because those debating the Bill of Rights were worried that people would make exactly the error you're making. They went out of their way to try to stop you from making that error, but unfortunately, in order to work, it still does require that you both read and understand the entire Bill of Rights at a minimum. Ideally, you'd also have a decent civics education.
This is one of those areas of the law where the plain text and meaning of the Constitution simply cannot coexist in any coherent, consistent way with the state's desire to make people safer. One of the two has to give, and a shocking number of people on this one issue will suggest that, not only should it be the Constitution, but that it should be the Constitution without a formal amendment having to be ratified.
But you think that pointing out amendments in the constitution shows that the rights aren’t established by the constitution? Good lord, ideally you’d take a class on basic logic before going full dunning kruger.
