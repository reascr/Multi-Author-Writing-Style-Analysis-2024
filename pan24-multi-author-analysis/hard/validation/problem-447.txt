That being said, Trump's presidential announcement couldn't have been placed at a worse time and was met with crickets. He didn't energize anybody and has exactly zero momentum. I imagine he's hoping to recreate his bullying the other candidates in the primary debate stage thing. Who knows if that works twice though.
I think we need some primary polling. DeSantis polls well against him amongst GOP voters, but are the people that want DeSantis people that will show up to primaries? IDK. I feel like the red in their bones Republicans still like Trump and they're the ones that vote in the primaries.
As for why...... it because the GOP voter base really hate the 'rinos' and are 'done' with the neo-political system. They will continue to throw Trump like a Molotov cocktail.
That said, in 2018 Florida passed a “resign to run” law that requires any elected official seeking a different political office to resign from their current one after announcing their candidacy.
DeSantis term ends on Jan 8, 2027 and perfect timing for him to launch an official presidential bid for 2028.
