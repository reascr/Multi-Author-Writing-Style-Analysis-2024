A heartbreaking failure of public policy to put the fragile sensibilities of people not in school ahead of proper instruction of students to ensure they don’t end up as unwed teenage mothers….
Comprehensive sex education would stop this, providing birth control would prevent this, and abortion should have been an option because I guarantee most of these girls aren't ready for the responsibility of being a mother.
That's so absolutely fucked. These kids shouldn't have their parents pulling them out of class and these people should know abstinence didn't work when they were kids and they should know that sex will happen regardless of whether or not they're taught how to do it safely.
I'd rather they learn about consent and respect and boundaries and contraception and how not to be shitty people rather than just going with "Kids suck so don't have sex and hope everything works out for you after graduation." That just normalizes them sucking.
It's a self-fulfilling prophesy, a lot like "Boys will be boys". If you tell kids it's normal for them to suck they will internalize that. We can't just pray and hope that after highschool they will learn what they need to not suck.
If they have to wait until after they are adults to start learning what a healthy relationship consists of it would already be too late.
