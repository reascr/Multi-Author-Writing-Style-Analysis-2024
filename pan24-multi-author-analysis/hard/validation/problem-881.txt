This argument has been had, fascism is inherently intolerant and its dangerous motives are hidden behind bad faith arguments and lies.
I guess my main point would be that "Nazi" is such a historical trigger word that it lets the fascists derail the conversation. Much more accurate to just use the timeless term - fascists.
Yeah fascism is way more specific. The current GOP/Maga is not just authoritarian, they're that step further that brings it into fascism. Every single one of the 14 points of fascism from Umberto Eco's "Ur Fascismo" are checked off by their current platform.
Exactly. Fascism is really like a cancer. When you detect cancer early you don't go "well let's see how it develops, rn it's not actively killing me".
Yep it's horrific. I have it bookmarked and regularly comment with quotes and the link because I feel not enough people are talking about this. Legit actual out in the open fascism.
If they tell you to define fascism, tell them to look in the mirror. They're going to disregard what you say to begin with and any opening that doesn't clearly define their fascism they will then use for their argument. Don't argue with these people, mock them, insult them, demean them, don't engage in an actual argument. It says their views are acceptable enough to argue.
