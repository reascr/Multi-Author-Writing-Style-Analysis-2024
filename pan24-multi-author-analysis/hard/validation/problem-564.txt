Interestingly, the American born Spinal Tap actor Christopher Guest is/was part of the UK’s House of Lord’s and holds the title of The Right Honorable Lord Haden-Guest, a title inherited from his late father who was a British United Nations diplomat.
"There's no question that the old system was unfair. I mean, why should you be born to this? But now it's all just sheer cronyism. The prime minister can put in whoever he wants and bus them in to vote. The Upper House should be an elected body, it's that simple.".
Now. Don't get me wrong. Hereditary titles should be gone, and it should be made up of experts in law, finance, the sciences etc...
Wait wait.. you plan do destroy the checks? The house of Lords checks the crap the MPs are trying to pass to law.
Since the House of Lords has almost no actual power, this seems like a distraction from the actual damage being done by the House of Commons.
Does that mean no politician can ever call for the removal of the House of Lords because it will always be seen as a ‘distraction’ from other political topics?
It's more a reflection on the fact that movement to remove the House of Lords is almost purely symbolic and will waste political capital that could be better spent improving the output of the real source of power, the House of Commons.
