A Gender Critical activist in the UK gave a public speech a few days ago and she quoted Adolf Hitler, basically called trans people a Big Lie that were created in the early 20th century.That we aren’t real and society has been fooled into believing we are. Another had been caught publicly talking about ways they can reduce numbers of trans people.
“They seem like they’re about protecting kids from harm, but really it’s a ploy to erase LGBTQ people from public life,” Schneider said. “It’s a scare tactic that we see all the time, but even scare tactics have a real impact on our community.”.
Andrew Schneider, the executive director of Fairness West Virginia, a statewide LGBTQ rights group, compared the bills to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law (dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics), which prohibits classroom instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity … in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”.
People who violate the bill regulating venues and performances, SB 278, could face a misdemeanor, a fine of up to $1,000 and/or jail time. Venues that allow minors to be present for performances that the bill defines as obscene or sexually explicit could face a public nuisance complaint.
I take it most of the commenters did not read the article it talks about exposing minors to explicit content not just for exposing someone to trans people.
That is to say, the bill specifically defines "transgender exposure [...] to a minor" as inherently indecent and sexually explicit. So yes, it does make exposing someone to trans people illegal.
