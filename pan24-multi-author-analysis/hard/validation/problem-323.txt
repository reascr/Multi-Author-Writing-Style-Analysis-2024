I hope every last one of the journalists using a war with very real dead people and the world at stake to generate more clicks and get more revenue gets publicly shunned. Absolutely vile.
Nice title there, Newsweek. Also they got him drunk on the podcast and started asking loaded questions, then used the answers to make a nice clickbaity title and this is the result. He said that filming prisoners of war Is in violation of international law - this turned into "Trainer says the Ukrainian army is committing attocities".
I find this very interesting tho; a media source (a shit one, sure) reports on an American who saw the war first hand who acknowledged that Ukraine is committing war crimes, and you people are mad at the media source?
I’m legitimately curious, what sources do you have that completely deny the radical history of the azov battalion?
I’ve read the whole article. Given that he issued a statement about it and didn’t explicitly say it was false, I believe it’s true. At the very least I believe he believes it is true. Ukraine is executing soldiers who surrendered. They are mistreating prisoners of war.
