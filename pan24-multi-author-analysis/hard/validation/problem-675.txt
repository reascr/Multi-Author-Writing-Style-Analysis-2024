Ukraine isn't going to stop trying to get their entire country back and will continue fighting Russia and Russia's surrogates as they have since 2014 when Crimea and much of the Donbas was taken.
They will continue to fight because they simply have no choice, for losing will result in the Russian absorption of Ukraine and the utter destruction of their country and people. It is no coincidence that some of Ukraine's strongest supporters (Finland, the Baltics, Poland and Romania) know they might be next in line if Russia expansionism is not thwarted now.
I agree with the article headline, the West should change course in Ukraine by immediately providing all the conventional military support possible that Ukraine needs to drive Russia from their lands. Ukraine is willing to spill their own blood to secure their future, so let's give them the tools to do so and end this war quickly.
Ukraine is willing to wage a fight for independence and it is right for US and EU to provide Ukraine with the means to do it. Including providing Ukraine with nuclear weapons should Russia threaten that. US, Russia, UK, Ukraine signed the , Ukraine gave up nukes in return for sovereignty. Russia broke the agreement and invaded, perfectly justified for US to provide Ukraine with the weapons including the nuclear weapons agreed to give up in return full independence from Russia.
If we want the war to truely end the only realistic solution is to offer Ukraine a secret deal where they become full joint mutual defense members with the USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. Fuck turkey and their veto over NATO membership, we can sign mutual defence treaties without them. Put US soldiers at the boarder to make it clear if Russia shoots them we will respond with decisive force.
That way Russia cannot just 'restart the war' at their convenience and Ukraine is actually getting something of value from the international community in exchange for giving up a small amount of territory (like the Crimea pininsula) assuming they are unable to retake it in a reasonable time frame.
