I am hesitant to enjoy seeing the infighting; reminds me too much of how the Republican Tea Party started.
It's sad that in the Republican Party it always seems to be extremists pulling the party to the right. And in the Democratic Party it always seems to be moderates pulling the party to the right.
To be fair, the republicans aren’t pulled right. Their messaging has always pushed their voters further right. If your message is constantly going on about crime and violence, people will eventually become primed for violence. They’ve been doing exaggerations to win elections since Reagan. No longer was it a debate firmly on ideas, it was insidious sophistry.
Nothing ever plainly said anymore. The normal people can’t see plainly who the nazis are bc they’ve all made their language politically correct to not sound any alarms. They won’t say Jews, they’ll say “George Soros.” They won’t say trans people, they’ll say “drag queen strippers.” They won’t say gay people, they’ll say “groomers.” So when the left calls it out, we look insane. And the dem party doesn’t help bc the Dem party is rife with corpo money corruption, so of course they jump on it to further purge the party of leftists who would refuse corpo money.
Bc in a civil war there are traitors, those who betray the established order. That, at least by those in power, is how its seen. So they’re calling those who oppose McCarthy, traitors to the party basically. A republican civil war where its corporate first fascists versus Christian fascists.
