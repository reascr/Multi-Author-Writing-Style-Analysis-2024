Living in Christchurch, it took months for the aftershocks to settle down and then a year later we had a 2nd quake followed by about half a year of aftershocks. That's the scary thing with quakes the big one could be right around the corner and the after shocks can still bring stuff down.
Earthquakes are weird. They affect structures based on the frequency of the vibration and the building's height. A 6.6 earthquake might not touch a building that is absolutely destroyed by a 5.6 earthquake, even though the 6.6 is so much stronger.
A bulding damaged by a near 8 richter scale earthquake is likely to collapse in a follow up 5.6 even if it would have been fine without the damage from the massive quake.
A 7.8 is 100 times as strong as the 5.7 that hit us here in salt lake. If there was a 7.8 here we'd be fucked too.
A 7.8 earthquake is fucking massive. Quakes in the 6s on the richter scale have destroyed buildings and collapsed freeways in the US in the 90s. If a near 8 happened in any American city it would be absolute carnage too.
