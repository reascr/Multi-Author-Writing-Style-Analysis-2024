I've seen this with younger Evangelical acquaintances of mine. There is a minority of them who are oriented toward social justice and inclined to support movements like BLM (maybe not the political arm of it, but the message for sure).
To be sure, this is a minority. But it's a much bigger minority than the older generations of Evangelicals.
It sounds like Gen Z Evangelicals are more intelligent than the older generation. The new documentary on Jerry Falwell, Jr. is very revealing. You had the leader of the most conservative religious university in the country ask Trump for help to bury a story that was a major scandal. You can’t make this up. His wife seduced a 20 year old pool boy, brought him back to their place, and asked if it was okay for her husband to watch. In walks Jerry Falwell, Jr.
Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, helped bury this story all while Falwell, Jr was praising Trump and promoting him to other Evangelical leaders. Will Evangelicals ever admit that they were duped by a con artist and a pathological liar? My guess is no. It is very embarrassing and reeks of the hypocrisy in the party that has intertwined religion with politics into a fucked up cult. And keep in mind, this is all while Trump’s fixer, Michael Cohen, was paying off porn star Stormy Daniels who Trump had an affair with.
