The EC president is elected by the EP, but the Council nominates candidates to be voted on. This nomination could be seen as merely ceremonial, or a formality as a safety mechanism of last resort so the Council could step in to prevent a potential despot from getting elected. In this interpretation, it's analogous to how the PM is nominated by the monarch in the UK, how the German president nominates a candidate for chancellor for the Bundestag to vote on, or along the lines of how its technically the Electoral College that elects the president in the US.
The fundamental question is one about how power in the EU is balanced, between member states' governments on the one hand, and the elected parliament, as well as the EC, on the other -- the EC becomes a politically more powerful institution if its president is chosen, not just confirmed, by a representative parliament.
You can think of the Commission (EC) as the cabinet, and its president as the prime minister. The Council represents the member states, seating its heads of government/state. Very roughly, its the upper house, the senate to the EU parliament (EP), which is the lower house.).
I have one of those. One of my best friends became a qanoner during lockdown. Now whenever I visit him I have to put up with him spouting off about gender issues, LGBT people, vaccines, the Clintons and how great Putin is. It's very tiring.
