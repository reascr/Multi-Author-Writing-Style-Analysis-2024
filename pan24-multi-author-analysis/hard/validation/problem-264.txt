One of the major issues for their Air Force isn’t a lack of planes or pilots, but a lack of munitions for their jets. Jet munitions are “smart” munitions and Russia isn’t able to make more of those with the sanctions. The only use their jets have are as kamikaze weapons since any intelligence application has been taken over by harder to target drones.
And bear in mind it's not just the aircraft and its tech, but the missiles, pilots integration of systems.
Also on top of jets, the ammunitions play a big role, and russian jet-fired weapons are league behind except in air to ground.
Russia is flying theirs low because they don't have stockpiles of precision munitions, so they have to fly lower to help ensure unguided bombs hit the target.
USAF determined the cost just wasn't worth it. F-22 is slated to be phased out starting in a decade, and they didn't think Russia or China would have enough stealth aircraft to require those investments.
F-35 is quite a bit more advanced than the F-22. The USAF wanted to export the F-22 to lower costs, and stated there was no reason to ban exports of it if they were going to be exporting the F-35, but Congress is just fucking stupid and banned it against the advice of literally everyone.
Iran would likely use their Su-35s in a pure air to air capacity, so that risk from MANPADS doesn't apply to them.
