Israel is the most diverse country in the Middle East, a democracy, gave up some of their own land to Palestine in pursuit of peace and Hamasâ€™ military is considered a terrorist organization for a reason.
Beyond that, Israel has offered peace and Palestinian control over the West Bank and Gaza but the Palestinian government refused over Israel only willing to grant a limited amount of Palestinians the right to return. Israel granting a full right to return would destroy the country and lead to more bloodshed. Because although only hundreds of thousand Palestinians were ethnically cleansed/left israel, the Palestinian governments demand was that their millions of decendents be able to return to israel. Anyone who thinks a full right to return is practical either wants more conflict and death or is living in the clouds.
I also ask why so much focus is on Israel and Palestine when there are other groups in similar situations. Western Armenia was successfully ethnically cleansed during the Armenian genocide. There's an Armenian diaspora all around the world. A holy site for the Armenian people is in another country. Currently Armenians are being killed in ethnic conflicts in lands that were historically theirs before another group came.
Jews in Israel are also dealing with groups that would see them pushed into the sea and many jews are still alive who witnessed arab attempts to wipe them out. It's remarkable they were ever willing to make concessions that would put their security at risk. Especially with all the genocidal and anti-semetic rhetoric that gets preached against them.
