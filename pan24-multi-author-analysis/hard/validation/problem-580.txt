ugh, you couldn't be more wrong. Lukashenko has been overpromising Putin and underdelivering for 20 years. French media refers to him as the most shrewd politician in east europe for a good reason. What's with Redditors thinking Lukashenko is some kind of idiot when he's Europe's longest-serving ruler, before Putin was in power.
I also have doubts about Lukashenko currently wanting any of this in fear of losing power or his life, now that oligarchs have been falling out of windows lately. His own personal state keeps a nice buffer between him and any loose windows.
At a quick search I found a Belarussian poll from 1999 in which roughly 35% of belarusians opposed a union state while 47% supported it.
And I believe that the same unpopularity of the current regime along with belarusian nationalism will prevent any moves towards a union state.
The idea kinda soured with Putin's rise to power, but the treaty's still around and Putin's been using it and the increasingly unstable situation in Belarus to leverage Lukashenko into signing away more and more sovereignty to Russia.
The negotiations started and agreements were signed in preparation for a Union State between Russia and Belarus in the 1990s, well before Putin came to power.
tl;dr: Back in the 90s Russia and Belarus tentatively agreed to a long-term goal of unification. At this point Belarus was actually in a better position economically than Russia and Lukashenko figured he stood to eventually become leader of this theoretical post-Soviet union.
