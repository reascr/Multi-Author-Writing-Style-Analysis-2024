You're fine. If you can invade Russia, even do that because I don't see Russia getting the message otherwise. The only acceptable conclusion is the repatriation of all Ukraine lands and peoples and Russia making reparations and not interfering in Ukraine politics. Maybe nukes should also be returned to Ukraine is the only point of negotiation.
They asked for a ceasefire, Ukraine declinedâ€¦ I see no problem here. Fucked around and found out. You canâ€™t respect a ceasefire that only you agreed to ðŸ¤£ I mean, you CAN, itâ€™s just not intelligent.
You can't just say you're respecting a ceasefire that do snt exist then try to blame the other guys for continuing to fight. The Kremlin is full of morons.
This is what Russian state propaganda tells people. Well, it's one of their many narratives. Russia can do no fault, they've always only defended themselves from nazis.
If you don't get input from anywhere else, this is what you believe and it's a hard sell for many that the reverse is the truth when it's so much easier to go with the flow than to fight the system.
Sheep buys the propaganda. Smart people leaves the country. Brave people fights the system. Finally you have the 'silent majority' who realizes that a lot of things are wrong but they can't leave so they nod and pretend it's raining.
