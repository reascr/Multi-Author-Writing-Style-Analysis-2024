I mean the chinese economy is not at all like the russian one in which you can cut loose and expect zero blowback. Its in neither the west or chinas interest to engage in a trade war, especially right now.
Their supporting them with morphine and clothes, massive difference between that and tanks, drones, and laser guided weaponry. If china really wanted to see Russia win or make progress, they definitely could be doing a lot more, and unlike Iran or North Korea, some of the weapons they have could potentially make a serious difference against Ukraine.
"While China has provided some help to Russia, including parroting Russian disinformation campaigns about the war and promoting Russian false pretexts about the war...".
What's crazy to me is how governmental institutions spent a decade building a narrative to justify war with Russia. The 2016 Russian election interference narrative was almost completely false. Then the years spent rehabbing Ukraine's image certainly makes it seem that there were factions who were waiting for the moment to engage in war with Russia.
When you start treating them like an enemy, they would start supplying Russia with soldiers and weapons. Do you want that?
Industrial espionage is the norm not the exception. Show me any countries that were able to industrialize without industrial espionage or technology transfer.
