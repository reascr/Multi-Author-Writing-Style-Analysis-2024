As an ex service member…we took all kinds of vaccines so we could do our job and be combat ready. If you are afraid of vaccines…you’re not fit for the military.
Thank god the people who don’t get the vaccine, and we’re planning to join the military, have a back up plan.
People in the military get so many vaccines. Way more than civilians. If not wanting vaccines is an issue, def don't join the military lol. They vaccinate for things you've never ever heard of.
While I am fully vaccinated, I can both still get and still infect someone. None of the information we were told has turned out to be true. I'm holding off on another booster.
It was never hailed as a 100% fix. Flu vaccines work just like the COVID one. They have to guess what strains you might encounter and produce a vaccine for it. If you come on contact with a different stain, you can still get it.
The vaccines were rushed...trials were skipped in favor of mini trials. That is why we are just now finding out there are side affects like heart issues in some teen males.
