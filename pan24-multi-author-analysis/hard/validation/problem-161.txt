Shit happens when you're trigger happy. Not excusing it, but I see absolutely no reason for Russia to "attack" Poland, especially some farm with no strategic value. Also why the hell would Russia want to invade Poland?
Ok, so maybe Poland does have value to Russia BUT as you said, it would mean a war with NATO and I don't think it's that valuable to Russia, like at all.
Having that in mind it seems that NATO is backpedaling leaving Poland vulnerable - it reminds Poles situation from September 1939, don't you think?
Our armies attacked Poland on 1st of September, Polish Allies - UK and France declared war on us on 3rd of September and... just it.
It is unlikely to be fired by Ukrainians as their AA batteries aim EASTwards not west-wards as anti rocketry system does isn't build for chasing rockets but for colliding with them midair.
If it's a Ukrainian missile it may have been trying to shoot down a Russian missile heading west and has missed meaning the Ukrainian missile could have been chasing it but missed and kept going west /north west to Poland. Or it's a Russian missile that has over shot Ukraine. All guessing of cause. I don't see it being deliberate but who knows these days.
