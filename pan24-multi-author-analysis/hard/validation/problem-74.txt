What are our shoulder launched anti-air weapons for? Destroying Russian helicopters. What are they doing? Destroying Russian helicopters.
Yes… the US is running out of the old weapons we are willing to send to Ukraine. Not really a big surprise since we don’t mass produce them since they are essentially obsolete to our armed forces.
The U.S. Military no longer has to consider how to maintain and dispose of old weapons. (At least for a bit.).
Former Soviet Bloc nations are soon to become customers of U.S. arms manufacturers - if not for new purchases, then at least for maintenance contracts on the surplus equipment they’re being given.
That makes it pretty clear that, despite not drawing on stockpiles intended directly for US military use, they do still intend to "replenish US inventories" that are being drawn down to supply Ukraine.
Just a reminder here are 2,000 Bradley IFVs in storage (which could have been sent months ago), which would be a massive upgrade to Ukrainian mechanized forces and much better than sending Soviet-built tanks that have built-in turret-launching bulleyes or crappy BMPs. Just because the Ukrainians know how to use them doesn't mean it's the best option, sending Bradleys is the much better option.
Exactly. I 100% agree. I very strongly support sending ATACMS to Ukraine, this is literally the perfect war for them. In most wars, the USAF would have bombed all the high-value targets long before the Army gets to them. ATACMS has a "measly" 190 mile range, while the USAF was sending B-52 bombers from the continental US to bomb targets in Iraq and then flying them back home. Even Tomahawk cruise missiles have a 1,000+ mile range. The Ukrainians already know how to use HIMARS and M270 GMLRS too. If we don't send them, then it was a waste of money making them if they never get used and just collect dust in a warehouse somewhere, plus it would be supporting the freedom of an underdog nation. Lastly, ATACMS is going to be retired and replaced by Precision Strike Missile anyway. Better they be used to support a worthy cause than destroyed because the whole system simply got retired.
