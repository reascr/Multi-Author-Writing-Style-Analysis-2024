>Holding cops who have been found guilty of misconduct accountable is an issue several states have tried to address head-on. States like California, Virginia, and Massachusetts have passed laws allowing them to decertify an officer, essentially ensuring that their record of bad behavior follows them if they try to find a job in law enforcement elsewhere in the country.
This approvals step requires that it is proven that the crime is related to their work as a police officer, and that it is either "gravely injurious to the interests of the State", or "liable to lead to serious loss of confidence in the public service" i.e. even very serious crimes unrelated to their work won't result in a pension being forfeit.
As for the moral argument around whether this is a slippery slope with respect to 401k's etc., I'd ask the question of how this is any different from a fine payable over many years? It is still a financial penalty relating to a crime you have been sentenced for.
well the issue is convicted criminals on duty. If i committed a crime outside of my work purview then I would still get a pension but if I did it related to my work, then I wouldn't.
They should get the money they paid in and any interest generated but they should lose out on the pension.
These people paid into their pension system, and may not deserve it but it was their money. Instead of just taking a pension, if a crime has been committed and a victim identified restitution is a better play in my opinion. pensions should be protected FULL STOP.
