Everyone in this thread is focused on Finland, but the order also increases the military to 1.5M active duty. They currently have 1M, so this is increasing their active duty by 50%. There's little reason to think Russia can afford to do this or that the troops will be adequately trained/supplied. I think this is much less likely than a few bases on the Finish border.
Russia currently has a population of 147M. That means they plan on having 1 out of every hundred citizens being active military. If they're mostly men, that's one out of 50. Subtract the men under 16 and over 60, and you're probably talking one out of every 25.
My rough estimate is the numbers required for his goal would be 5% of appropriately aged males. So sure he does, if he goes to a total war footing and the people donâ€™t have an impromptu defenestration.
Yeah, but doing so and performing this badly and then trying it on a nato applicant about to get the approval and who already has security assurances would be epically stupid.
