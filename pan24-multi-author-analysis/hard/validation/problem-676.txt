They are pulling their weight by providing funding, himars, ammunition and supplies. Though that is the least amount of work when the need of the hour is MBT’s.
I have seen this argument several times. But big strong America could surely be able to provide all the necessary logisitics to support ally ukraine.
I would hope that the US could push the Abrams to those countries that give up tanks to Ukraine. In fact, I would hope we provide a substantial discount to make that happen.
On the other hand, the Leopard plugs very easily into the existing structures they have, probably because Germany designed it for a number of diverse situations.
The Abrams is designed to exist within US logistical doctrines that allow it to be properly maintained and supplied. Ukraine’s logistics are based on Soviet doctrine that’s effective for the T-72. Ukraine would need to redesign the way it handles tanks from the ground up to incorporate the Abrams. If this were peace time that’s not a big deal, but there’s a war of survival going on.
