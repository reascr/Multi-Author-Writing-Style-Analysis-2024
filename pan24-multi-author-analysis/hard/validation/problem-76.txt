The sensor on the missile itself is designed to go into bulldog mode against fast movers to turn slowly. Laser guided missiles would’ve been the way to go with the balloon.
Talking with one of the air crews in charge of one of the balloons recent shootdowns, they're firing sidewinders that have no warhead, just the missile.
1) I literally stated that I talked with one of the airman/men responsible for the shootdown. The AiM-9X that was launched on multiple occasions are not armed. They are dud headed heaters that impacted the balloon and caused it to rupture and decompress.
2) Why would you not want to destroy the balloon, rendering whatever it is it's carrying to shreds? Maybe... just maybe... it's because we'd like to collect and examine the contents of the balloon.
In case I have missed it has anyone said if they've determined exactly what the nature of these balloons are? I know China said the first one was meteorological, but I don't think anyone is taking their word for it. Now that it has been shot down and retrieved, as well as a few others, have they been able to determine exactly what these balloons were doing?
do we have actual concrete proof they are spy balloons yet? every report doesn’t mention specifics in terms of sensors, data, or sensitive electronics.
