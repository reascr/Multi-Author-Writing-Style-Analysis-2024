I understand the circus part of her quote but even though McCarthy is from Bakersfield he’s delivering little to no bread to the common man.
Exactly. McCarthy and Company just proposed a flat 30% sales tax and rescinding income taxes for the rich and corporations. They aren’t handing out bread to placate the masses, they want to make it cost 30% more.
Yeah, McCarthy won 2/3 of the 1/3 of folks that bothered to vote in a district that wouldn’t be red if California hadn’t unilaterally disarmed from political gerrymandering.
One of McCarthy's problems (of which there are several ...) is that while there are about 20 members of his conference from the "nut wing" of the GOP, there are plenty more "moderates" than that (plus some not-so-moderate ones that actually interpreted the 2022 mid-term elections properly, and understand that the voters are sick of the hyper-partisanship that the GOP engages in).
If the Democrats thought McCarthy could be a decent Speaker, they would have negotiated with him (and he with them) rather than forcing him to give a ton of concessions to the most MAGA wing of the Republican party to get the position.
They could, but McCarthy is also from the wing-nut side of the Republican caucus, so unless he suddenly decided to become a moderate, the best outcome is his speakership fails quickly, and some moderate Republicans work with the Democrats to put one of the moderate Republicans in the Speaker position, and then work together on whatever their bipartisan coalition can actually agree on.
