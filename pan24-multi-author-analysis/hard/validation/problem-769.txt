serious question: are russians able to access popular social media platforms like reddit, twitter, etc.? I just wonder if the average russian citizen knows how widely despised their government is.
My comment was directed more to your remark about how you Russians are 'despised' following the invasion. I'm of course not saying you should pick a side, that's up to you, but it is difficult to be an "enlighted centrist" in a highly internationally condemned invasion. And no, there are no "winners" here, but one part loses the most, and another the least. Shades of grey, as you say.
Dude, if your country performs the largest invasion in Europe since WWII, and is responsible for numerous atrocities in that country, as well as threatening with the destruction of humanity each time they experience a setback on the battlefield, it is only natural that your country will get criticism. And sadly, that means normal citizens will also sometimes have to endure criticism or even hate.
It's human nature, and you just have to deal with it and distance yourself from the atrocities your government commits. Otherwise, people will assume you are complicit, or at the very least, have nothing against the annexations, the massacre at Bucha, the missile attacks on civillian infrastructure, etc. This Russian victim-mentality I've seen a lot of places doesn't give you sympathy, it just makes you look apathetic and indifferent towards the actions of your countrymen.
