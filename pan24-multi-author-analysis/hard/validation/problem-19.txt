Everyone got something in the omnibus,that's why it got passed so overwhelmingly in the senate. If Bernie was the president, I would imagine his agendas would be too progressive and uncompromising to have success Biden has had. Plus, Biden and McConnell are friends and that helps.
Biden really was the right man for the job. Sure, he's old. And gaffe prone. But he knows how the system is supposed to work. Trump and his cronies smashed the system like a toddler smashes a Lego house. And there wasn't anyone more qualified then Biden to put it back together.
Despite the Republicans best efforts, the federal government is functioning again. Biden deserves far more credit than he'll ever get for pulling things back from the brink.
Biden was able to do more with less in 1 year than Trump was able to do in 4. I very much want to see Biden step down in 2024, but I think it is pretty irrefutable that Biden was the man for the job.
Biden is a president. Trump is a wannabe mafioso grifter. One has qualities that can be discoursed, but generally agreed upon. The other belongs has no redeeming qualities.
