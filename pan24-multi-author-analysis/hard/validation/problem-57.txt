China is by far the largest polluter on Earth. They have 5x as many coal fire power plants than the next closest country (India) with plans to open a few hundred more in ‘23.
Oh I was previously unaware that global warming and climate change or whatever the new terminology is gives two fucks about per capita numbers.
Beyond that they remain the largest polluter and it’s cute no one bothered to address their 1200+ coal fire power plants.
‘Guys It’s totally cool that China is the biggest polluter and largest contributor to climate change because their per capita numbers are a pinch lower than the rest of the civilized world’.
China is the worlds largest carbon emissions emitter TODAY, historically the US has emitted over 20% of it making it the top contributor. The emissions china puts out today aren’t warming the climate as much as the gas USA put out over 200+ years has. Yeah china needs to cut emissions but it isn’t the only (or even biggest) reason it’s getting hot here. Also didn’t USA move like all of its manufacturing over there? Easy to export emissions then blame the import country lol.
