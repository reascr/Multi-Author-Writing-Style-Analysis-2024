The earth's population was 2.85 billion when I was born; I'll be 60 next year. In other words, the world's population has nearly tripled in the last 60 years (2.8x), but even with the green revolution, the amount of arable land, water, minerals, etc has not tripled in that time. We're in for interesting times even if the rate of population growth continues to slow, because it's over a larger base every year...
The earth can support more people if we used resources more wisely, but our population growth is beginning to slow down because we aren’t meeting replacement “goals.”.
Part of the increasing global population is due to increased life expectancy, not just birth rates, and the increase due to life expectancy doesn't compound in the same way.
I don't know if it is a positive or not however you look at it but currently birth rates are in decline in many countries with the median average age increasing.
It's going to be an interesting few decades as so much of the economic growth and lifestyle we have enjoyed is tied to the population increasing (which obviously cannot happen forever). It looks like that M.I.T study of world wide decline in 2040 probably isn't too far off if we keep at it.
