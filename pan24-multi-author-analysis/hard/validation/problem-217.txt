Im ok with Democrats reaching out to some moderate Republicans to gain their votes via favors and concessions to get a democrat to the speaker position.
So... not saying that the House Republicans are alpha strategists, but what if they are willing to let Jeffries be the Speaker just so that the GOP, who are still in the majority, can clog everything up and blame the Democrats for all of the stalemates?
If you can't rally your members to vote for you to take the speaker of the house, then you are going have a hard time negotiating with your members and the democrats.
So, to the holdouts case, they can either have no power under the GOP, or no power under a Dem leader who will not have a majority to pass anything and they can deflect onto him being unable to get things done.
If they end up giving Jeffries the gavel, he'll have it worse than McCarthy; They don't have to vote with him just because they caused him to be Speaker.
If McCarthy won't give them committee assignments, then they're not going to have them under Jeffries either.
