1. Primary targets are substations that power military installations, not generation, so unless civilians are on the same grid, they're mostly not affected (grid failure due to suddenly lost of load on the system triggering safety shutdowns not withstanding).
There's really no "military infrastructure" in relation to Ukraine war on Moscow. Hitting Belgorod? Yes, and Ukraine had been doing that. There's really no reason to hit Moscow unless you intend to take out Kremlin.
I am not sure why you took my comment as hitting Moscow. There is infrastructure critical for the Russian military to function. Take those out. School buildings are not critical infrastructure.
But more importantly, cutting off Russian supply lines originating in Russia is more important for Ukraine.
Striking targets inside Russia can be defensive as well. Ukrainian troops need not cross the border. But they can use long range weapons to take out missile batteries and other critical military infrastructure.
Because the US supplied the long range weapons with strings attached... no strikes inside Russia using their weapons, for fear of escalating the conflict.
As the article said, "draw a line in the sand so to speak and tell Russia if they import and use Iranian SRBMs, the U.S. would supply Ukraine with ATACMS.".
