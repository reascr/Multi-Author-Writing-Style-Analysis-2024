I can get betting against Ukraine back in February 2022. But I'd hope people would have reassessed the situation and their mindset by now, after all that's happened and not happened.
But then three days passed and Kyiv still stood free. And then a week. Two weeks. A month. And then the Russians were retreating from that entire front. And then the Ukrainians pushed Russians back on two more fronts too.
But still pushing south from Russia to kyiv would still be a difficult task. It failed at the beginning of the war. Now Ukraine is more experienced and equipped.
Nah, I listen to pro-Ukrainian sources and its not looking good for Ukraine. As much as I want Russia to lose this conflict is not over yet and could drag on a very long time.
Russia has lost other wars, there's no reason to think they can't lose this war. Whether they want to or whether they decide to stop, has little to do with it.
Ukraine will become a member of NATO and arm themselves beyond what we've seen from any other nation. They'll erect defences between them and the Russian border that'll stand for more that 100 years.
