There’s no excuse for them other than the dems are outnumbered at the polls. I live in Ohio and the state of politics here is simply awful. But there’s still plenty of dems and non-idiot voters in Ohio. Admittedly, there also a ton of idiot democrats that didn’t show up to vote this past election. If those people freaking showed up, we might not have DeWine or Vance.
Can we please not paint all “these people” with the same brush? A friendly reminder that Ohio is gerrymandered to hell and there’s many democrats in this region too.
That part of Ohio is by Youngstown, it was big time democrat country for as long as I can remember, until recently. You’re not finding people opposed to infrastructure out there. Weak.
I realize that the person I’m responding to is being a jerk. He is blaming the people of east palestine for this, by assuming they vote this way or that. When really it’s union country.
Wtf are you talking about? There is no evidence this has anything to do with an infrastructure problem. It’s an Ohio town that has a railroad going through it, there’s towns like this all over the USA.
