From anecdotes I've read on /r/army and various other military subs over the years, apparently the Soviet and then Russian military did not train at all the same way that NATO and other Western militaries did. Instead of combined arms training where various elements like infantry, armor, artillery, and aviation train together, the Russians chose to train each element separately and without integrating each other into training/planning. Like each branch behaved in a way where they thought each was the key to winning a fight or was the most important.
Though their training apparently wasn't that great in the first place owing to a reliance on conscripts. When a Marshal of the Soviet Union came to the US during the Cold War on a military exchange where we sent one of our own high-ranking military officers to the USSR, the US demonstrated one of our OPFOR units to them. Using the same tactics that the Soviets published in their own manuals and info gathered from wherever we could find it. He remarked that this was the first time he'd seen a rifle motor brigade operated perfectly to their own doctrine, despite it being American unit standing before him.
It's likely a big reason why their VDV and air assaults failed. There was little to no combined arms training with regular infantry, armor support, or CAS and aerial resupply.
The issue with them is that either their tanks are by and large low quality.or they use them by themselves without proper infantry support.
Sure the Bradley killed a lot of armored vehicles in Iraq, but The Iraqis didn't have masses of artillery though. The Bradley is still a lot more squishy than a tank on today's battlefield.
A smaller number of tanks . Ifvs and infantry combined . Can defeat a larger force if its just tanks with not enough infantry.
Oddly enough the country using human wave tactics isn't using enough troops when it comes to using their tanks.
