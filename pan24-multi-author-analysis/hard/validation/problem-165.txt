Nah, it was never about actually criticising the cozy relationships between gaming journalism and the game industry. That was all BS, the gamergaters never cared about a studio bribing journalists for AAA games, or for blacklisting people for negative coverage and the like - not unless it invovled something they hated anyway.
While gamergate may have started off as a criticism of video games journalism and the good old boys club of AAA gaming, I do think that Rumblings of the sorts of harassment campaigns occurred with Anita Sarkeesian far before that. That said, I don't think that you are far off by suggesting that video game fans from both the left and the right ended up glomming onto it because they saw some form of benefit in the burgeoning attention economy. It was a distraction and a politicization of popular culture that was used to create an almost Lifestyle brand out of identitarian Politics on both sides of the aisle and I think that ultimately has been bad for any form of nuanced conversation about politics or governments.
And then there was the Cambridge analytica scandal in which he was specifically targeting people with dark Triad psychological traits on Facebook with targeted misinformation and rage bait.
Making sure that it was grammatically correct, even if it was a little awkward without commas, was the hardest part; I wanted to make sure that people recognize that I am inferring not only correlation but also a coordinated causation.
Trump, Bannon, Jones, Limbaugh and others like them recognized the power that can come from turning our political Arena and government into a reality TV show designed to outrage those on both sides of the aisle.
Honestly, I ended up stepping away from The Gaming Community for a few years while that was ongoing and I'm glad I did.
