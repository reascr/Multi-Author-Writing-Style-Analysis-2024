The support for Putin's Russia in Germany comes mainly from three groups: Russian immigrants, Far-right idiots and a few far-left idiots who have not quite caught on that Russia is no longer communist and NATO are the good guys this time.
Its a lot of people age 50+ who seem to have forgotten how bad they felt living in the former DDR (east german region formerly controled by russia) which tend to support Russia/Putin in this conflict and who refuse to believe in most of the atrocities the russian army has committed in ukraine.
Oh and the same people (for some reason) also are super susceptible to Fake News, Russian Propaganda and Conspiracy Sh\t ... not only regarding the war in ukraine.
The only time I've seen that 14000 number is from lying dumbasses trying to spread disproven Russian propaganda. Maybe you are talking about something different though, so very clearly and with sources why don't you explain that.
They invaded in 2014. You really trying to make the idiotic claim that the unkranian government was the only entity going around killing people at that time and that they decided to kill 4400 of their own forces? You are either one of the dumbest people ever or you are one of the most evil. Simping for Russia when Russia started all of this.
What does one do with those who have more allegiance to Russia than the country they live in? Revoke their citizenship and deport them to Russia? Why live in Germany, or Ukraine, or wherever instead of Russia? These people have a pathway to citizen in Russia.
