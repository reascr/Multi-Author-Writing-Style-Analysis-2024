Republicans are slimey and will try to pass some variation of a law that doesn't explicitly say "you must be 21 to vote", but will try to put in some kind of rule or something that seriously restricts anyone under 21 from voting.
Itâ€™s amazing the efforts these pieces of crap will go through to restrict people from voting instead of creating any legislation that would make people want to vote for them.
There would be no way to write a law that would be able to frustrate voting because someone is 18. It would either be overly broad, or vague, both of which fail. While I am a newly minted lawyer, I assure you it is impossible to skirt around this particular amendment. It would be the same as trying to get around the amendment that allows for a direct vote of senators. How would you even do that?
The constitution provides for states the power to set criteria of who can vote(within the bounds of the constitution) but also allows congress certain powers to change things regarding federal regulations.
They are pushing for a definition of a clause in the Constitution that allows states all the power while ignoring the 2nd half of the clause that says Congress can overrule them.
They are pushing for the GOP Supreme Court to push a reading of Article 1, Section 4, Clause 1 that somehow eliminates the 2nd half of the clause.
