I have no idea why, but last night I dreamed I went to Boston and was walking through the city thinking how European it looked and that the Reddit commenter was right after all. Just thought I'd let you know.
We're talking about medicine with regard to shrooms. Like marijuana before the recent recreational legalization, it has actual medical applications that are well supported. I don't know why you'd think they're legalizing recreational use based on this article, I can only assume you didn't bother reading it. This is about coverage for medical applications. I guess you're American so imagine it's health insurance but administered by the province, that's what we're talking about.
I can see what you mean in these pics (first link) but I guess I just wasn't in the right neighborhoods? I was visiting a friend and what I saw just looked typical American. Second and third link pix look American style to me. Granted it looks nice compared to other American cities I've been to but I don't remember ever thinking it looked European.
Wtf are you talking about Boston looks very different from typical North American cities. Look at these pictures and tell me this doesnâ€™t look European.
