I mean just the feed for animals measured in land is 80% of agriculture. Thats the barley, oats, soy and hay and other grains used in animal feed (for farm animals, so not including cat and dog feed which is mostly meat from those industries).
We fed the animals with barley, oats and hay only in the winter on my grandfather's farm, as grasses we ground them with corn to make nutritious fodder for the cold days. In industrial farms, it is only with mixtures of corn and soy, and as far as I understand animal and fish scraps processed as protein powder, for faster mass gain. I mean agriculture and animal husbandry can be sustainable. But the biggest polluters are industrial farms with the entire production and feeding chain. If they stop, will farmer John with 100 sheep and a few cows selling his produce to the local restaurant be a big polluter.
But this 80% must also include the mega industrial farms that probably also hold the fields where the crops are grown for animal feed. Probably cheap and at the expense of some ecosystem.
