I don't know why you guys can't accept basic facts. You are so intent on being the victim of something here and it's not the case. I don't know what to tell you - the rules are simple but keep stomping your foot I guess?
edit: Gonna add that I got banned from /r/Conservative for asking a simple question. Just stop with this fake outrage - it's embarrassing.
It’s not outrage. I explained why after reading the rules I disagree with the mod, and why it doesn’t surprise me. They can interpret it however they want though, it’s their sub.
No, she has no way to know if it’s a transgender “woman” or some guy creeping in to see her naked. The frightening part is wondering if she’s being peeped on or worse.
You expect to see a cis woman in a woman’s locker room. Now you’re just being obtuse if you think that’s a valid argument for letting men into women’s locker rooms. Just because you have no problem getting nude in front of or being around nude people of the opposite sex doesn’t mean it’s the norm, nor should it be.
The fact that I have to try to convince someone that a naked man shouldn’t be strolling around in front of minor girls is just absurd.
How is a 17 year old supposed to be able to tell a naked transgender “woman” from a naked man? I’d say she has a pretty good right to be freaked out about that as she’s stepping out of the shower herself.
