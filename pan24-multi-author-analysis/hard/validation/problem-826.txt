So one of the interesting side-effects of the war in Ukraine is that it has shone a light on just how deeply corruption is established in the various Russian military arms and just how poor their equipment readiness is.
One of the biggest reasons Russia has poorly maintained conventional forces is because they have spent billions in updating their nuclear arsenal, Russia knows they would never be able to win a conventional war with NATO so why would funnel money and resources into it?
Russia on average spends 15-17% of their defense budget on nuclear weapons, one of the reasons their conventional forces are so neglected, they could never compete with nato conventionally, they know this, so why waste money on it.
One of the big reasons Russias army is in shambles is because Russia spends much more on updating and maintaing their nuclear forces, Russia knows it wouldn't be able to fight a conventional war against NATO, even if they did pour a ton of money into their army/conventional forces, they would get squashed, So they spend their defense budget on the only thing that they CAN go toe to toe with NATO on, and that's Nuclear weapons.
Sure nobody wants Russia to be capable of causing a massive devastating / country ending nuclear strike but unfortunately they do have that capability if they didn't, I can guarantee you that NATO would have put a stop to this a long time ago.
That's not to say that can't fail, too, but Putin definitely understands it, and while he might want to test the boundaries, I seriously doubt he actually wants to be the guy to cause all out nuclear war.
However, use of a nuke on Ukraine means there is a nuclear-armed regime that is willing to use them in pursuit of conquest, rather than as a deterrent, and that's a major red line.
TL;DR NATO Article 5 is not a necessary condition for a devastating US response if Russia uses nukes in Ukraine. But such a Russian attack could trigger NATO article 5 anyway if radiation from Russian aggression drifts across the border into any NATO country.
Now if Russia attempts a general nuclear strike, that WILL trigger Article 5, and I'd expect Russia to pay in kind for every successful detonation. If a warhead detonates in a suburb of Paris... well then the French will ensure Moscow rides the whirlwind (they will have to).
