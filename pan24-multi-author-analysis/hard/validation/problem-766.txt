For a year or two, 5 max, and then, in accordance with Russian historical tradition "and then it got worse.".
Oh come on. As much as I hate Yanukovich as a Ukrainian you can't compare the two in Russia ball-licking exercise.
There was no Russian military in Ukraine under him let alone attacking other countries. And EU association deal was moving somewhat forward. Really until his corrupt power become seriously endangered, he tried to stay away from Russian influence.
As a human and politician overall, he's a much bigger piece of shit than even Lukashenko, but he was miles away from him in terms of deepthroating Putin.
Yanukovich wasn't even in the same league. Or even the league below. He's a fly on the windshield of a car driven by Lukashenko sticking his tongue out of the window going right into Putin's asshole.
Nah, Yanukovych was a total "Yes man" to his master, Lukashynka is a sleezzy and slippery bastard. He retained power by inviting russian troops to the country back in 2020, and those troops are getting smaller with each day. He saw early into war that the horse he bid on is not going to win, so he's using every excuse to not send Belarusian army to the front. After war ends, he'll point out that fact and tell some bs that he had no choice. As for Belarusians, the time is not ripe yet for an uprising, but they should up their partisan game for sure.
