Firstly, you mean NATO. Ukraine has always been part of the UN, even when it was part of the Soviet Union.
Thirdly, even if Ukraine was joining NATO, it is a wholly illogical reason for Russia to invade the country. NATO is a defensive alliance that deters Russian invasions. By this very logic: Russia only has invaded Ukraine to ensure that it can maintain potential control over the country, and not lose the ability to invade at a later date.
In every way you look at it, Russia’s NATO expansion excuse only makes sense if you interpret it as “We have wanted to control Ukraine and we only invaded because we were afraid we would lose our ability to do so.”.
Didn't Ukraine want that for themselves after previous Russian aggression, including annexing Crimea several years earlier? Russia has been a threat to Ukraine for some time, especially after moving to a democracy very recently, with Russia having a fear it would be successful and hurt the influence Russia has on the region, and especially what Russians would think about a successful democracy in their neighbor. The US may have supported their joining the UN, and ultimately NATO, but the reasons for Ukraine to do so are entirely based upon Russian aggression. Even the primary reason for the US to really get involved, beyond the humanitarian reasons, is because Russian has actively been working on undermining democracies in the western world.
