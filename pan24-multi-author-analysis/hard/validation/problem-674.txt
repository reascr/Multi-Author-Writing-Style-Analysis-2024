Why do you assume this? There's no logic to how FIFA works, this has been shown over and over again - money talks. They don't care about human rights, morals, ethics etc. those in charge in FIFA want to fill their pockets.
Yeah, FIFA alongside FIA can choke on their money. But really, dont expect much from teams, time for gestures is long overdue, you either take the chance to be remembered as an athlete who won World Cup, or as a mediocre activist who didnt really achive more than making a gesture.
Yeah, just shit all over your entire life effort to wear an armband that will do nothing more than make FIFA and Qatar angry and will get you expelled, can see a dude who didnt ever put his effort to achieve anything meaningful.
Bingo baby, most people here wouldn’t even know the world cup is happening this year if it wasnt for the qatari fuck ups that most football fans genuinely dont care about because they have bigger problems to worry about than rainbow armbands being banned.
You can adress it lol im just saying calling for boycotts is a little extreme, you have free speech say what you want bro its all good, its just my opinion that i have list of priorities rn and rainbow armbands doesn’t rank very high, because i expect most normal functioning people to still respect eachother regardless of rainbow armbands being approved or not by some rich fuck at fifa.
Brother, I guarantee you, there are much much bigger issues happening right now that need your attention and your wallet, hell, issues that are happening in qatar right now as well, that dont include rainbow armbands.
What ethics? The ethics of the organizers? You mean to tell me that just becauseyou didnt wear the armband means you agree with his actions? This is surface level judgement on people who probably trained their whole careers for this event.
Exactly, redditors in an outrage over shit they give 0 fucks about is commonplace and it’s so stupid, they just have to give their two cents in before calling to boycott or some other carelessly extreme measure likely to cause massive amounts of damage lol.
