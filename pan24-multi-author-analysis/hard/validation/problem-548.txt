When will the africans apologize for selling all their own race off? The tribes would sell of slaves (Spoils of war) for guns, food, etc. Since currency wasn't a huge thing there.
Because there wasn't any, countries at the time. More large tribal and nomadic of the African continent. But these tribes traded away most of their slaves (spoils of war) to Europeans for weapons, food and other luxuries.
So sorry that they’ll find a way to turn some of those riches into reparations for the survivors of those whose lives were stolen during the slave trade?
It a good thing that apologies are being made, slavery is an unethical, immoral and evil practice that dehumanises people to tools/ cattle. The fact that slavery excised under law in the Dutch colonies demands an apology and quite some inward reflection about our history. However….
Should the ethnical Dutch descendants of poor farm- and factory labourers pay for the colonial crimes of an elitist part of their society?
When will white people stop deflecting when other people push colonizing nations to make amends for the injustices they perpetuated? Some Africans participated in the slave trade, yes, but by no means was it all African peoples. Some Africans actively fought it. The Christian king of Kongo even petitioned a European power to end it. Not to mention, I don’t think any of the enslaved people were fond of the institution. Nor were their descendants. On top of all this, let’s remember who it was that maintained slavery over the centuries and who “refined” it into a particularly brutal and race-based caste system. It wasn’t Africans, who were also brutally colonized and genocided, but white people. So let’s stop repeating these racist gotchas, and move towards a more equitable and just world together.
So you think Africans and the African diaspora are better off today after centuries of enslavement, racial profiling, redlining, lynching, race riots, economic extraction, and so forth than if slavery never occurred, Africa was never colonized, and Black people developed according to their own terms? I’m sorry but that’s hard to believe, and I’m afraid most other people of African descent do not feel the same.
But even if it somehow did end up better for Africans, that still doesn’t make white people’s actions justified or any less deserving of apology. That’s like if someone took a bullet for you and saved your life and you said to their family, “Stop crying over them, cuz at least I’m alive.” Like, yeah, it’s cool that they saved your life, but the fact the other person is dead is still a tragedy and the shooter needs to be reprimanded.
