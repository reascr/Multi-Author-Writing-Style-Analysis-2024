That’s crazy I will say that at least you have a public transportation system, we only have busses in major cities the biggest have limited rapid trains - very limited. If I want to go to to a city 6-7 hours away from where I live I have to drive, there is no transit of any kind that will take me there, possibly I could fly IF that city has an airport…. We did have greyhound bus lines which you could buy a ticket to drive between city’s on but they were a private company that shut down.
We have a large country with a small population so public transportation is not good, there are so many places even in the city that you can’t even catch a bus. A monthly transit pass in Edmonton is $100. I live in a suburb of Edmonton you can get a bus into Edmonton from one area of my town a few times a day but it’s not practical and costly.
Before with standard fuel prices it cost me $180, so $20 less than the train fares, and I still had to pay for petrol to get to the train since buses don’t operate early enough to get me there in the morning.
Yes there is wear and tear on my car, I have a 120km round trip commute. It costs me about $240 a month for fuel with the high prices as they are now.
I thought this was amazing, and that australia needs to get in on something like that again. Except for the recent fuel inflation, it was cheaper to drive to work than catch the train.
