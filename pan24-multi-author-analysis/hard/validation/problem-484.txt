"October 10, 1952, Harry Truman said this: Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years.".
Here’s the thing. It was already an unconditional surrender except for one minor detail. Immunity for Hirohito, as I had already mentioned. Which he already got. History just doesn’t line up with this view that it was necessary. There is to show what I said.
Honestly, I think it’s pretty clear and I err on the side of MacArthur on this one. I do understand the fog of war and why Truman chose to do what he did. That is not without doubt. But I also do think someone with more foresight, which Truman sorely lacked, would have seen how unnecessary it was in the end.
Truman was a decent enough small man put into an office he wasn't prepared for and he didn't destroy the world. But also he exemplified the qualities of what the Commander in Chief should be: a civilian. There's good reason to have the military command under the power and subject to civilian authority.
