New Year's is the most important family holiday of the year in both Ukraine and Russia. Christmas was banned in the early days of the Soviet Union, and then secular Christmas traditions (the tree, gifts, songs and carols, large family meals, etc.) were moved to New Year's. In terms of social importance, it's equivalent to Christmas in Western Europe, the US, and other places that follow that tradition.
So while there's no cease fire rule, and it would be silly to expect any level of decency from Russia in this, it's still yet another particular evil.
And please, save yourself the trouble of "explaining" to me that terror-bombing, innocent-civilian-killing Russia bad. The difference in military eligibility of targets on either side, or the ethicality of either, are not in question for me, but are, as I said, not relevant for my point.
Human beings are killed by both sides on a holiday. Which is the only relevant part if the accusation is specifically about a lack of "Christian values" on one side - and therefore perfectly comparable. Or is "thou shalt not kill" conditional on what passport you carry, or what uniform you wear?
Zelensky can rightfully blame for Russia attacking, and especially attacking civilians, in general, on any day.
I'll explain it again: Zelensky condemns Russia performing terror-bombings of Ukrainian civilians on a holiday.
It's a logical fallacy to even try to compare one thing to another - as if Russia bombing civilians on a holiday and Ukraine bombing Russian soldiers on a holiday are even remotely comparable.
If we're talking about logic, though - then yes, I can definitely accuse Russia of killing the civilians - who are not the combatants actively participating in the conflict - at the time of a holiday. Russian soldiers are combatants, civilians are not.
