Don't be mistaken here, Sweden's paltry support for the Syrian Kurds is not a serious security threat to Turkey. Erdogan is just trying to milk the situation for as much political benefit as possible before elections next year.
The YPG isn't Marxist-Leninist and hasn't been for a long time. And I'm sorry, but it is about "the Kurds" to some degree because the central reason the PKK has support is because of discrimination against Kurds in Turkey.
Anyway, many different Kurdish factions fought against Isis, Turkeys issue is with the YPG who they consider a rebrand of the PKK.the same YPG who are now getting closer to Iran and Russia btw.
The leaders of the YPG have participated in PKK activities, they have been trained by and are the result of it.
Interesting, Turkey claims the YPG is just a rebrand of PKK. Some independent groups have also made the same connection.
Ah ok, so Al Qaeda fought against Russia back in the 80’s with the support of USA, so they were considered good guys right? Until they weren’t?
