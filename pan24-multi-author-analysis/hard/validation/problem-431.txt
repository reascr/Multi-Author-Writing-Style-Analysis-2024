I mean, wouldn’t that actually be pretty believable that weather patterns would send balloons off course around the same time? That doesn’t seem implausible at all.
I suppose anything is possible. We live in a very violent universe and we would almost certainly be from the same universe so a alien species capable of interstellar travel but that also has no concept of violence would be highly highly unlikely I would say.
If an alien craft is robust enough for interstellar travel and atmospheric entry/exit at will then I don't think man made explosives are taking it down. This is more spy stuff my peoples.
Also they wouldn't need to enter our airspace to learn how violent humans are therefor an alien craft that does breach our airspace that doesn't anticipate violence from humans would also be highly unlikely I would think.
I mean, if they've done any research on us there's a decent chance they'd know we tend to shoot down unidentified craft due to internal conflict with eachother, and as such that flying around without identifying themselves carries that risk. Do you think aliens would be likely to let other unknown aliens fly around in their space without identifying who they are or what they are doing? I'd assume not.
I doubt it. It would have to be an agency with a CONUS clandestine mission, and there are very few of those, because IIRC it’s not legal to spy domestically. If it was normal, like an experiment of some kind, then FAA would know.
Russia is an interesting possibility, given at least the one in AK is not sophisticated, which tracks with what we know about Russian equipment thanks to Ukraine.
