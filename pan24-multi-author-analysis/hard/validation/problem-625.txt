Having reached center stage Trump attracted a host of enablers and deflectors who ran interference for him in the right wing sphere. Now his political aura is not so potent he is expected to just gracefully fade away. Not going to happen. He will not just go quietly. He will tarnish any Republican opponents who dare to try to elbow him off the stage. Kinda wish he was back on twitter to loudly toxify the whole right wing political process.
Hopefully anger toward the GOP will translate into the 2024 race. Hopefully democrats can do a good job show casing how batshit desantis’s policies and focus are.hopefully trumps infighting damages him enough. And hopefully Moore v Harper doesn’t automatically doom democracy by then anyway.
Yeah it’s a weird and horrifying set of circumstances to consider. DeSantis did well. But he really hasn’t done anything that differently from the rest of the GOP. He’s big on culture war bullshit he literally signed don’t say gay and an anti-“woke” law. He pushed a ton of anti-trans bullshit and so on. And that crap didn’t fly in other states.
Florida is a perfect storm of GOP insanity. Endemic regular GOPers, furious Cuban voters who view everyone left of dick Cheney as Castro, and a never ending tide of boomer retirees. It sucks we are going to have to deal with a deep red Florida until boomers die off because they will have a lot of free electoral votes from it. Floridas gain has bee be the GOP elsewhere loss though.
