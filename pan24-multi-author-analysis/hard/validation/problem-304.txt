The US already spends more per capita on healthcare than a number of countries with better systems. The problem is that a lot of this money ends up in the pockets of shareholders, and isn't used to actually improve public health. There is enough money to give the American people much better healthcare than they currently have without reducing the defence budget.
When will you understand that the military budget is not the reason you don't have healthcare? You are already paying twice as much as the next most expensive country and getting jack shit for it. It's the multibillion dollar insurance corporations and for profit hospitals who are fucking you.
This is highly misleading, because the administrative overhead of insurance companies counts against profits.
Your analysis is HIGHLY biased in favor of insurance companies, because virtually every penny of cost they incur that isn't a payment directly to point of care services is largely useless.
I'm talking about insurance company employees that basically figure out how to deny treatments, pay out less to providers and keep more for themselves, drop costly patients from plans and recruit healthy patients that pay premiums but don't consume as much care, not to mention sales, marketing and advertising to recruit people to particular plans that bear almost no relation to actual quality of care.
