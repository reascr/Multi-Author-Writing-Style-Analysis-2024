The Republicans have been confirming their judges for DECADES, while refusing to confirm Democratic appointees. This really became apparent during the Obama years. And the Democrats just wrung their hands in dismay. So yeah, I guess you're right.
That's your opinion. Whether I agree or not doesn't matter; religion is a big part of the lives of a lot of people, and for that matter, a lot of good people. Many people give to charity because of how they believe; their religion forms the backbone of their moral code. The day we start telling people what beliefs we don't accept as valid we begin the slippery slope to an authoritarian government.
Despite her being in a cultish church, I don't think there's actually much there for her personally though. I don't know of any allegations against her, and she hasn't lied about anything I'm aware of. I don't agree with her positions on things, but beyond that, I don't think there's much of a story.
I think she's pretty clear that she doesn't consider it a settled law. She clearly defined what settled law was and explained why she didn't believe Roe qualified. Late justice Ginsburg expressed similar concerns, and, frankly, if you actually read about Roe, it's a very weird case. There are other cases that actually establish women's rights in respect to abortion much more strongly than Roe. (For example we have several cases here in NC that still serve as precedent in the absence of Roe.).
TIL about NXIVM. I donâ€™t really consider myself misinformed about the news, but I swear I never heard about this. Sadly it was because I was sucked into a post about Brett Kavanaugh. ðŸ˜¡.
