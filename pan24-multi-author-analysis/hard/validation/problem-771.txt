There's a nice video on Youtube by Kraut that talks about this, I'm just summarizing from memory. In a sense the Mongols are to blame. No, really.
This created a power structure where the general population had little power and what it had kept getting siphoned by the rulers, who themselves had one ruler they bow to and in it's grace that they somewhat prosper. When the principality of Moscow finally managed to unite the Russians and drive out the Mongols, it just inherited the power structure and kept propelling it, Russia took many forms and philosophies over the centuries, but the power structure remained through out and it pretty much shapes Russian internal politics.
This is not to shift the blame away from current Russian "leadership" , many centuries has passed since then, but it's also an interesting point to view them through and one which might be key for any future shift in leadership structure over there.
It's interesting that Putin hasn't lined up any obvious successor, but I think you are right, hard to see anyone coming after him who could take over the reigns so firmly. It was different under communism, you had a system in place, this is just one man basically.
