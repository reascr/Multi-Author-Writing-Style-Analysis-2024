One Danish right-wing loonie does something dumb, and now somehow Sweden is attacking Turkey and Islam.
He couldve burned anything else to annoy ErdoÄŸan and not be racist to the immigrants in Sweden. Everyone can get behind his right to free speech. Holding his actions to be equilevant to free speech is wrong however. His motives werent "free speech". Im criticising his actions, not his right to do them. And that false equilevance is quite bothersome. Its how you get away with supporting blatant racism.
People cant support racism but they can support freedom of speech, so thats what he does. Thats how people can support his right to "burn a book". People cant openly say muslim bad and support the dude. But everyone can support freedom of expression.
Because he is an idiot, but even idiots have the freedom of expression and we need to make sure it is possible to preserve it.
It's not wrong to say that it is his right to do as we have freedom of expression in our constitution. His motives doesn't matter.
