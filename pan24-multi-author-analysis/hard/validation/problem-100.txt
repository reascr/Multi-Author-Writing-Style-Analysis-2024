The first one literally had an abbreviation of "Communist Party of China" written on it in Chinese. I mean, yeah, anyone could technically stick that on a balloon, but who would?
True, China publicly claimed that one. Could be Russia or someone realized "wait, they let balloons through their airspace?" and jumped on it. You never know.
but I agree with what you're saying. if they were shooting military planes out of they sky you'd think they'd be grounding civilian aircraft. Unless of course they're trying to somehow keep this quiet. I'm sure grounding flights would be the last thing they want to do and would be absolutely devasting to the economy and would cause pandemonium. Perhaps they've known about ufos all along and have been trying to keep it quiet bc just that. idk.
I'm not saying it's not. how the fk would I know. I popped up on my news feed and it's on Twitter.. I'm just saying I that I just read an article about it and thats what some people are saying.
I'm seeing reports now that it might be aliens. Supposedly 4) f16s were sent out to lake huron today and only 1 returned bc the other 3 got shot down. lol.
lol. I've seen reports that the one we shot down over lake huron was a ufo. supposedly we sent 4 - f16s out and only 1 returned. the other 3 got shot down.
