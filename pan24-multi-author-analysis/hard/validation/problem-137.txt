It's hardly unprecedented. Get 100,000 of your own men killed in a war no one asked for, piss off the entire planet (including your allies like China) and tank your already-failing economy, and you give a lot of people reasons to want you dead.
Putin clearly had a chip on his shoulder with Ukraine, and felt like he had nothing to lose. (Maybe the rumors of his illness had something to do with that.) I don't think the rest of the Russian mafia state is so inclined, and certainly wouldn't make the mistake of concentrating so much power into one person again.
However what might happen is that a decredibilised Putin or a new leader of Russia would not have the same iron grip over the political class. So a crisis like the would resolve differently. This would mean that other offices of the Russian Federation, that have their own legitimacy, or certain oligarchs that can buy popularity in their own fief, would become much harder to touch for the presidency.
Unfortunately, Putin's subordinates have the power to control the army organizations & Russia even its citizens. What's more, Wagner's mercenaries can kill boldly Russian protestors who wish to push down Putin's regime. But most Russian citizens don't have the guts to try that since they are men in the street, not superheroes. However, Zelenskyy's comment might annoy Putin's psychological status a little by little. If Zelenskyy aims to spark Putin's rage, it would be a successful one.
That's assuming Putin is even seeing any of these things that Zelensky is saying. I'm sure he's not browsing r/worldnews to see the next Zelensky click bait article. Or watch this documentary he just made.
