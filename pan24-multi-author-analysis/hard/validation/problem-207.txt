The opioid "epidemic" began with people being able to get FDA approved prescription drugs in excess either from their doctors or from dealers.
It's no coincidence that the availability of prescription drugs went down just as fentanyl demand increased.
The fault here lies with the crackdown on prescription opioids without addressing the reason for the demand they only created a demand for fentanyl, a much more inconsistent and dangerous drug.
Fentanyl overdoses happen because in the black market, there is no quality control or consistency, allowing for the adulteration of fentanyl into the opioid supply in the first place.
If we are talking in the purest most basic sense, when we are talking about why specifically these fentanyl overdoses are happening, it is because the state created a black market.
We are not talking about what caused demand, or what caused addiction, we are talking about fault for overdoses specifically.
Demand without means to get actual prescription drugs creates and reinforces the black market for opioids. It is nearly impossible to get prescription opioids now and in a lot of cases the doctors don't have the permission to prescribe it to you even if they think you need it. If you know what a real pain killer feels like and you know no amount of Tylenol, Aleve, or ibuprofen is going to help you then you will search elsewhere.
