Britian made slavery illegal before the vast majority of the globe and was among the first nations in history to do so ever. This particularly impressive given that slavery has been around since before writing and was endemic across the globe.
Britian spent an enormous amount of money fighting slavery across the globe. Regularly tried to enforce slavery bans within its African holdings (yes that's right, the Africans wanted to continue slavery and unfortunately were largely able to) and it's other territories.
Britian set up the West Africa Squadron to hunt down slave ships bound for the Americas at great expense whilst trying to deal with its geopolitical concerns of the time. Britian attacked and destroyed Portuguese slave ships at anchor in Brazil to try to force them to give up slavery.
The British crown shipped more slaves to the Americas than any other company in the history of the Atlantic slave trade. Between 1690-1807, over 6 million slaves were brought to the Americas on British ships. They literally branded the Duke of York into the slaves.
