> Harry writes that William urged him to hit back, citing fights they had as children. Harry says he refused to do so. William left, Harry says, then returned “looking regretful, and apologised”.
The article quotes the incident as happening in 2019, with William grabbing Harry by the collar and throwing him to the floor during an argument about Meghan. It’s a little different than kids fighting.
Fights when you’re kids are one thing. Getting physically violent as actual adults unless one is physically defending oneself or someone vulnerable is fucked up. The article quotes Harry as saying the fight happened in 2019. If true, that was less than 4 years ago. They’re too old to be putting hands on each other.
Based on uncle Andy alone, time to shut the whole thing down. But I’m in the USA. So I don’t have to pay for this. And I don’t buy the tourist angle. There are so many things to do in London, I never went near the palace.
One thing which would help is to acknowledge different sons and daughters have different relationships. A parent who was great to one kid may have been awful to another. Respect the relationships may have been different.
