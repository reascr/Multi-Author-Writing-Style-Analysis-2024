It's the non partisan polls that people should pay attention to. There have been too many right leaning pollsters just putting out poll after poll of Republicans in the lead only for a non partisan poll to come out showing the Democrats in the lead.
But non partisan pollsters do a better job of following George Gallop's quota system unlike right leaning pollsters. An example of this is Insider Average(?) a right leaning pollster did a poll of PA after the debate that showed Oz up by three, the problem is that only fourteen percent of respondents were young people who made up twenty-five percent of the electorate in 2018 and twenty-eight percent in 2020 in PA, and it didn't have enough black respondents as well.
Yes, because you want to make sure your team wins. If people see their guy down by five or six, people might not see the point in voting for a candidate that they don't think can win anyways.
Seriously, if even 5% of this sub got 1 person to vote, who otherwise wouldn’t have voted, then that’s over 400,000 votes, which is crazy.
Spread the word around the sub to not only vote, but the idea of getting 1 other person you know to vote or vote with you in person.
To guarantee your effort(s) have an impact, try to get help or encourage someone you know well to vote. There might be a young person you are close to that may not plan on voting, if you’re voting in person, try to get them to vote with you.
I have a feeling that a lot of 18 year-olds are stepping into adulthood not knowing how to form their own political opinions or even how to vote.
Like you pointed, I also think polls became more "reactionary", in that they tend to capture people who want their opinions to be heard.
Imo even the non partisan polls are not great, and the issue is poling is becoming a lot more difficult (or not having biased polls). In the past, you could opened a phone book and randomly called people, everyone had a landline and 95% would have responded since there was no way (or a very limited way) of knowing who was calling. Having long phone conversations was a usual part of life, so you could conduct detailed surveys and a series of follow up surveys.
Yeah many top tier pollsters to a mixture of polls and blend the results using model that they predict to reflect the populace. But again the models are mostly based on past elections and the census, and could cause inaccurate weighing of the results. For example, you might be responding more to surveys at a ratio of 60% to 40%, but based on past elections and the census, the surveyor might think it would be close to 50-50 during the elections and adjust the results by weighing woman less . Well... it might turn out to be 60-40 during the election as well.
