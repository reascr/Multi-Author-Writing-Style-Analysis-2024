At least when you smear one second, you remain within the +/- 0.9 seconds tolerance of a well designed system. But +/- 1 minute in navigation error is over 16 miles. And, it would break some big money transfer security systems.
That's another way of saying that we all better hide for those two minutes. Banking, credit transactions, stock market, computer file transfers, air flights, even a lot of ship traffic in ports, .... they're all going to be really messed up for two minutes. People in cars using their GPS will miss their turns.
We already have very good synchronizing of clocks, that's not the problem. The problem is the damn Earth! It doesn't rotate once every exactly 24 hours (relative to the sun), and yet a lot of applications depend on 24 hours. Such as silly humans, who don't want sunrise being labeled as "2:00 AM". A lot of computerized stuff needs Earth rotation time = UTC time +/- 0.9 seconds (astronomers, and satellites).
I think the earth's rotation and the year are probably the two things that matter most as far as measuring time is concerned.
I would suggest that we replace months with deciyears (36 days per deciyear), and replace hours, minutes and seconds with millidays and microdays.
