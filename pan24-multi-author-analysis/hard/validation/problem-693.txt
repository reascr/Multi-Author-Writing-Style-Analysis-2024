He serves a purpose. He is an opiate for a very rowdy subset of Russians(hard-liners) and additionally sows confusion and fear(though this doesn't land like they think it does) by letting the west hear his speeches as well.
While generally you're right, Russian government uselessly threatened a lot, there was a shift recently, it's no longer a colonial war done with expedition force of regular military, there's more and more push in the media that it's a serious all out war, including Putin's . Putin would have preferred not to do anything, there were indications that he might try another big push, which is why Ukraine asked for heavy weaponry quicker, etc.
Im looking forward to seeing what Russia can muster at this point, but the war will definitely be on "a new level", but not in Russias favor. Let's give Ukrainians all the weapons they ask for, tanks, jets, ASAP and let's end this war before Russia drags the rest of the world into their terror regime.
We just need to give Ukraine better weapons b/c this is a war of attrition and Putin does not care how many of his troops die - so we need to help Ukraine do a better job of killing them efficiently - preferably well behind the front lines.
Putin's desire to do another big offensive is due to the fact that western countries are relatively slow to give new types of weapons to Ukraine (like current conversations about Leopard tanks), so the faster he attacks, less time Ukraine and its allies have to arm the military.
Putin might need some kind of victory to justify the war, although an ongoing war without changes is also very beneficial - allows him to do whatever he wants inside the country, because everything can be explained away by the needs of the war. But it's only if he can guarantee that the situation won't change, and with Ukraine getting more and more weapons it might, even if it will take half a year to a year.
