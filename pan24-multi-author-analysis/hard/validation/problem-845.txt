Weâ€™re getting a whack job for speaker no matter who prevails from the hate group known as the GOP. Let themselves keep looking like idiots in the meantime.
Get fucked with this stupid opinion. The republicans can back a "centrist" dem. Tired of the Democrats having to be the ones to compromise, especially in cases like this, where its entirely the fault of the GOP for being such a cluster fuck.
What a shit take anyone seriously saying democrats should work with Republicans over this are either Republicans themselves or morons. All democrats should do is sit back and keep voting Jeffries, let Republicans solve their mess afterall they have the majority and therfore the votes/mandate right?
If we want to make hypothetical with them that we can be sure benefit Dems, why not get just a few House Republicans to vote present, allowing for Jeffries majority to win out? That's a deal we can depend on and one that might actually stand a better chance of happening.
Because the minute a Dem influenced Speaker vote becomes a real possibility is the minute the GOP rallies around McCarthy.
Also, the problem at hand is that McCarthy isn't extreme enough for some Republicans, and all the other GOP members are trying to rally behind the guy with the most votes. Suggesting the Dems put forward a moderate Republican will satisfy neither of those groups of people.
Lastly, siding with Dems here-- even in support of a mythical moderate Republican-- is political suicide for Republicans and they all know that.
Can I ask what McCarthy has done to earn so much of your trust here? Or is this just a matter of "why not try it, what's the worst that could happen" for you?
