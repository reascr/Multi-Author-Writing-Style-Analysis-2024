People who slowly waste after 1+ year usually end up with a walker/ wheelchair towards the end. For me to believe that A) he has a terminal condition (which does seem plausible with how he looks) and that B) his prognosis is 'eminently fatal' I need Putin to be in a wheelchair or walking with assistance or completely out of public eye without a confirmed recent/ live appearance. Like Putin seen traveling on plane, walked off the plane and outside media saw this. Not a televised live, indoor interview. That can be pre-recorded. I mean like out and about. Mentions something specific in the last say or two. The bombing of 68, I mean 97, I mean 154 Russian troops.
Unless they are clearly avoiding having Putin appear or he's in a wheelchair he might be actively dying, but he's not on death's doorstep.
I put a curse on Putin before Christmas in 2021, that his health would fade and he would quickly succumb to a fatal illness.
The next day I started seeing reports that he may have Parkinson's and since then it's only continued to snowball.
