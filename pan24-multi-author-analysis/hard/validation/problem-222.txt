Sure, and I understand that point - their claim was that China is better at wielding soft power than the US, which is what I was curious about how they came to that conclusion.
Beyond that, the US never has been very good at wielding soft power as compared to the Chinese for example. The US approach has always been a much more direct stick and carrot approach, and honestly you can't tell me that the average American has a single clue as to the cultural intricacies of pretty much any other country in the world you care to name.
In the case of the US, the answer is simple, you don't care and you just brute force the whole thing with no knowledge of, or respect for the other nation...
How exactly do you make foreign policy work if you don't have clue one as to the culture of another nation?
Yes, I suppose, but it's still more true than not, and the main reason why I like pushing this button is because a lot of this is pretty much utterly ignored in US education or the US media for the most part.
