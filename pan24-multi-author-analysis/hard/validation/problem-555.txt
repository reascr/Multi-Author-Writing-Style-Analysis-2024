And I don't think that after Putin's death next leader would be someone who loves West. BTW nuclear disarmament should be 1st condition before ending sanctions.
It was not very kind answer. You should realise that if we won't completely destroy Russian economy than after few years they will start this shit all over again. In my opinion Putin is our guarantee that Russia will fall to the very bottom.
I agree 100% but after total bancruptcy of Russia. It will be much more painful for him to die knowing that he won't be remembered as new Peter the Great but pathetic destructor of Russia.
It will be much better if Putin will stay as a ruler of Russia. It is in fact the worst scenario for Russia's military power, economy and prestige. They will suffer so much losses in any field that they won't be threat for any neighbour country for at least two decades. Long live Putin. His death could give Russia chance to undo this stupid falling into chasm.
But, when Putin dies, they will use him as a scape goat and reason to stop the bleeding, and try to fix their economy.
Yeah those Oligarchs arenâ€™t just gonna go turn themselves in once Putin dies.. they are going to do what happened at the end of the Cold War that turned them into oligarchs in the first place..
