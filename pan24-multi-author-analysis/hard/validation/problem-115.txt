Actually resolution was accepted with amendment L.52 which inserts a new operative paragraph, reading: “Notes with alarm that the Russian Federation has sought to justify its territorial aggression against Ukraine on the purported basis of eliminating neo-Nazism, and underlines that the pretextual use of neo-Nazism to justify territorial aggression seriously undermines genuine attempts to combat neo-Nazism”.
“Moscow's attempt to exploit the pretext of combating neo-Nazism to justify its brutal war against Ukraine, with Ukraine's delegate asserting that the draft has nothing in common with the genuine fight against Nazism and neo-Nazism.”.
The problem for Ukraine is that the one of their national heroes worked with the nazis and did some nasty stuff, which is exactly why russia has been pushing this motion.
Of course we all know how the equivalent of useful idiots and tankies supported the Nazis, others then supported the USSR , and now apparently they spread Russian propaganda for them.
The Azov group were being retrained and had been out under national command - ironically the Russian invasion and their defence of Mariupol will have actually realised their prestige.
I’m fact the usual suspects are the Azov battalion who were at most 6,000 strong in a total military force of something like 200,000 regulars and the same again national guard? Funnily enough the quest-fascist mercenary Wagner group is actually larger.
Far right Nationalists won a fraction and indeed a falling fraction of the vote in the last Ukraine elections. Far , far less than can be said won in Russian elections!
