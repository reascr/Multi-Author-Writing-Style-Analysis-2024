We have two hypotheticals which require someone to believe that China is objectively more evil than the USA. Because the biggest fear here seems to be control of those semi conductor plants going from Taiwan (aka whatever the USA says) to China. You are assuming an absolutely worst case scenario with China in control when the spectrum is huge. Whereas war with China has 2 options economic destruction with nuclear destruction or just economic destruction, a bunch of dead people(not as many with no nukes), and wasted tax dollars.
Interesting, tell me do any of those consequences sound as bad as nuclear war? What does everyone think will happen if China invades Taiwan and the US declares War on China? The worlds 2 largest militaries and economies go to war and that works out better than China just taking the island?
If China invades, it will be ruinous for the world economy whether America decides to shoot back or not. There is no going back to previously established trade relationships in that event.
