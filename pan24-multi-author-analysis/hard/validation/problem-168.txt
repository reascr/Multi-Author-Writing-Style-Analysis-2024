For so many years, decades even, russia has been living off this fear they presented to the world. Of their army, of their military might, their military weapons, their military intelligence. They showed themselves as ravenous bears on the battlefield. In reality, that masquerade popped as though that ravenous bear was truthfully a balloon bear.
While this war is not over, I believe it will irreparably reshape the forces of power in Europe and Asia.
I find this fascinating. This war is horrible, but as an observer of military conflicts and one who studies past wars in history, this has been very interesting. Between the determination of the Ukrainian army, citizens, and leaders, to the idiotic choices of russia and their military incompetence.
Russia's military has always been corrupt, infested with political appointees, and general incompetent at logistics.
I knew a year ago that Russia wouldn't be able to take the Ukraine--or at least without a serious, grueling fight that would tax their economy and military to the limit.
Do you think if NATO had the same level of mental commitment to defeating Russia that Russia has to fucking up Ukraine that NATO wouldn't mop the floor with Russia very quickly?

Personally... a "tiny" bit of me wishes the collective allied forces would just do a joint operation to wipe out Russia's front-line; just a quick 24 hour operation and then back-off.
