It's also done this way, so people can't try to coerce Ukraine to just giving in. Russia has decided it will throw as many bodies at the war as needed to win, because losing is not an option for a narsacist like Putin. If Ukraine's losses were reported in the same manner, the narrative would shift to them just giving up for the sake of the people. They just don't take in to account that Ukrainian people would rather fight to the last breath, than give in to Putin.
Zelensky knows he has full US and NATO support. Russia will lose no matter what, just how long they drag it out is up to them. We just need to repeat the same line, no peace until Ukraine, ALL of Ukraine, is free from Russian control.
It's only a matter of time until Ukraine takes all their territory back from Russia, including Crimea.
Are you trying to say that Ukraine must invade russia in order to win? I legit can't tell. Or that russia must lose territory in russia in order to take it back, thus winning?
So you think Ukraine should invade russia in order to win the war? Would that satiate your victim complex? I do not think they should do that. As much as my opinion on russia and Russian people has hit the floor recently I still don't approve of making innocent people suffer. I guess we have a different view on the worth of human lives.
