California has experienced rolling blackouts in the summer but never have i heard about blackouts in the winter and certainly not protracted ones. If thousands of people had to frequently heat their homes with cooking stoves, that would be major news. How often have your family had to do this in the last 10 years? You write as if this is a real fear, so make clear how often this need occurs.
While pipes can break from frost, this doesn’t happen to indoor pipes as easily as you suggest. Its only anecdotal but I’ve had a break in an unheated part of my house only once in 20 years. Its been 30 since I’ve experienced a blackout. And key to your comment, a gas stove in the kitchen would not provide the heat needed to keep pipes from breaking.
I had a glass top electric stove and I learned that if you have nothing on another burner just keep the other side on the temps needed.
Now, in my own house, I invested in a induction stove and am at least as happy as with gas. It reacts fast, spilled milk doesn't burn in and the glass surface is easier to clean than the gas stove. Would never accept anything else again.
I grew up with a gas stove and loved it. When I had my first own appartement with an conventional electric stovetop I wasn't even able anymore to cook spaghetti without making a mess because I was so used to the quick response of gas.
