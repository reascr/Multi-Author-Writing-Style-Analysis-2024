Usually you tell people to vote with their wallets, but if you do that here you run the risk of death. This is literally extortion. The taxpayers funded this, why are we being forced to pay more?
Yes, taxpayers did fund it. In fact, pretty much every medicine you've ever heard of has been largely, if not fully, funded through grants paid out by various governments.
Why do you think they do public funding in the first place? It's because they don't want to risk their own money on something that may not work. They're greedy as hell, so risking 0% of their wealth is a massive incentive, even if the amount of profit they're allowed to make off of something is capped.
Better idea: anything developed with public funding can have no more than a 2% profit margin. If it's entirely privately funded, go ahead, jack the price up 10,000%, be a dickbag. Even 1% of it was funded through public funding, screw off.
They're welcome to try negotiating a better deal, but my starting position is 2% cap. And even if it was negotiated to a 200% cap, it would still ultimately be a better deal for everyone that takes medicine, because they couldn't suddenly decide the drugs they make are actually worth twenty billion times more tomorrow than they were yesterday.
