Excellent news. The only other thing I wish they would add is a limitation on Chinese investment in the US real-estate market too. If you don't live in the country or don't have dual citizenship you shouldn't be able to buy up property.
Canâ€™t get around private ownership for apartments, but a home for family life should not be subject to that.
I don't have an issue with corporations owning rental properties. I've dealt with both independent landlords and corporate landlords, and by far I prefer corporate ones, because they do everything by the book and by the rules.
I've never had a corporate landlord try to fuck me out of a deposit, whereas literally every independent landlord I've had has. I've never had a corporate landlord refuse to fix an appliance until I lodged a complaint with the residential tenancy board. I've never had a corporate landlord after being forced to fix or replace an appliance then attempt to illegally bill me for the repair or replacement. I've never had a corporate landlord illegally put 8 migrant workers in the 1br suite next to mine. I've never had a corporate landlord attempt to prevent me from inviting friends to visit me. I've never had a corporate landlord attempt to illegally increase my rent higher than the law allows.
Renting any should become landlord territory, in a legal view. They should be treated as a business.
