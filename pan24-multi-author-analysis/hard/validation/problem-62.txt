I wholeheartedly agree with Alzheimer, dementia, terminal cancer and other cases like that, but when mental illness comes into the picture, I don't know...
The fact that they were in a position where they realised they could commit suicide right there and then made more people commit suicide than if they didn't have an opportunity like that. So if we extrapolate that to this situation, more people might commit suicide, even though their condition is oftentimes treatable.
If it's not a choice when the options are inescapable poverty or death, then what do you call it when the only possible option is inescapable poverty, due to suicide prevention policies that stop the suicide but don't address the causes of suicidal feelings?
Besides what if he isn't in such a state, can a person who thinks it's better to die than live in poverty for example be considered mentally well?
No, it's not actually a choice when they're given the option of a) inescapable poverty and b) death.
The problem is when people want to die because the government denies them quality of life. Such as disability payments that aren't enough to afford housing.
