The end result was 58.8% to 40.6%. again huge margins, but nothing like what the map would indicate. 40% of the population was not in favor of Reagan.
They were recounting before the SC made that decision and there was a riot that stopped the recounts. The riot was lead by Roger Stone and at least one other person. Without that riot Gore very likely could have pulled off a win in FL and became president. Between Roger Stone and the SC they stole that election for Bush, and we will never know who should have actually won it.
That election wasn't close, but it was closer than people realize. That map, like all national election maps, doesn't tell the story accurately at all.
I'm being pedantic, I know, but it kind of shows even more how often the polls and maps can skew peoples perspectives on what's going on.
Just to clarify. 40% of the people who voted were not in favor of Reagan. Typically less than half the population of the US ever votes.
30-50% of the voters in this country start with the conclusion that they will vote for the Republican and then back solve their beliefs/values from there.
Iâ€™m going to guess that a lot of people decided not to vote in the midterm since Illinois is usually so guaranteed. Also the slander against Pritzker has been very intense his entire term, and the backlash against the lockdowns, even in Chicago and the suburbs, was very loud.
