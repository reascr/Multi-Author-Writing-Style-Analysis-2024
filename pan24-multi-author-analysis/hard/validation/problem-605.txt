Non Muslims arenâ€™t allowed to pray on the Temple Mount. The Israeli police will kick you out if you do anything resembling prayer to say nothing of the Waqf.
Israeli police do so because the Wakf demands it. It's part of the agreement Israel has with Jordan to prevent the Palestinians from rioting. The threat of Palestinian riots are the reason we have this situation. Israel is essentially caving to fascists and religious fundamentalists due to the threat of violence. Nobody should cave to those lunatics. That's appeasement and it only makes things worse.
Israel has always been a secular government. Jewish law is not Israeli law. Israeli law is not determined by Rabbis. It is determined by the people's elected representatives in the Knesset (Parliament).
The fight against bigotry and anti-Semitism is political, so there is nothing wrong with making a political statement in this case. More people should be making political statements against the bigotry and apartheid policies being implemented by Arab nations.
