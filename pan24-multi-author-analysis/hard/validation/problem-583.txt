Rick Scott was the CEO and oversaw the biggest medicare fraud in US history, resulting in the largest healthcare fraud fine ever levied by the DOJ.
Rick Scott wasn't just 'connected'. Rick Scott, who NOW is the wealthiest senator in the senate and his company were literally defrauding taxpayers.
It's a great joke because it absolutely is what happened -- the money he made from this fraud bankrolled both of his governorships and his Senate campaign. He never admitted fault for the fraud even though he was the CEO when it happened, the company took all of the blame, therefore nobody went to jail, and Scott kept all of the proceeds he "earned" while the fraud was being committed. He then has had three successive campaigns where he won by less than 1%. The guy stole federal money, barely won thrice, and now he's pulling up the ladder (Medicare and Social Security cuts) because he believes the federal government is misappropriating money. Isn't that just classic?
