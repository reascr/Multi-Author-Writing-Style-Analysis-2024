You don’t actually change the pronunciation, it’s just to closer transliterate the Arabic since the original word doesn’t exactly have a K sound. I explained more in another reply to the top-level comment.
So the question is, since English doesn’t even have that sound, do you “simplify” it to English speakers by writing it as a K (generally the older way of doing it), or do you go for a more “faithful” transliteration by writing it as a Q (what’s usually done nowadays)? Personally, I go for using a Q, since Arabic also has the letter ك which sounds like a regular K, and using K for both of them introduces ambiguities. Even though it’s a use of the letter Q that doesn’t have a long history in English and can thus be confusing to some people, I think that as terms like Qur’an with a Q become more familiar to English speakers, they’ll remember without much difficulty that Q is pronounced like K in these loanwords. Although you do have to remember that this “Q spelling = K sound” rule only works for Arabic, and may not hold true for romanizations from other languages, e.g. Chinese, where the rule is more like “Q spelling = Ch sound”. (Oh, and the reason I write Qur’an with the apostrophe in the middle is because there’s actually a glottal stop in the word in Arabic, which is important in that language. The glottal stop is often ignored in romanization because some languages basically treat it as “not a real sound”, and I think that’s stupid, personally.).
Yes. There are exceptions to the rule, but I find the majority of Islamic centric countries are against freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom from faith. Sharia law and its implementation is a sickness that effects almost every majority Muslim country.
Quranists (those who only follow the Quran) are heavily persecuted in all Muslim-majority countries. Many don’t regard them as “true Muslims” or refer to them as apostates.
To go a step beyond this, I could also claim something else that may shock you but Muslims actually don't actually worship the prophet. Ask anyone and they will say they worship god, not Muhammad. To put Quran on an equal pedestal as Hadith and to claim all muslims value both equally is wrong too. It's a huge blanket statement. There is a huge disparity in the muslim religion when it comes to this and as I mentioned it's very much something that is personal, traditional and familial. When muslims pray together you have no idea which hadith the other believes in or does not. Religious scholars have been debating the value of many of them and trying to verify them. It's something that is actually encouraged and done daily so to say that if you don't believe in a Hadith you will be persecuted is again just another huge blanket statement.
