I honestly think what Congress may do one day is pass a federal right to abortion in the first trimester (or X number of weeks) and then let states decide beyond that. But before that happens, we're going to have to hear/see all sorts of cases where women and girls die needlessly.
You don't think this current SC may do something equally stupid before the next election? They could just turn out to be the gift that keeps on giving for the Dems!
I don't think people who vote GOP are doing it in spite of the insurrection. They're doing it because they think the insurrection was justified. Conservative media pushes the big lie narrative nonstop and completely ignores the 60+ court cases all over the country that the GOP lost due to lack of evidence when they challenged the 2020 election results. They're just living in a completely different paradigm with a completely different source of information.
Oh, I agree the bad behavior will continue. The GOP is known for doing absolutely no introspection. They're going to have to keep losing for several more election cycles before it sinks in.
I will never miss another election after everything with the GOP all the progress lost. I will vote for the rest of my life in every single local and federal election that I can against GOP until the day I die.
