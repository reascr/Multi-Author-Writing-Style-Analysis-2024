I've been following this war since I have an interest in military history and things (which makes it kinda morbid tbh) and because I hate Putin funding what amounts to neo fascism, so my credentials are of someone that os very vaguely aware of stuff rather than completely clueless, take me as a girl sharing gossip.
Ukraine has taken considerable efforts to do a military reform ever since Crimea (IIRC it was named something like "desovietization") showed the UA to be kinda bad, in that they took efforts to decrease and mitigate corruption, improve organization, modernize equipment....they even changed the uniforms AFAIK (and I don't mean camouflage, I'm taking about far more meaningless stuff like their berets).
Anyways, one of the things I saw mentioned about this on reddit is that the particular air defense rocket that hit Poland lacks a self destruction mechanism, I'm assuming that's common nowadays, and allows to remotely destroy a AD rocket if it misses something or goes rogue.
It's enough to destroy or fell another flying missile, and prob at \some distance too (I doubt these are basically guided gyro jets and just slam into the intercepted missile).
I doubt there is any ADA in existence that doesnâ€™t have an automated self destruct mechanism to prevent the missile from coming back down.
Being careless is the entire point of a missile defense system, it's supposed to do everything in it's power to stop the missile. Sometimes it will destroy a cruise missile mid-air and the warhead will land in somebodies house and still kill people.
