It is completely accurate to say that Democrats got the tax returns, because basically only Democrats are trying to get his tax returns.
Why would you say “Democrats Are Now In Possession…” By law the tax returns are being handed over to Congress. You make it sound like they are being given exclusively to the Democrats. Not true. This is all about government, not party specific (except that Republicans will probably at least pretend that they don’t want to see them).
Part of the problem is dems/Republicans only work together to prevent third parties from getting on ballots. Andrew Yang had a pod episode talking about it, it’s wild the shot they do.
If you want to run for President your whole life becomes an open book. The public should have access to at least 10 years worth of your actual tax returns maybe even all your tax returns. No bullshit short BS form. EVERYTHING. How can we elect anyone who will be the most powerful figure in the world and not demand to know them inside and out. It’s fing preposterous.
Seriously it’s ridiculous. If anything was there, it would have come out a decade ago. We all know Big Tech billionaires pay very little taxes, percentage-wise. Why would another billionaire be any different. They’re all just playing their game.
