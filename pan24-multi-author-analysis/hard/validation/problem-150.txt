Uhhh no? The Taliban didn't have much in the way of anti-aircraft capabilities. Air-dropping supplies into territory controlled by sandal-wearing insurgents is an entirely different story than air-dropping supplies into the middle of the country with the second-largest military in Europe.
In the international arena, there's no need for "mechanisms". You do what you want and if all your friends are fine with it, it doesn't matter that your enemies are whining about it.
There's no "NATO Supreme Court" that Turkey could file a lawsuit to in protest of their "illegal" expulsion from NATO. If the rest of NATO is fine with it, then it's fine.
NATO is already there, as a member and an important one at that. Don't expect some kind of righteous intervention, the world doesn't work that way. It all comes down to what serves NATO best and is it a small member in financial ruin or is it the most powerful in the region and a foothold in the middle east as well as on Russias flank?
The most cynical view of what's best for NATO is to defend Greece and partition Turkey into smaller more easily controlled puppet states. (As current Turkey doesn't obey when ordered.).
