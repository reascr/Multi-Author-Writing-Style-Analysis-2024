I'm not sure, but I heard (someone correct me if I'm wrong) that green berets do a lot of ground/espionage work. Assessing the political/cultural landscape through immersion, destabilizing regimes, toppling governments, and all that. I'm guessing navy seals are more combat oriented.
There are different tiers of Navy Seals. The "normal" Navy SEALs are of course elite, but are comparable to other Special Operations forces like Army Rangers, Green Berets, MARSOC, etc. Although they all have different roles, specialties, and training, which can explain differences in training costs.
I wouldn't be surprised if $1.5M is how much it costs to train an SF soldier to the bare minimum to qualify for placement on a team. Those guys never stop training, the veterans who have been in for years will have had much more money invested in their training over that time.
DEVGRU aka Seal Team Six is made up of the best veteran SEALs, and would be considered to be more elite than all the aforementioned because they're picked from an already-elite group. Those are the guys that were sent to get Bin Laden. Alongside Delta Force (which is similarly made up of the best Rangers and Green Berets) they're probably the most elite combat units in the US military.
