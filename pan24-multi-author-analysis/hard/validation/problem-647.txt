I'm not a socialist, but 1% of the people in America owning 30% of the wealth, or whatever the latest number is, is ridiculous and fucks over the 99%. What rich people, sorry, I mean job creators, don't understand is that if there's no middle class, nobody can buy your stuff. Greed is evil.
I believe the paradigm of socialism, or one of them, is wealth distribution. Saying I'm not a socialist reinforces to me, that the the wealthy are pushing this kind of government tilt and even non-socialists agree it is warranted.
I would argue that we're at a point right now where things are about to break, in part, because we spent decades convincing ourselves that the choice was somehow not between socialism or barbarism.
I got news for you. The system we live under right now could confiscate anyone's wealth at will in a host of ways. But the people who are pestered with IRS audits, civil forfeitures, debt collectors, social security liens, medical debt, fees from being chewed up and spat out of our criminal justice system, etc. are the working class first and foremost.
There is no USSR to go back to. Also, it's a foolish comment for the reason that rather than discuss with me about the kind of society we ought to be fighting for and working towards, you just want to deflect to an entirely different country - and one that no longer exists at that.
I think we ought to lean into the fact that it is socialism vs. capitalism and get ourselves knowledgeable, organized, serious, and mobilized.
We are at a point where it's not a matter of socialists vs capitalists and instead one where things are about to break because people clutch onto words with no context.
