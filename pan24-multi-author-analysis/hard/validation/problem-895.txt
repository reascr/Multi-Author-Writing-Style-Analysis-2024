Also, he and his party made sure those of us in states that actually invest in our public sector hand over more federal dollars to states that refuse to do so, and encourage our states to behave more like theirs.
Even worse for them, they made the tax cuts for the less affluent look bigger than they really were, meaning that even a lot of people who still came ahead didn't feel like they had come out ahead.
No they'd be happy to pay that tax as it's regressive, it's even worse for low income people than a flat income tax that doesn't increase with income bracket, because lower income people tend to spend a greater fraction of their income on actual stuff. So it ends up being a 20-30% total tax on the poor, and less than 1% for the rich, rather than it being the opposite now.
Removing income and other taxes and replacing them with a sales tax moves ALMOST ALL TAXES from the rich to the Middle class and poor.
The national sales tax also would eliminate the income tax. Actually, it eliminates the IRS entirely. Without IRS agents, there are no audits of the rich. The IRS already does not have the capacity to track down the multiple ways the ultra rich hide their income, thereby avoiding taxes, and these SOBs want to make it even easier for the rich to hide their money.
Of course, in their zeal to make the ultra rich even richer on the backs of working class Americans, the GOP national sales tax eliminates the estate tax and the capital gains, gift and corporate taxes.
Just like the Trump tax cuts, it is a continuation of the republican money grab for the very wealthy.
