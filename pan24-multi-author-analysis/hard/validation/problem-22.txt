He allowed leaked cables to go through, un redacted, that put operatives at risk and/or got them killed. There's still a limit to "just reporting." There is still responsibility.
There were some leaks that absolutely should have been shared with US citizens on some level. The friendly fire incidents the military tried to sweep under the rug...including deliberate murders of Iraqi civilians. We pay for this military, we vote for those who approve its budget, we absolutely deserve to be informed on mistakes, crimes, and failures.
Between that and his contradictory behavior when it came to US adversaries, he was not acting as a neutral provider of transparency, but rather an enemy of the state.
No, what he did was to release information that was damaging to the USA in an effort to hurt that country, not to expose questionable activities. It didn't matter who's lives were endangered, he released stuff guided by hate of one country.
And his information got people killed, let's not forget that. Free speech is fine, but there are consequences for what you say, that's not a part of the right to free speech.
Regardless, he aught to be protected under the right to free press, not the right to free speech. He disseminated information that was categorically within the public interest.
