True. A horrible political decision. They should have done their own search of documents, turned them over and then let the DOJ investigate.
Because, per the article, the Biden team halted the initial search upon finding the documents and requested the DOJ help in completing the search. True it’s embarrassing however the “how it happened” is pretty clear in the article. There were documents, a few were found, bidens team involved professionals to help search for the rest, the media reports each instance separately to make for a better story. People can and should take from that as they will.
Don’t disagree. It’s been commented everywhere that on the hill if you want anyone to read anything it has to be marked classified otherwise no one has time for it. I suspect there is rampant issues with this in quite a few people in government. But to your point the system needs to be improved.
I’d be ok with that. Course… if we DO do that seems reasonable to do a search of all politicians residences to make sure no one running has any documents either though.
I think it’s reasonable to ask if this isn’t a little to convenient finding the classified documents. I suspect that Garland could be asking the same questions. Just speculating.
