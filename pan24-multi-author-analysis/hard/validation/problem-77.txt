The House Clerk will inform them that they are in violation of House rules and ask them to leave the floor, and they will not be allowed to vote. This is the process if a man doesn’t wear a tie or a jacket in the missouri house as well. The dress code in missouri house is-.
That's basically what the dress code is now. Men have to wear suit, tie, slacks, and dress shoes. Now women must wear pants, blazer, dress shoes. Before that they were allowed a blazer or a sweater.
They removed the sweater and added a cardigan. That's it. It's the same dress code as what's in the supreme court and roughly the same as the us Senate and Congress.
It's actually a dress code that's long been held in Missouri. They would remove you from the building until compliance. Male dress codes are stricter.
My point was that men had to wear suit jackets already as part of dress code. Now women are held to the same standard. It’s understandable that governments representatives have dress codes to account for some minimum of decorum when at the statehouse.
I’m usually the last to care but I get that in a building of government they need to set minimums to uphold decorum. Not doing it for everyone is just prejudiced.
