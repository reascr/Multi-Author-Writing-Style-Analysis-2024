While they are obviously smuggling things, there is no way you can do that for any quantity remotely close to what they need.
China’s exports to Russia has gone down to half from December 2021 to May/June 2022. Not sure if it has increased any substantial amount since then given the trajectory. I would assume China’s oil/gas imports from Russia however has increased at a reduced price that is very benefitial for China and a long term suicide for Russia.
The other side of it is a lot of countries are not buying russian oil or vastly reduced their intake in favour of other sources, meaning the buy from other countries/economies which is good for those economies. Standard market prices haven't dropped so everyone else selling oil is getting their regular price per barrel.
This price cap doesn't exist on any other oils products from other economies, it's purely a sanction against Russia. It's actually good for other economies who buy oil IF they want to buy russian sourced oil, coz they get it at a 33% discount.
The oil conglomerates and other economies generally set a maximum price per barrel they were willing to buy at(if at all) from Russian sources. A price cap.
Generally, oil prices are stable or slightly elevated. Russian oil prices are low. This weakens the rouble and doesn't negatively affect other currencies, so the rouble continues it's decline in purchasing power.
