Funny how we don't see 'CBS and FOX on the hotseat for pushing gambling ads during family sporting events.'.
\ If anything, I would imagine there are outlines in the contract that requires the partners to buy advertising from the networks on a schedule outlined by the NFL and the partners. It's mutually beneficial.
All paid for by those companies... so again, the issue is with the networks selling the space to them.
We know what they told us - they would have no reason to withhold a simple thing like this. Further, the partnership reduces the need for ads anyway as their branding is visible throughout the product as it airs. The ads are icing on top because they get even more.
This isn't about gambling - it's about advertising. If you're upset about the ads - blame the one party that actually sells the ad space. The networks.
What does this have to do with those networks? The networks are running ads, and when they are not, they are displaying promotional materials for those sites. Or starting their own "pick them" game.
