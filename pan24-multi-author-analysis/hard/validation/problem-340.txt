If you read the article the fact it's a film directed by a woman is quite relevant. Passage from the article:
"I think if you're going to work through the list, maybe do it in reverse order and sort of build towards it, because it's quite an ask to invite people to see this.
Makes me wonder if it would be anything but an obscure old film had it been about a man and directed by a man.
I doubt that previous best ever film had "film directed by man..) headline. Also, article says that there were times, when those who selectected best films were criticized for choosing films without enough diversity. This choice might just be them trying to deflect this criticism, not because the film is actually worth it, especially since it is barely known to the general public, as opposed to previous selected films. The best thing would be not to include any characteristics of film directors themselves, so that critics would not be able to put their own stereotypes into judging the film. This way, best film wins.
