And Republicans will ensure that cuts to the budget will deny as much aid to Ukraine as they can so their beloved conservative hero Putin can finally roll tanks theough Kyiv and execute Zelensky.
The issue is that the Republicans are using this as a cover for cutting aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russian (which many of them, and Trump himself, are clearly either outright compromised by and/or minimally way too cozy with).
Cutting a bloated defense budget is not a bad thing in and of itself, especially if the money was to be allocated to social programs, infrastructure, education, etc., and especially if its NOT done in a way that sacrifices a people who are standing up against the autocrat Putin and his actions which has included genocidal behavior (such as the theft of children in an effort to destroy the Ukrainian identity).
At a time when Russia and China are building up their forces, Russia is invading Ukraine, and China is preparing to invade Taiwan and the South China Sea islands, it's a bad idea to cut the defense budget.
Yes, military spending is bloated, BUT the timing of a sudden isolationist austerity push at a time we are barely winning a decisive proxy war against Russia is 100% inappropriate and in line with Russian hybrid warfare. And the GOP would be happy to watch the world burn if they could pin a major defeat on the Democrats, as the GOP did when we 'lost' China.
Seeing a lot of folks demand 50% cuts. Ok. If we demand blindly set artificial caps on prices, expect some bad consequences.
Yes, we should absolutely target corruption and waste in the military. The timing for austerity would have been more appropriate in the less adversarial 1990s or 2010s when we weren't facing both Russia and China, but the next best time for reform is now. But if we have a problem, we should go for that problem directly. Fund watchdogs and anti-corruption enforcement. This whole debate feels counterproductive, like the MAGA folks criticizing immigration while simultaneously supporting budget cuts on immigration judges.
