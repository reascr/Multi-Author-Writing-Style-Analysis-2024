Or perhaps, the other poster is correct, and you simply haven't educated yourself to the corruption occurring on both sides when it comes to wall street. Both the Democrat and Republican politicians are fully up for sale and will bend you over without hesitation.
You do realize that not all attacks on Democratic politicians are some sort of tacit support of Republicans right? I have never voted for a Republican in my life... That doesn't make me unable to see the bad shit Democrats do, and there are no shortage of democrats who vote in favor of bill that advance wall street interests at the cost of the public. We aren't talking about one democrat here or there but virtually all of them. Not based on what they say, based on the way they actually vote... when it actually matters.
As for the Hitler tie in. Hitler also drank water. But even still, the belief that all politicians are crooks this belief has had similar well before Hitler in fact, in 1875 address about taxation political corruption and accountability Walter B Pierce gave a whole fucking speech about it. Look it up, its available on google books so piss off with that horseshit.
Additionally, in 1983 Frank Sneep former CIA agent let loose that as part of their training deception about what was being done in a given government proved relatively ineffective as time moved on. What was effective was telling truths that would upset the populace if they got out. Then applying pressure to hide those truths on one end, and expose those truths at another, because after a little bit of work the entire system starts working for you and even in nations with dictatorial control would fall by virtue of the system eating itself... I don't think the KGB and FSB didn't take note of that. So you get to make a choice, is the bad stuff that happens that was revealed at the hands of Russia bad, or does it suddenly become good because "the enemy" exposed it?
Who said something has no baring on how true or untrue a statement is. Who advances a statement does not have bearing on how true or untrue it is. It can only give you indicators that it might be untrustworthy by virtue of who those people are and what lies they may or may not have told in the past. A liar can tell a truth and a truth teller can tell a lie. Either telling the truth is easy, and evidence will bear it out, telling a lie is hard because you constantly have to massage the lie to keep up the ruse.
