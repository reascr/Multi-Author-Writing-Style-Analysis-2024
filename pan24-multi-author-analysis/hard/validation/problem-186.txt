If you take what the article says she is saying at its word and assume it is meant in earnest - conditions in a DC jail and for being a traitor.
If you recognize the bullshit tactics and MO of people like Greene - because Pelosi is a Democrat and participated in holding the GQP and insurrectionists accountable.
The GQP has abandoned the concept of "reasonable" long ago. They don't feel the need to justify anything beyond "this will hurt people we don't like and energize the people who put us in power.".
Yeah. Not only do the remaining sane Republicans want a Speaker who isn't an idiot, but even some of those who might have supported him are not going to be happy that he's cutting so many deals with the crazy caucus that will hurt them in future elections.
There will probably be somebody who cuts a deal with those Republicans and Democrats to get their support as Speaker.
Yes, give Pelosi a great, big soapbox to stand on and a giant megaphone right in the face of the most craven Republicans. Great way for the Republicans to make even bigger fools of themselves than they already have.
Well it would make MTG look even more like a hypocrite than she already does - and that’s hard to do!
MTG would have to look into all of Congress’ insider trading. There’s nothing special about Pelosi. They all do it; they’re all allowed to do it. I think it’s wrong but, if you just investigate all of Congress, not just Pelosi, it’s purely political posturing that will bite you in the ass - hard.
