edit: reading further into it, i shouldnt have commented based on assumptions i dont know anything about, they did have a deal.
with the difference being that germany has settled their debts in treaties and such, i think japan never aknowledged their crimes?
I feel like Japan can learn from Germany on how to deal with its shameful WW2 actions. Stuff like banning organizations like Nippon Kaigi, removing the names of war criminals from Yasukuni Shrine, banning Imperial Japan symbols, etc.. The Germans have done all of this. Japan hasn't.
You shouldn't combine Germany and Japan together. The Japanese would do well by doing what the Germans did. Most Germans today will have no problems with condemning the Nazis. German politicians don't go to memorials that include Nazis, like the Japanese politicians do.
Where is the German equivalent? Where is the German equivalent for organizations like Nippon Kaigi which include major Japanese politicians as members?
Could've easily had an interesting discussion about the Nippon Kaigi and whether they inflate their membership, how influential their political campaigning is, etc.
Saying a lot of the Japanese government are members and the group has influence is dangerously close to things like "Illuminati/Jewish people/insert any group, rule the world". There just isn't anythung concrete to say it's true at all.
