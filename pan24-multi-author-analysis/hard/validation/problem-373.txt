Bruh, Football is probably THE most popular sport in the world. That's not even an over-exaggeration. It may not be that important in the US but the US isn't the entire world.
Here's the deal - Homophobia is a part and parcel of Islam. And that's the reason why it isn't tolerated in Islamic countries. I'm not trying to be Islamophobic or anything, just stating a fact.
I know Christianity frowns upon homosexuality as well, but the US, UK and other European Nations has a sizable chunk of people who are atheist/agnostic or practice other faiths so the rampant homophobia of years past is kind of dying down but practically speaking, you can't expect a country where the vast majority of people are Islamic to be tolerant to it.
There is overwhelming evidence that homosexuality in all its forms is strongly disliked in Middle Eastern countries, at least relative to the attitudes of Westerners in Western countries.
Try being more imaginative. Both of the stories are, at their core, people who broke the law in authoritarian countries a) knowing that they were breaking the law and could face punishment, and b) knowing that the country carries out draconian punishments. (Optional Similarity c) They are both from the US.).
Yup. Had some buddies in US SpecOps in Afghanistan. They told me that it was insanely difficult to deal with the tribal leaders, due to all the child sexual assault they committed and approved of. Stuff we actively suppress in other places, but weren't allowed to because "it's a cultural norm" for those POS'.
