MTG seems to be implying that the money should not go to Ukraine but should be given to struggling American families. What’s crazy is that republicans would never allow the money to be given to American citizens because these same people would scream socialism.
Republicans only approve two forms of Socialism: Free Money for Them and Free Money (in the form of Corporate Bailouts and Subsidies) for the Rich (their donors).
Correct, I'm involved in a project with backers who will readily accept credits for their benefit, profit from the program, and then turnaround and demand lower taxes for the wealthy. "Conservatism" is nothing more than a dressed up ideology for selfish motherfuckers.
That’s because you don’t know any real republicans, much less talk regularly to them, asshole. You drove the sane ones out of the party years ago, which is why your dad is 0-for in elections the past six years. The only “republicans” you hang with are the Lin Woods and Madge Greens and Roger Stones and Steve Bannons, outright nazis who took over the party.
