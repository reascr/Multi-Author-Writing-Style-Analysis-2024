That’s very obviously false, as that title unquestionably belongs to the former guy, but notice how Fox skirts liability by inserting a quote from a mouthpiece into the title to guide readers to their desired position. “No no, we’re not falsely claiming that Biden is the biggest serial liar elected, we’re just reporting on someone else who did. \ wink wink ”.
The headline implies that Biden is the "Biggest serial liar elected," which is patently false. President Biden would have to be lying at a rate of twenty-one lies per day to top . Fox knows this, which is why they had to quote someone else falsely calling Biden the "Biggest serial liar elected" instead of saying it themselves.
I think the biggest serial liar elected definitely goes to Trump, but it does appear that Biden made this story up. Both his father and his uncle died before he was elected Vice President in 2008.
The Problem: The President's father and the uncle he referred to both died several years before Biden took the office of Vice President.
On another note, it's interesting that the opposition (I hate to politicize the conversation, but this is not something friends do to friends) is twisting their neck 180 to ignore the obvious optic:
" You know, I — my dad, when I got elected Vice President, he said, “Joey, Uncle Frank fought in the Battle of the Bulge.” He was not feeling very well now — not because of the Battle of the Bulge. But he said, “And he won the Purple Heart. And he never received it. He never — he never got it. Do you think you could help him get it? We’ll surprise him.”So we got him the Purple Heart. He had won it in the Battle of the Bulge. And I remember he came over to the house, and I came out, and he said, “Present it to him, okay?” We had the family there.I said, “Uncle Frank, you won this. And I want to…” He said, “I don’t want the damn thing.” (Laughter.) No, I’m serious. He said, “I don’t want it.” I said, “What’s the matter, Uncle Frank? You earned it.” He said, “Yeah, but the others died. The others died. I lived. I don’t want it.”Just like a generation — this generation in Vietnam — excuse me, in — in Iraq.
One possible innocuous answer: It could be that Uncle Frank was wounded but for whatever reasons he did not earn / qualify for a purple heart.
