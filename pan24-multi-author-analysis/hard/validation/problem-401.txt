Bad thing. Black history? Just teach normal history and add things to the curiculum. Why does everything have to be racially motivated in the USA? They going to do indian history and hispanic history too now lmao?
I could fire that racism accusation right back at you. There is only one history. By filtering it based on race you just open the door to biases. Education in highschool is for giving people a strong basis. You can extend the curiculum to add more details on the history of african americans but it should be proportional. These kind of subjects are usually taught in college for a reason. If you only teach kids 'black history' they will get a verry narrow understanding of history from just that.
I think they’ve infuriated a lot more than African American Studies Professors. This is a New Coke level fuck up that teachers, principals, parents and high school students will never forget. It would have been smarter just to cancel the course.
They took out “intersectionality” out of AP Black History. I don’t even know how to respond to that. The College Board can go screw. Not really impressed they got on their high horse and tried to scold DeSantis and Florida, they colluded with these fuckos and got caught. Assholes.
