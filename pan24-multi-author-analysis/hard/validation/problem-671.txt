And then I ended up in the Deep South in the 7th grade and witnessed--easily--the majority of my public school class in rural Mississippi completely NOT understand sex. They were vulgarly open about the gossip and salaciousness of it, but pig fucking ignorant about it.
Absurd things like how women get pregnant or not. How fetuses develop and when. What even IS menstruation (I recall it wasn't until 9th grade when I found out that none of my male friends had any idea what was actually happening there--zero clue, just "women bleed monthly because of puberty"). What erections are and aren't. How they happen. De-mystified basic stuff.
I knew what periods were before the girls in my class would start having them. How humans procreated before I was biologically able to. It made the transition to puberty something I was pretty informed of by the time it hit.
I started puberty and my period at age 9. Which is when my mom sat me down with a medical book of diagrams and explained some basic things to me. 7th grade is insanely late to even start talking about things.
