I really want them to vote on the 30% consumption tax now because the CBO would have to score it, and show (once again) how stupid the Republican think tanks are.
Given the shit show that was the election of the Speaker there's more than one Republican dumb enough to cause a default simply because they want to be the center of attention.
the thing is if you let them reap the consequences and republicans are at fault, they will never admit it and you know damn well their propaganda right wing media machine will tell their bad faith viewers it was the democrats fault entirely and all they wanted to do is be fiscally responsible.
then despite hundreds of articles proving it was republicans who let us default, that wonâ€™t change the minds of the idiots who take the lies from fox at face value and continue to parrot the talking point even if every single real news organization in the world will point that it was republicans who let us default.
At this point, I doubt it; you'd want the media to be blaming the GOP for this pointless game and threatening to shut down the government and take money away from workers, crash the economy, and wipe out everyone's 401k and retirement, but the media focuses on "debt ceiling showdown', like it's entertainment.
Advertisements in the newspaper/magazines they read? Commercials during shows they are known to watch? Basically, wherever their eyes go, they should see negative coverage of the GOP debt ceiling debacle. Put it right outside their local office, their home, and their DC office.
Maybe not their home... remember Mitch McConnell whining a few years ago about protestors outside his Kentucky home? They've said that is not fair game and they don't like it.
Honestly, if want to get the message out and move past it, probably people need to just group up and pool money for billboards across DC, government employee heavy districts, and competitive districts (especially republican held). If all McCarthy and his ilk see everywhere they go, are billboards bashing them, they will likely cave.
