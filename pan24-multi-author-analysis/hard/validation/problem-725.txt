This was a confessional seat near nyc. The Democratic Party failed in their oppo research and the local papers of record from the New York Times on down missed the boat.
Are dems supposed to expect republicans to do the right thing? We know they won’t. Some of them support straight up insurrectionists. The folks in charge of opo research for the area and the people in charge of the local party apparatus need to go if this is the level of competence.
The Democratic Party needs to win elections. Missing crap like this in a competitive seat isn’t conducive to winning elections. This could have been another dem seat!
The republicans should have vetted their candidate. But good god what were the papers and the opo research folks doing? We were sweating about the closest margins in this election and they missed this?
I was hearing this for the weeks leading up to the election. NY was a shit show, NY could single-handedly flip the house. While most of the country disregarded the racist southern strategy flogging the issue of "inner city crime", that plus inflation made big inroads in NY.
