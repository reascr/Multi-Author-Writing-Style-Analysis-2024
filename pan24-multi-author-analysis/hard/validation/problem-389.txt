That's entirely on Russia. If they withdrew peacefully then we'd likely see them trying to sell more arms to ukraine especially since they have a valid reason for buying them. If Russia escalated to nukes them all bets off for the response. Nukes are the troubling part of course. However I'm just saying that this is the rare time that dems are doing the right thing in sending arms, not us troops, and it happens to favor the military industrial complex to the point that it's now the corruption that probably pushing the Republicans onto the correct path of support ukraine.
Most of the Republicans I see either casually dismiss Ukraine's issues and talk about spending (even if they claim to show sympathy for Ukrainians) or say Ukraine is corrupt and we shouldn't have any sympathy for them, and say either A) "not rooting for either Russia or Ukraine" or B) are full-blown Russia supporters.
And the handful of Republicans who have said they support Ukraine are all serial liars and people who have at best stood by silently when their party's done horrible things and at worst cheered those horrible things on, so nobody should doubt for a second that any Republican would turn their back on Ukrainians the second they thought it would serve their own goals regardless of what empty platitudes they throw out to the press when it's convenient.
