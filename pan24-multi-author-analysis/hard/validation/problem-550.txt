The Thirteenth Amendment forbade slavery and involuntary servitude, “except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”.
Oh Come on, there is a huge difference between slavery and involuntary servitude as criminal punishment. Having inmates clean up road sides is a reasonable and fair punishment.
Slavery is when someone owns a person as property. This bill is talking about labor as punishment for inmates or public service. Cleaning up the sides of the road.
1. The condition in which one person is owned as property by another and is under the owner's control, especially in involuntary servitude.
the enslaving and owning of human beings and their offspring as property, able to be bought, sold, and forced to work without wages, as distinguished from other systems of forced, unpaid, or low-wage labor also considered to be slavery.
tldr: slavery is a broad blanket term which covers a variety of practices, of which chattel slavery is a particular one. Forced/unpaid prison labour as a punishment is also slavery.
no, slavery is the practice of compelling someone to work without proper compensation. What you're referring to is chattel slavery, the most common type practiced in the US at least, whereby the slaves exist as a form of transferable property that legally belong to whoever has bought them.
Obviously it's not "kidnap African people and force them into slavery on a plantation", but it's 'modern' slavery. And it is constitutionally slavery. Even the people back when the 13th amendment was being written considered it slavery enough to include it in the Constitution as an exception.
Prisoners should have a right to be able to choose to find jobs, in fact in an ideal world that could even be good (helping prisoners reintegrate back into society, find work after their imprisonment, and just make money while in-prison). But forced prison labor for no payment or very little payment is horrible and should be considered slavery.
