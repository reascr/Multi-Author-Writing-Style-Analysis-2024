They appear to be a failed state already. Take away the rocket, and now ICBM attacks and I’m just not sure it’s anything other than shoddy or unbelievable saber rattling.
IMO that's because our doctrine no longer relies on artillery; we simply bomb that shit to oblivion from the air. I don't know of a single country that can match the US in air power, not even close. The in the world based on TrueValueRating (not just number of aircraft) are, in order:
IMO, the US doesn't need to change tactics because its doctrine is already far superior to that of countries like Russia, who still rely on infantry and artillery. I can't imagine any conflict the US would get into in which we would even need a huge ground assault force, because we have so many other options before we even get to that point.
In a full scale conflict “just call an F-16” can’t be the solution to all tactical problems, there won’t be enough to go around.
Which is something that is possible in the sort of small wars we’ve been fighting, against enemies with no air power or air defense of their own.
The US also hasn't been against any enemy that has extremely good air defense. Russia theoretically does simply by number of S300 and S400 systems. As does china. Which is why you see US AirPower have two distinct forms nowadays: long range stealth aircraft and new surgical CAS systems. With the logic, similar to the gulf war, of using the long range stealth bombers in combination with cruise missiles to take out those anti air capabilities.
Yeah, from my limited research our new generation bombers and fighters have weapons capable of destroying most anti air defenses before the enemy can actually lock on. They may be able to detect but can't do much before we are able to fire our missiles.
