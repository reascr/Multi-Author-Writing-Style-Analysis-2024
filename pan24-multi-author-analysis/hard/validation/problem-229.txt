Something I do find myself wondering though is why, if US intelligence has been aware of the passing of these balloons on a more or less routine basis, they decided to make a public spectacle of this one at this time?
But NORAD is saying that although they can go back and look at the data now to determine that 3 balloons passed during the Trump administration, there was no awareness of the craft at the time.
Possible. The Guardian article at the top of the subreddit right now says the pentagon was aware of 3 during the Trump administration, and a 4th one early in the Biden administration. This is at least the 5th detected balloon.
A balloon isn't that easy to detect. The radar return won't be all that strong and a slow target might be missed if Moving Target Indication (MTI) processing is used to avoid detecting birds or ground clutter. There is also the problem of distinguishing a threat from legitimate weather balloons.
People envision these balloons like they're a helium party balloon, but they're really not. They're pretty loosely inflated, just buoyant enough to stay afloat. Punching tiny holes, like a bullet, doesn't make them pop.
