Right for this specific package it is. But the majority of everything we sent is not. The US is more focused on military aid than economic in the grand scheme.
It's been weapons and supplies the whole time and mind you the equipment is mostly from pre 2000's Era. All of this equipment would have otherwise rotted in our reserves. The EU is handling Ukraines financials and the US is handing physical equipment. There's a good thread below that gives quite a good breakdown of western aid to Ukraine.
Don’t get me wrong: Ukraine needs aid to survive and win this war. But, with how much we spend in defense, we’re really neglecting our own people unnecessarily.
Society in general has to spend outrageous amounts of money to handle the small % of the population that doesn't want to behave as expected.
They're getting the money either way. This particular instance just means the equipment gets to serve a purpose rather then filling up a warehouse.
The only way to maintain the ability to produce these things is to just keep making them, even when they're not needed right away.
