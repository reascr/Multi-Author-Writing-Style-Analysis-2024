if you mean places like a Cairo or Luxor it's safe but I would suggest you to have some guide with you, you will learn more (stories) about these places with historical perspective.
Go to Luxor, Aswan, Sharm Al Sheikh, Hurghada & Alexandria, these are relatively safe and u will have quite a lot of fun.
Lots of people, way too crowded even for un-touristic spots, scammers everywhere, if you have a camera and tried to take some pictures it will be confiscated by police, just don’t go to Cairo.
Also, while I haven’t been myself, every time I’ve ever listened to someone talk about Cairo, they always claim it’s the worst place they’ve ever been for scammers and street guys harassing you everywhere you go.
Mostly safe on the average for western tourists, but in countries like that you just never know when some shit might go down. Very unpredictable in many ways.
That’s why a guide is recommended. They will shoo those people away from you. The guides you can hire will apparently work very hard for you, I’ve heard they are very dedicated to their jobs and in giving you a good trip. And they work hard for a good tip too.
