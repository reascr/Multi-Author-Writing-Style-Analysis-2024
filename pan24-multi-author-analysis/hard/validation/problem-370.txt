Ukraine is valuable land. Rich in resources and agriculture. Putin doesn't care about military losses and will keep throwing bodies at it hoping he can win a battle of attrition with UKR forces or until NATO countries tire of arming Ukraine. Which they wont. The military industrial complex thrives on this type of open ended conflict. Since Russia and Ukraine share a border this won't end soon. Russia will keep up "special operations" indefinitely in order to disqualify Ukraine from NATO membership. They will roll out more tanks and send more men into the grinder until Putin shuffles off this mortal coil.
