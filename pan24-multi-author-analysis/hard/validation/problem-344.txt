I remember hearing anti-Democratic rhetoric in Evangelical churches in the 1980s, so it's not that new.
They were very specific that "the people shouldn't pick the leaders, only God has the power to do that," and reinforcing it by saying that Kings were more biblical than Presidents.
"The Media" did do the job that they were paid to do. "The Media" is a small collection of corporations that own all the various different outlets. That small collection of corporations have owners. Those owners are among the very same oligarchs that want to eliminate Democracy and replace it with a figurehead authoritarian dictator that they control.
They're the shrinking minority so they have to manipulate and carve up a democracy designed for majority rule. Gerrymandering was the first step to at least give them the chance to control some legislatures and the house. Next was controlling SCOTUS no matter how obviously ethical and possibly criminal their actions would be. McConnell wanted SCOTUS not for the evangelicals but to keep the GOP in power in whatever ways he could seize. Donors for the GOP and corporations and the wealthy demanded McConnell thwart the growing majority of the democrats.
