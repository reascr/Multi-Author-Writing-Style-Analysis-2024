Yup, entire thing has been. TBH I seen Greenpeace often putting out total bullshit just to fuel outrage as well and it's infuriating. We still need coal for steel production, so we might as well source it locally.
Even though it's to be used for steel production, this coal is still going to be responsible for a shitload of greenhouse gas emissions.
The UK, and europe as a whole, needs to move away from carbon intensive steelmaking in the next decade or two. That will likely mean a shift to steel made from hydrogen reduction. This mine is expected to keep operating until 2049. So it will end up shipping its coal all over the world, to whichever countries are still happy to pump out CO2 by then.
It is bad, if we want to stop importing coal then we should, why are we exporting it if we claim the boats importing coal for us is anti green and needed to be stopped... It's illogical to then do the very thing we said is bad and call it good.
It's also conveniently being setup so 85% of the coal will be exported , this has no logic in being done as it won't be used for its primary purpose and is just for money.
This coal mine is being said to use for steel in the UK but UK Steel has said no it won't be used as they are moving to green alternatives and actually 85% of the coal will be exported which is purely for money and not a requirement to stop using russian coal.
B) thereâ€™s support for a backward step to produce coal, 80% of which is expected to be exported and contribute to the carbon output of the UK, against the trend of steel production around NOT using coking coal in its process.
