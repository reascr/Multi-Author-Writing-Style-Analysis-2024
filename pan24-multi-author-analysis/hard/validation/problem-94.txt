Get rid of the gerrymandering that turned some potentially competitive seats into protected Republican seats and we'd already be saying "Speaker Jeffries".
And then after they elect that speaker, a few GOP members change their mind about the speaker for not getting assigned to their promised committees and then vote to replace them, along with the Democrats.
What \will\ teach them that gerrymandering is bad is if Democrats get into a position to redistrict to favor them instead, and that's completely fair game at this point as far as I'm concerned.
Somewhat less likely befeficial scenario: McCarthy trades away some consessions to the Democrats, for enough Democrats to vote "Present", so that McCarthy can get the necessary majority.
However, the Democrats have no reason they should want to help McCarthy, and they have absolutely no reason to trust the Republicans to uphold promises over time. The deal will have to be something tangible which they can receive immediately, such as being granted chairmanship of committess, which would essentially leave the entire sphere of governance out of Republican hands for the next two years, in the case where they give the Democrats the tie-breaking vote in a committee, essentially putting it under their full control.
Very unprobable scenario: Fed up with complete deadlock, some moderate Republican decides to change his party affiliation from Republican to Independent. This would require someone who feels they have a chance to actually get elected as an independent candidate in the next elections, otherwise it would be career suicide, because they would be running against both a Democrat, and a Republican who had a camaign funding fuelled by petty vengance. I can't think of anyone who has the balls, nor the means to do this.
