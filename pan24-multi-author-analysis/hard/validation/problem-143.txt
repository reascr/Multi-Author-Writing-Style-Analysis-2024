The glad-handing behavior by telling content creators what they can and can’t do via threatening their livelihood is bad. If it’s not harassment, calls to action for violence, or porn YouTube should stay out of it. Advertisers have to advertise on YouTube. It’s the biggest video platform on the internet. Advertisement is a numbers game. As long as people watch YouTube creators, ad space will be bought. But, if creators are so bogged down with stupid rules that try to make sure everyone is a sanitized, milquetoast employee of weenie hut junior’s, people will stop watching. We are human, we want to watch people who are their genuine self, not some corpo’d watered down version of who someone is.
Swearing is ok. Talking about sensitive subjects is ok. Being someone who doesn’t conform to the mainstream is ok. Being your honest, authentic self is ok. Dissent is ok. If YouTube continues to dangle monetization over creators heads unless they conform, the content will get worse and worse until creators stop creating because they can’t be themselves, and we’ll stop watching because we can tell when someone is being a phony.
we're at a point where youtubers censor themself while talking or say "oh i can't say what i wanted to say because otherwise i get demonetized" or "F....aaantastic!". its so extreme that it is annoying to hear everytime "oh i can't say what i wanted to say otherwise i get censored" etc.. you can't watch videos anymore without hearing it again and again. and as a youtuber its hell to always find out what the reason for it is this time. youtube don't tells you its exact rules and things you need to look out for, so you have to try and experiment for countless hours to find out what the problem is by editing your video to death. it sucks.
i agree with you, some people over-do it. in such cases i think it is okay to prevent children from seeing it (i mean, youtube has a age restricted video feature for a reason). but even if you're an adult and verify your age.. youtube still censors it. they could just restrict such videos (who have TOO much swearing in them.. like 20-50+ in a 10min video or something like that) so only adults can watch them or similiar. but treating adults like they are children who need to get "protected" from "evil things" is just dumb.
