Erdogan is trying to extort from both NATO and Russia. He apparently thinks that his Security is up to the task of protecting him from Putin's inevitable ire when Sweden and Finland get in.
And YOU realize that Putin regards Finland's membership into NATO as a threat--when he hasn't threatened Finland, right??
Ridiculous, and patently unrealistic. Riddle me this: if Putin's army is on the ropes from what was supposed to be a "quick" Ukraine invasion: then how's he supposed to invade several other countries, simultaneously?? And even assuming Putin thought he could bully the world through nuclear blackmail: what's to stop NATO, et al, from covertly supplying these invaded nations--just as they're doing with Ukraine?
If you can't see that NATO is part of the problem (exaggerated by Putin; but still a big thorn to peace), dunno what to tell you.
Had Ukraine been allowed to join NATO there wouldn't have been a war in Ukraine to begin with, just like Sweden and Finland won't have to worry about Russian aggression from now on.
In either case, the assumption you are making is that because Russia is finding out their military is not up to even Soviet standards that somehow that means they aren't a threat to any of their neighbors. Leaving aside they are still a nuclear power, it wouldn't take much to actual revamp their military, learn from their past mistakes and use all their oil money to become the military power that they mistakenly thought they were in the first place. And then there is the fact that they went in alone, but that won't necessarily always be true. What do you think say a Russian-Chinese alliance could pull off for example? Believing that a country is safe from a warmongering autocratic neighbor without having allies to protect your back is the height of stupidity.
