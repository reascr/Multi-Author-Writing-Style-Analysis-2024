With all respect to zelensky though, it’s not necessarily even our fight against Russia at all. From my understanding too, sanctions and shit have already been in place for a while, we can tell Russia this isn’t okay but NATO and the US or whatever else is going to keep wanting to press the buttons and push it until it’s now Russia vs USA from instigating back and forth nonstop.
Yeah you're missing a lot of context but Ukraine wanted into NATO (to protect against Russian aggression) but Russia said it was a red line for them (since they were planning to take Ukraine since before 2014) so in order to placate Russia NATO denied Ukraine membership. Then Russia invaded in 2014. The world looked the other way and again tried to appease Russia until they invaded again in 2022.
As for it not being NATO's fight, I suppose it's not technically. But the last time the western world just let an adversarial European nation run roughshod over allied European nations was in the 1930s when Hitler started annexing countries left right and centre. Pacification only encouraged Hitler to take more and more. Thankfully Western countries didn't let it happen this time around.
Surely you believe that there is more the west could do that wouldn’t trigger widespread unrest. Or is it your opinion that the west is so close to widespread collapse that individuals making the personal choice to travel less and use less fuel will trigger mass rioting?
Millions of people are displaced and hundreds of thousands are dead and we are still traveling for the holidays and enjoying nice toasty homes. The West’s aid is very high, but the west’s sacrifice is very low.
