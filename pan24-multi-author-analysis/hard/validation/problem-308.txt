On any topic relating to the U.S. - Canada relationship it is common for some Canadian people go on about "closest ally," "shared boarder," "largest trading partner," etc to prove whatever point they are trying to make. They seem to be emotionally attached which is causing them to read too much into any topic relating to the U.S. and Canada relationship. It is bothering that specific group of Canadians that Biden didn't visit Canada first.
I really don't think Biden and his team of advisors and the entire whitehouse staff forgot it's tradition to visit Canada first. Hmmmm I wonder if something happened the last couple years that might have had Biden's team want to curtail unnecessary travel... especially during his first year in office when the pandemic was still more of a top of mind concern.
It's far more likely the pandemic played a roll than some sort of institutional memory issue, it's not like our geopolitical interests were rapidly diverging and he needed to shore up a shaky ally, we're still up here. Biden was VP when Obama visited, he's been here before and probably figured why risk it at the time.
I feel like you're just way overthinking it and looking past the most likely explanation, the pandemic derailed his travel plans and this was the first time it got slotted it. The most obvious explanation is usually correct and "oh ya COVID was much more of a thing then, probably delayed the trip" is far more likely than some institutional memory issue.
I'm not saying it's some super important thing the Whitehouse is uber passionate about but 40 years until Trump is a pretty good run. I bet some of the same team that was with Obama is with Biden, nobody magically forget, their entire job is not to forget things like that.
As per another comment - it really doesn't bother me that Biden is going elsewhere first. Or really anyone I know. It would however bother quite a lot of people if he DIDNT visit Canada at all during his term. Whether intentional or not, that would send a really negative message to a very close ally & partner.
