How can you say “for no reason”? There’s literally a video of her helping to break a window & then start climbing through it right in front of an officer telling her not to do it.
But when someone breaks through multiple barricades and cordons and police lines and through doors to get into the Capitol, well that person...well that person is just an innocent bystander.
I've always held that capitol police should've shot anyone who crossed through a broken window or door into the Capitol Building while congress was in session and the VP was in the building. The common response to this line of thought on reddit is usually something along the lines of, "the crowd would have become enraged and swarmed them" but I disagree. Hell, we have video proof that as soon as Babbit was shot that crowd dissipated and no one else tried to climb through the window. I absolutely believe a few dozen bodies (and I don't think it would've taken that many) would have backed that crowd off immediately. I also believe that as soon as capitol police started firing it would've prompted faster response times from other law enforcement groups.
I think you're giving Trump way too much credit here but I'll admit this is the first time I've heard this idea.
I was talking about Trump for the first time in awhile about that NFT bs. Then I felt like an idiot after realizing that I was fulfilling his desire for attention.
