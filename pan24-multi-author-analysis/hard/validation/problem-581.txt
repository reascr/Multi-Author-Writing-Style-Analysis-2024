If you could prove that it's a clear and present danger, you could make the argument that it's too harmful to be permitted. One can't prove that, because it's not true, but Republicans are no longer even pretending to participate in good faith governance.
The average Republican voter has been completely immersed in Murdoch propaganda for over 20 years now and many of them have moved on to more insidious outlets. Their critical thinking skills have been, to put it mildly, blunted. This doesn't mean they're not culpable for their shitty voting choices, but it does mean that society as a whole needs to do something about virulent propaganda.
Of course they would still preach it just like they preach that dems are really the party trying to disenfranchise black voters, but in the case of guns, they're at least partly right.
I am almost at the point of willing to believe that gun control is a Republican plot to retain power by scaring their base. Iâ€™ve said it for years and will continue to say it until something changes: if dems kept every single policy position but stopped with the gun control and actually embraced the 2nd amendment, they would probably never lose another national election, and could actually enact all of the other great stuff they want with little trouble. Legalize weed too, and their dominance would be assured. But nooooo.
No. Not even then. Reagan is the one that passed most of the gun laws in California when black people started to arm themselves for protection.
