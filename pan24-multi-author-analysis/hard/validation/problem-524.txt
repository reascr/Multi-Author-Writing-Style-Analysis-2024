The more fair comparison is not OIF and OEF, but the first gulf war. OIF and OEF were mostly fought against insurgent type forces and not organized militaries. Ukraine isn't a hodgepodge of insurgents, they are a standing military nation backed by a government. Desert Storm was the US lead coalition versus the standing Iraqi army. At the time, Iraq was supposed to have the 4th largest army in the world behind the big 3 super powers of the US, Russia, and China, and they were battle hardened after wars with Iran and an invasion of Kuwait. The coalition absolutely mopped the floor with the Iraqi army. There was never a question of who had air superiority and the US defeated the elite Republican Guard in less than a day during the Battle of 73 Easting. The whole ground war was pretty much over in less than 100 hours. You can read the official details of each movement . That's the war Russia expected to conduct, but they found out very quickly that they were not the US and their allies.
We gonna have to prepare for a long haul as russians are fully ready to die by the millions for no fckin reason or simply because TV said so.
The Ukrainian half of me still believes and hopes for the best and an end to the meaningless bloodshed, but as we all know life ain't sunshine and rainbows and the number of dead will grow higher by the day.
What's even more disgusting is that russians don't give a flying fuck about the dead and are happy to see another couple hundred thousand dead.
What is it with Russians and just throwing bodies into the meat grinder and hope that the other guys can’t kill them fast enough before they lose? Furthermore, what is it with old Soviet societies and just chucking piles of people at a problem and hope it gets better? Or does having some inane “Warrior mindset” philosophy mean you also have to be dumb as pig shit, too.
Kids take years to grow up. In the meantime, they’ve imported a number of furious Ukrainian prisoners of war who, if I were them, will be holding a grudge and look for any opportunity fuck Russia up. Kind of like how Jews forced to work in Nazi factories would often sabotage bombs, guns, ammunition, etc.
