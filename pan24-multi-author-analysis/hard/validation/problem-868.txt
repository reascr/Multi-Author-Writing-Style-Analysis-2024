>The resolution first passed the Senate in March, along party lines. When it came up again last month, it passed 61-37, with support from 12 Democrats.
It went through the senate with 61 votes. So just enough to kill a filibuster. But next session fetterman takes away an R seat, and so if even 1 person changed their mind it won't even be filibuster proof let alone veto proof.
Why does he need to convince congress of that? Hes within his rights as president to Veto. If anything its Mitch McConnells and McCarthys jobs to try and get a veto proof majority.
I’m confused in order to veto something doesn’t it have to pass both the house and the senate both of which are currently controlled by the democrats?
Ohh, does this mean that the Republicans will lead an effort to override the veto and then blame the ill effects of this passing on Biden down the road?
I added in an edit just now to explain because I guess I wasn't clear, but I wasn't saying that it would be overridden, just referencing the time the GOP did exactly that to Obama.
