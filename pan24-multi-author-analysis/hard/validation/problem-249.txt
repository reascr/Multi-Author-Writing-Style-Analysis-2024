Sorry, not assumptions. Evidence from other nations that have guns but also have regulations shows it’s true. It’s possible to have guns, have gun regulation, and also reduce gun violence.
Then why do other countries who have gun controls but also have similar mental health issues not have mass shootings??? Banning all guns is not the answer. Gun control is.
Gun control laws do not work in the US for a myriad of reasons. There are too many guns out there. Substantive gun control is always struck down as unconstitutional. Lately, any new gun control laws don't even address the problem (I don't believe any mass shooting has been perpetrated by a "ghost gun").
None of which, of course, have any bearing on mass shootings (no mass shooter has ever used a so-called “ghost” gun, and Colorado banned so-called high capacity magazines on 2013 under the promise that would curtail mass shootings).
If the claim is that banning “ghost” guns and so-called high capacity magazines will somehow reduce gun violence, put it in writing and agree to repeal the law in 5 years when it’s shown to have no effect.
All laws should have automatic repeal. They need to stipulate, as part of the law, exactly the intended outcome and exactly the expected costs. After 5 years, if they haven’t achieved the outcome, or they’ve exceeded the cost by 20% or more, it automatically is repealed.
