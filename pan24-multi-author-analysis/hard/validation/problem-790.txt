I don't know the situation but from the same article, locals living near the park are getting caught in the effort. I would imagine not everyone is aware of the defined borders of the park and people may be getting shot for simply being in the wrong area.
Not as simple as that, the article goes into detail how the borders of the park aren't clearly defined and innocent people have been shot/killed, including a 7 y.o kid and another kid with mental disabilities. This is also besides the fact that a lot of the people who've been killed have never been identified (or had any forensics work done) so dubious if they were poachers in the first place.
Poachers and their motivations are not monolithic, but the nature and scope of the crime/society they're operating in has led to being shot on sight by those tasked with stopping them.
We probably shouldn’t forget that poachers are specifically there to kill things, and will sometimes kill anything in their way. They aren’t there to pick flowers.
They are extremely dangerous by default. Shooting on sight just makes sense for the safety of anyone who isn’t a poacher.
