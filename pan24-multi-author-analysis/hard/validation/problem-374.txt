The term "battle tank" means a self-propelled armoured fighting vehicle, capable of heavy firepower, primarily of a high muzzle velocity direct fire main gun necessary to engage armoured and other targets, with high cross-country mobility, with a high level of self-protection, and which is not designed and equipped primarily to transport combat troops. Such armoured vehicles serve as the principal weapon system of ground-force tank and other armoured formations.
To summarize - In English everything is a fighting vehicule and only the tank is armored. In German everything is armored but only the tank is a fighting vehicule.
A tank in german is panzerkampfwagen, so an armored fighting vehicule. Aka an AFV or an english tank.
Consider panzer means armored, not tank. A panzerschiff is a type of warship, a panzerhaubitze is a self propelled artillery piece.
The thing is that in german, almost all armoured vehicles are called "Panzer". If you look up the entry for "Panzer" in the dictionary, it says "tanks". In German, the thing being sent is indeed a "tank".
These are all tanks to an average german. Different roles, but all tanks. The Leopard 2 is a "Kampfpanzer", literally "battle tank".
And there really isn't much point in trying to argue that that the term in a German publication is wrong and that those aren't tanks, because thats not what a huge part of the german population would tell you if you polled them about it, e.g. showed them the image of a Marder. If you asked them if thats a tank, almost everyone will say "yes". Because to us, it obviously is a "Panzer".
Most people I know can distinguish between the German words "Panzer" and the English "tank". (I am german) A journalist should certainly.
