We got more than half the population in some states banned from obtaining safe and effective health care services, classrooms where they've just removed every book for fear of persecution under newly passed laws if someone disapproves, they're trying to skirt around freedom of speech laws by making certain speech defamatory regardless whether or not it's true, politicians are out there trying to decide whether our kids have to have their genitals examined to be allowed to play sports, this thread is about a report on an attempt to ban entertainment they don't approve of, in Florida, if a business says something the governor doesn't like, he uses state power to punish it.
