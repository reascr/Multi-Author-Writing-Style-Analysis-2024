I don't think these people read the article and realize it was a PI and not a tracker installed by the government. I assumed it was a government car with a tracker too until I actually clicked the link.
If you’re going to put a tracking device on a elected official vehicle maybe don’t make it easy to track you down? Now his life is fucked because he’s going to lose that Cabelas job and he’s going to lose his PI license.
I would guess the guy just lost his PI license, at the least. Probably a lot engage in this sort of stuff and don't get caught, although I'm not sure how someone would actually be able to use the info in a civil or criminal case since to do so would, in some places, effectively be an admission to a crime.
I get that. I'm sure that there are plenty of ways to incorporate illegally-obtained info without directly tying-in to how the info was gathered, if ethics are thrown out the window.
The point of parallel construction is that they you'll never know the illegally obtained information exists. It's never presented as evidence.
Example: illegal warrantless GPS tracker on your car shows you going to a storage unit in the middle of the night several times a week. Police now spend the resources to do a perfectly legal stake out at the times you normally go to that storage unit. They follow you and get enough probable cause to get a legal warrant to search the storage unit and find evidence of a crime.
Without the illegal tracker they never would have found the storage unit without spending way more resources to keep surveillance on you 24/7. But the courts will never know about that tracker.
