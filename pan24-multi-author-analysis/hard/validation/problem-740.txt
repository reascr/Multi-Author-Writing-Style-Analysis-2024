They’re not gonna execute 15,000 people. They simply don’t have the means to do so, nor would the population and other countries just tolerate it. They’re using this as a justification to mass execute the more vocal protesters/leaders and to let other protesters know that they could be next if they don’t step back.
Perhaps, but the main takeaway would be an event like a mass execution of innocent civilians could easily be used a prelude to war/invasion and get a lot of support.
Yeah but use your brain for a second and look into what created the circumstances for those genocides or mass executions to even be possible. Killing 15,000 people is a big ask, who is going to dish it out? If you are using soldiers and bullets you have the nazi problem: How do you handle the moral apprehension of people killing 15000 HUMAN BEINGS no different than their executioner besides circumstance. There is a reason why the nazis switched to chemical means of executing their prisoners.
Yeah like, the nazis were fighting almost the entire world yet still had the time and ressourcen to commit the holocaust and other crimes. As awful as it sounds but 15000 people is probably on the "easier" end of mass murder commited by regimes....
Would they get away with it if they publicly executed 15,000 people in the town square? Probably not, this is not the Middle Ages anymore nor are they Genghis Khan. I know this type of shit happened in Srebrenica for instance, but the situation is a bit different now. There’s no war and they’re killing their own population. If you kill 15,000 people you will have at least 10,000 very pissed off families and many many more people who were friends with these people. They’d have to turn into NK in order to maintain power after that and I don’t think the population would tolerate that. But you know what, if they actually do kill 15,000 people, that might just be the event that finally toppled this insane regime.
15,000 people is maybe not a lot in the world of some of the worst mass executions, but it's still a fuck ton of people.
And if you decide the chemical approach: how do they get enough chemicals to kill 15000 people? Who is going to sell you it with all the sanctions Iran already has on them, plus any global pressure not to aid in these executions.
