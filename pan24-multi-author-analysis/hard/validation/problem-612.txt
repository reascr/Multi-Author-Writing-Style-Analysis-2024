I would imagine there are numerous communities across the world where this kind of thing takes place. Not just religions of course but any strong tribalism that takes root. It can and does exist at varying levels throughout society and it is undesirable in all of them imo.
I dont know that it would even be a correct ruling. Being gay isnt different than being black. If you cant discriminate on one, you cant on the either regardless of your personal religious doctrine. Those things are interchangeable here.
Your freedom of religion means you get to be free of persecution and discrimination based on your religion. Gay people getting married doesnt infringe on anything. It does not mean you can discriminate because of your religion.
Descrimination based on your personal beliefs is still discrimination no matter how you try to justify it.
Discrimination and religious liberty are not the same thing. And the one being targeted in this case is the party trying to exercise their religious liberty.
If you say I can, it's infringing on his religious liberties. If you say I cannot, then he's free to exercise his religious liberties.
