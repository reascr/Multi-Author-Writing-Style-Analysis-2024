1. Capture Bakhmut at all costs (even though it'd just be another Mariupol-style destroyed city with no value by the end of it.).
3. Use that as propaganda cover for withdrawing from parts of the Kherson and Zap oblasts (I suspect, west of Oleski/Crimea Water Canal, and north of Nova Kakhovka/M14 road, which would include giving up the ZNPP.).
2. Push back Ukraine from the outskirts of Donetsk/Luhansk, to ensure major Russian-held cities are out of range of Ukrainian artillery. This was a goal from day 1, but the Ukrainian defenses along the Toretsk-Avdiivka-Mariinka line have proved virtually impenetrable. The fall of Bakhmut might provide encirclement opportunities, or at least flanking pressure that could make Ukraine withdraw from their most fortified positions in the entire war. I don't think Russia has any steam left to take Slovyansk/Kramatorsk, their current goal is a border lying somewhere roughly equally between Donetsk/Luhansk and those cities.
Not saying Putin would manage to accomplish that (Ukraine has a good chance of pushing Russia out of the entire Kherson and Zap oblasts, all the way to the Crimean border), but these I think are the current plans.
Pretty sure Svatove is the new Kherson where they do a protracted interdiction campaign that doesn't capture much territory but degrades the Russians to the point they pull out all at once.
This is all about the promotion of Yevgeny Prigozhin, and its seemingly telling that no one within the Russian command structure has been able to resist the move and point out how strategically insignificant it is. Presumably Putin has signed off on it too, which makes me wonder if he's concerned a bit as well. can't afford to alienate Prigozhin.
