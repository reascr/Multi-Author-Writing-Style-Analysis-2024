Oh man, I love when Trump lovers try to pretend they know what's going on. The regulations (multiple) that were dropped during his presidency allowed the state to relax safety regulations on trains.
So yes, the regulation regarding train breaks would not have specifically helped. However it paired with the regular safety audits that were cut as part of different regulation likely would have.
So yea, no matter how bad it makes you feel, this is because of a Trump admin decision. Nice try though.
Edit: The politifact article you posted is resting on a technicality. The regulations wouldn't have applied because it wasn't classified as carrying dangerous cargo, which is an extremely narrow definition. One of the regulations that would have likely gotten this train reclassified would have been the required safety audits that were dropped along with the break requirements.
The regulation that was dropped during his tenure would not, in any way, have impacted the train derailment in Ohio.
Since the NTSB isn't making the link and you are, let's see your documentation and justification about the cause and how it relates to specific Trump regulation changes.
Oh how fun. I'm not anything remotely related to a Trump lover and would be absolutely be relieved if he was indicted and could be removed from politics overall. But the NTSB has specifically stated that Trump's regulation changes did not impact the derailment.
So you have no regulations to point to that Trump cut that specifically impacted the derailment. You also don't have any specific state regulations that were relaxed directly because of a Trump action. But, but but, if the brake regulation hadn't been cut and if more regulations that were never enacted... specifically ones that were previously excluded from the actual regulation during previous administrations... if those were enacted, then it might have maybe been different.
