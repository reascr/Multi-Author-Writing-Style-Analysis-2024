There is a rage that builds inside me every time something like this happens. Every fucking time, all you see and hear is an innocent person pleading for their life and some piece of shit cops acting like it's just another day at the office. I have no place to put the rage I feel right now. I'm going to sleep. I hope those cops get what they deserve.
Thats why people insist that all cops are bastards. because the ones that did the killing and the ones that didn't do anything to stop it.
out of all of the folks that were standing around, not a single one prevented their fellow blue line brothers from beating a man to death.
The police standing by to prevent anyone from stopping them murdering a man AGAIN. this is the savage sequel of george floyd and so many before him, and the thin blue line will make sure it happens again unless something more powerful forces a change.
you get it. you aren't missing anything. the ones that did the murder get charges, and the lookey loos hold their thin blue line and keep anyone from interfering with the police murdering a man in the street.
