There is a segment of the population that is violent, psychopathic, habitual, and frankly unrepentant.
I'm about as liberal as they get. But there is a segment of the population that frankly needs to be incarcerated.
We should be working on comprehensive prison reform. This most certainly should include review of how to release many non-violent offenders/non habitual criminals, minor drug infractions etc.
It doesn't have to be an either/or situation. But eliminating or abolishing prisons is not a realistic or intellectually honest debate one can have.
Abolishing prisons means not only removing a place that protects society from many violent and deranged people, but would also get rid of of a primary disincentive to commit a crime in the first place.
I always felt that low level nonviolent offenders should be given the option of working off their sentence performing menial jobs that many non- criminals donâ€™t want to do. They could add value to society rather than being a drain on the system with the cost of incarceration.
