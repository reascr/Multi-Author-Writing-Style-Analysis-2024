Now, personally I think this is all bullshit. Prior to the last couple elections this idea of such widespread conspiracy and corruption swaying the vote is a novel concept and unprecedented. We’ve gone almost 250 years, election results used to be handwritten and delivered on horseback but now all of a sudden in the age of cameras and fingerprint scanners someone found a way to cheat the election.
They believe elections have the potential to be corrupted. So they will argue we should have as few opportunities as possible to screw with the election, that we should restrict voting to only the most secure of methods.
I think they have actually really screwed themselves over a couple times by making it such a point of contention to distrust any ease of access to voting.
As others have pointed out, it’s specifically to tilt elections on republican’s favor, since more people voting means they do worse.
It's a way to limit the ability of poor people to vote, with the presumption that rich people are republicans while poor people are more likely to be democrats.
But a broader point here is that so-called “voter id laws” always include other provisions like this to suppress ways democrats tend to vote. The objection to these laws isn’t merely the use of an ID, it’s mostly the other ways these laws are designed to hurt voters.
