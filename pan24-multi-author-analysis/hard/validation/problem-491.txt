They're dirt cheap to mass produce and deploy. Yet they cost a fortune to find and "safely" recover. I say "safely" as even the real pros will still get injured or killed in cleaning up minefields. It takes a long, long time to find and recover mines compared to the ease in which they are mass manufactured and deployed.
I've also read that in some countries some of the civilians recover mines for the valuable scrap. Yet again, it's more often children who are affected the most when doing so.
On top of that, a lot of Russian people actually believe all the Kremlin propaganda. That's a double edged sword. On the one hand it helps Putin retain power and explain what's happening. But on the other hand, it prevents Putin, or anyone else, from withdrawing from the war.
The US doesn't want full scale attack on Russia proper. To stretch that out to them not wanting Ukraine to take Azov or Crimea , when the US has stated full support for the liberation of those areas, is certainly a hot take.
Yet since Russia invaded Ukraine, weakening Russia is a strategic imperative for the West -- to protect itself against an attack.".
With you on that. It would be better for everyone, including Russians, to be ruled under smaller and democratic states. Wouldn't solve all of earth's problems but it's a good start.
