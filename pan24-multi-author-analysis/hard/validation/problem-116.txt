If they ban social media the kids won't get pregnant anymore. Since social media is how the libs groom girls into seducing their church leadership. /s.
Hm. Well, your first paragraph is the only one that infers the contents of the First Amendment. On it, I'd say yes and no. Thinking about it, I'd imagine the ulterior motive is to prevent teens from accessing liberal viewpoints or safe spaces, but I do feel like there's some implication towards the toxicity social media brings to social status and body issues, with the repeated citation of rising mental health problems in minors.
And yes, they would definitely argue that vpns are bad because it gives kids access to social media, while also saying that vpns are bad because they are suppressing conservative opinions by blocking social media sites without the first hint of awareness of how stupid that sounds.
No they would find out that corporate vpns block things like YouTube, and then all of a sudden it would be a war on vpns.
Do they think that everyone under 18 is just completely oblivious to VPNs? So would id verification have to be for everyone, even outside the state or even outside the US? It seems like it may also end up steering teenagers to deeper more obscure and uncontrolled sections of the web.
Also isnt social media quite literally designed to be addictive, the damage is already done mentally to lots of teens who i doubt would just give up their access without trying things like a VPN. I agree with the idea i guess, but it seems like its about 10-15 years too late, as well as hard to implement affectively.
