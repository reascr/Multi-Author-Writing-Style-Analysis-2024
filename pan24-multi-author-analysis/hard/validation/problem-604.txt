"I've met with scientists, some of the top people in the world, that tell me that we have extraterrestrial craft in our airspace on a regular basis,‚Äù Burchett added.".
Yeah. So not outdated view. Its still overwhelmingly likely to be optical illusion, natural phenomenon and/or sensor errors.
Some certainly are. But these reports are apparently in areas that would not be likely test areas for experimental aircraft. Out in the ocean for instance. Not a good place to test a prototype if something goes wrong.
Skimmed it. That article presupposes as its axiom that these phenomenon are in fact physical crafts and thus calculate the forces and accelerations necessary to explain the observed path of these "objects". Its a flawed assumption.
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. New physics is an extraordinary claim. We have nothing approaching extraordinary evidence to support such a claim.
That's powerful evidence that these craft are not extraterrestrial. We must acknowledge that, given the local laws of physics, anything that is possible is possible independent of who's creating it (provided they have the requisite knowledge to make it), that we have no evidence of technologically superior civilizations that would have the knowledge where we don't, and that these craft are appearing here, where the only civilization we have any evidence of is us.
If the laws of physics allow one civilization to gain that knowledge and manufacture X, and the laws are invariant across the universe, then the laws of physics do not prevent any particular civilization from manufacturing X.
That means that either it does violate the laws of physics (and thus would wouldn't exist), or it doesn't (and thus any civilization with the requisite science could create it).
