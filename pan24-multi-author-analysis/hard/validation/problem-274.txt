It’s why it’s good this is finally getting actual medical acceptance so it can be studied and applied properly.
MDMA has been shown to be very effective in treating PTSD, but causes extreme negative side effects in depressives / bi polar. Shrooms is extremely effective for depression anxiety and addiction but very bad for schizophrenics, etc.
It’s extremely effective for treating anxiety, depression, PTSD, and addiction, but definitely not schizophrenia. It’s actively dangerous for them. Can cause acute psychosis.
Schizophrenia is the one condition which should absolutely never touch psychedelics. It can precipitate psychosis.
Friendly reminder magic mushroom spores are 100% legal to buy online, have sent through the mail, and possess in 25 45 US states and I think all of Europe.
>Mushroom spore kits are legal and are sold openly in stores or on the internet as the spores and kits themselves are legal as they do not contain psilocybin/psilocin. Psilocybin and psilocin are illegal to possess, obtain or produce without an exemption or license as they are schedule III under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.[21] Online dispensaries exist that illegally sell microdoses.[22] In September 2019, a motion to increase enforcement efforts against the sale of magic mushrooms was voted down by Vancouver council.[23] Efforts are underway to obtain exemptions for medical and research use under CDSA Section 56. In 2020, eleven end-of-life patients, including possibly also a first non-palliative patient, received exemption to pursue psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to help ease anxiety and depression.[24][25][26][27] In 2020, 16 health professionals received permission from the Ministry of Health to use psilocybin themselves to help develop therapies for future use.[28] In 2021, exemptions have been granted to use psilocybin therapy as a treatment for mental health conditions.[29] Canada health regulators announced that the government would allow physicians to request access to psychedelics on behalf of patients with serious or life-threatening medical conditions.[30] On October 5, 2022, the Province of Alberta announced it would effectively make all psychedelics, including Psilocybin mushrooms, legal and regulated for medicinal use from January 2023.
