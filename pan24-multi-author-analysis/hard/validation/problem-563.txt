We should also count ammunition from Belarus, from which Russia has taken more than 20,000 tons of ammunition. We donâ€™t know how large stocks are in Belarus, but by transferring its armored equipment and ammunition to Russia, Belarus remains a major resource.
Russia is running out of ammunition was a logistic issue due to overextension and lack of preparation in push model of Russian army. News reporters run with the first part without understanding.
I can imagine Russia severely depleting their missile and drones, but it would be insane to run out of shells.
Unless the munitions factories themselves are hit, waiting for Russia to run out of ammo is foolish.
I don't think Russia can easily run out of ammo either, but it can run out of soldiers if the war continues for a long time. What's the latest count on Russian casualties? Well over 100K? Who in their right mind would voluntarily want to fight for Russia?
I've seen videos of conscripts trying to run away - it's hilarious and sad at the same time. Can you imagine being forced to have to fight and die for your country, a country that is not worth fighting for. I mean, Russia could be a great country, but its governance for centuries has been abysmal.
