The boring answer is that it probably truly is a meteorological balloon with instrumentation that veered off course.
And the big reason to assume it wasn't really there for any nefarious purpose, regardless of what anyone in the media might be saying, is that balloons are extremely difficult to control the direction of. They're blown around by wind. That's why they use them to study weather. And look at pretty views. And pretty much nothing else.
The US is saying it's a spy balloon because, without 100% certainty about what it's actually doing, like all of the data is being 100% captured and interpreted by us, it's better to treat it as a threat than to not. So, say we think it's a spy balloon and then shoot it down, but there's literally nothing it can do as a military asset that some other vehicle couldn't do better.
Imagine being this hysteric over a harmless weather balloon and spending millions to shoot down a weather balloon with a missile. The US invades countries and kills civilians all over the world, but when another country has the audacity to accidentally let a weather balloon float over it acts utterly violated.
Quite the contrary, the United States understands very well that it's intentional, and the notion that it was a weather balloon gone astray isn't even slightly credible.
That's what weather balloons are - and that's what this was, regardless of whatever purpose it was being put to. A weather balloon.
The claim that it's a weather balloon gone astray was never even credible. It was capable of complex navigation, and seemed to have no trouble positioning itself over key surveillance locations in the U.S. and holding its position there. That it could do that, but somehow couldn't avoid straying from China to the United States is a laughable proposition.
