It is the unquestionable right of every American to vote his or her conscience unless it conflicts with my right to demand a Republican majority be appointed to power!
Either you would have to deny all felons the right to vote and hold office, or restore the right to hold office when you also restore the right to vote.
In New Mexico once you have completed your prison sentence (including any subsequent probationary period) you get your voting rights restored I believe.
The judge who ruled on this candidates' eligibility said that he believed the State Constitution does not allow to impose a DIFFERENT penalty for felons in terms of being eligible to run for office than being able to vote.
It would allow lawmakers to enact new laws as felonies that target their opponents and whittle down their opposition's ability to participate in the democratic process.
Also, as much as many may dislike the idea, it can be a threat to democracy to to disenfranchise folks permanently in such a wide covering manner.
Because rejecting the rules of democracy itself, like not accepting a lost election and threatening violence against your political opponents is a straight way into fascism.
At first it was just a few "tea party" weirdos, but since Trump and the storm on the Capitol there seems to be a lot of fascist tendencies in the republican party.
