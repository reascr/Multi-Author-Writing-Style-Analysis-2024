The historical test is bullshit. If that's the defining test for Constitutionality, then Thomas should have his marriage voided and shouldn't be allowed any sort of power, especially on a court. Women too. Domestic violence would mostly become (legally) a thing of the past. Historically courts were concerned with keeping the nuclear family together, not protecting victims. And I guess that means we can get rid of labor law regarding children too. Oh and safety regulations. You know, maybe this historical precedent thing has got something to it. It could certainly be used against Republicans.
It's really not though. There are other documents from the time that tell us what their thinking was on this matter. They viewed a national standing army as dangerous, but they recognized the need for the fledgling nation to protect itself. I mean, it's literally in the first half. "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State".
How can it both pertain to an unorganized militia and a well operating one? Also, in 2A the militia somehow belongs to the state.
Where does it say owning a gun is tied to being in the militia? IMO it states that a militia is necessary to secure our free state, and because of that, people have the right to own guns.
If militia is necessary: people have the right to own guns. That doesn't imply what you said, that being in the militia give you the right to own a gun.
Is that purely a statement that describes the intent of a militia? Civilians have the right to own guns to be able to own guns to serve in a well-regulated militia? Or, Americans have the right to own guns when serving in a militia? It all comes down to interpretation.
