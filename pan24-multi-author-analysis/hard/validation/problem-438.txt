2. Within a year, she began to suffer what sounded like severe domestic violence from her Sri Lankan boyfriend and the allowance from her family stopped coming. Since she can't pay for tuition, she got expelled and lost her visa status by June 2018.

>Wishma stated that she wanted to return to Sri Lanka, but she was put on a waiting list as she could not afford a flight home as commercial flights were unavailable due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

You mean she would have been better off than being starved to death by a Japanese state run detention center?
I was just pointing out how redundant it is for you to say 'it would have been better to do the thing that didn't get her killed'.
I mean she probably wasn't expecting to be murdered by the Japanese government for overstaying her visa. But that's what happened.
Damn near happened to me in the US. Damn cop got his fingerprints all over the evidence. I had to do the cops' investigative work for them, hire a detective and public defender out of pocket (a friend who liked playing cat and mouse with the cops gave me a specific recommendation). Spent 8 months proving my innocence. The attorney almost didn't want to take my case because I was innocent, but he gave me a 50% discount. The victim, a local government official, told me I should sue the county, but I was emotionally tapped out.
