But addiction can be avoided a lot easier than cancer. You can’t get addicted if you never use or ingest the substance in the first place. There are tons of people with strong genetic tendencies who never become addicted because they never use for the first time.
Yet apart from the supply-side “keep the pills off the streets” (which is clearly unsuccessful), no one seems to be talking about this at all. WHY are so many Americans picking up pills and heroin to begin with?? And how do we stop that from happening?
How do we prevent it? Treating cancer is important, but everyone agrees avoiding it in the first place is much better. But everything regarding these overdoses is about treatment and almost nothing about preventing addiction.
Unexpected potency is one of the primary sources of overdose, and it almost never happens to those taking opioids by prescription.
Fentanyl is eclipsing heroin and prescription pain pills as the go-to opioid. The epidemic has hit the young with alarming speed and disproportionately killed Black people and Native Americans in recent years. In 2020, overdose death rates increased 44 percent for Black people and 38 percent for Native Americans.
