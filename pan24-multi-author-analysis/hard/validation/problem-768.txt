I've been seeing more and more imperial Japanese flags being flown in recent years. Think that shame is trying to break through. Also seems wild to me that nobody really cares (except certain Asian countries) when they see that flag. Isn't that akin to flying a Nazi flag?
And yes Rising sun flag is a military flag, but do you know what other flag other than the Nazi party flag is banned in Germany? ( both 1935–1938 and 1938–1945 war ensign are banned unless in educational, artistic or scientific contexts).
While like you said its not a Imperical Japanese flag, however in Japan it was the IJA and in Germany it was a Nazi that drove the nations to war and to commit horrible atrocities.
Like imagine if Germany denies their atrocities, uses the swatsitka (Japan still uses the rising sun flag) and are actively racist towards the Jews. People would be furious, but Japan gets a free pass.
Japan's historical education is pitiful. People think their historical negationism only applies to the shit they did near ww2. But they revise things way back to Goguryeo era.
