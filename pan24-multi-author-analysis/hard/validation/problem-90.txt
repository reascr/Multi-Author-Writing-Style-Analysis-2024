Female gymnasts can have their periods delayed by years. No joke, depending on how active and intense they train, female gymnasts can have puberty delayed by two years or more. Which depending on circumstances could have a girl at 15 years old, competing in high school gymnastics who has never had a period. "Well, she's never had a single one, so obviously a man. Let's run a series of panels on her and then be baffled by the results.".
Um. How is that any of their business? Fine, you wanna know? I'll wear nothing to the games, and you can watch me bleed all over the place as a play. If they REALLY need to know that info so badly..
Who's "you all"? Trump lost the popular vote, TWICE. The majority of this country didn't vote for him. I, for one, didn't.
Trump became president because of the electoral college. Not because the majority of us voted or wanted him.
Those are both gross, and I hope to hell that's not the reason. Girls have been playing sports with their periods for a long ass time without the schools needing to know that shit. It's a child/teenager medical privacy. And no one beside her parents to and doctors need to know about it.
There are no medical reasons that schools need this information. Clearly it’s so they could suss out transgender people and punish them under the guise of “medically necessary“ information. The panel that recommended this needs to be disbanded and investigated which we all know won’t happen.
This isn’t 1950 where girls had to miss gym or other activities because they had their periods. This is nothing more than a witch hunt.
