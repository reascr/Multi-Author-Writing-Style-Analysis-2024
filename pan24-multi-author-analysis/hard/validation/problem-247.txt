Murkowski is a far better choice for Senate than the MAGA she was running against, but I voted for Chesbro, the Democrat with a background in education, as my first choice. When Chesbro was eliminated, my vote (like most who voted for her) was moved into Murkowskiâ€™s tally, giving Murkowski the win in the second round count.
Murkowski was down like .4% before ranked choice kicked in and then to the surprise of no one basically all chesbro (the Dem who was like 25% below both Murkowski and Tshibaka) voters had basically listed Murkowski 2nd and so she easily wins.
Tshibaka gets all the religious and MAGA voters. Murkowski gets the moderate republicans, moderate Dems, the Alaska natives and does weirdly well in the only progressive part of the state in the SE (probably because it's her hometown).
There aren't enough Dems in the state for a Democrat to win without winning the Alaska Native vote (see Peltola and Begich the last two Dems to win state wide). Murkowski as a write-in in 2010 pulled 80-90% in areas like Bethel and Barrow (now Utqiagvik). There's just no path for a Dem to win when Murkowski is on the ballot so no serious Dem even tries to compete vs her and they go after Sullivan instead who lacks Alaska Native support.
