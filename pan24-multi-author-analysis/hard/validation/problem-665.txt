What kind of “stinking thinking” is this??? How did this asshole get elected?? I feel for Alaska. Having this as a public official. Republican, of course.
It’s gotten to the point for me that I just have no clue what the fuck the Republican Party is, certainly not policy wise. The only things I observe as constants for them is hate and ignorance, with their words and actions a smoke screen so they can act like the shit bags they are.
I wish it weren’t so. It’s healthy to have debates by two or more honest parties, and I’d love to have a government made of people and parties that vehemently argued about how to assist society to be happy, healthy, and whole. Alas, cheating and what not is a trait of organisms, and unfortunately for us, institutions of power are natural paths of least resistant for those who lie, cheat, and steal. What’s also unfortunate is the opposite type of person doesn’t have time to police such a large institution, and apparently the safeguards are never adequate. Thus history repeats. Anyways, I’ve found myself rambling again!
