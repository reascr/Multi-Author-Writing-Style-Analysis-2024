I figured it was before he was out. Obviously it doesn’t have any bearing on his orientation. I just thought it was funny because he’s lied about so many things and then it comes out he used to be married to a woman.
ETA: given that this guy lies about everything, I suppose I should say I've seen pictures of George and the guy that's purported to be his husband. Who the hell knows if they're actually legally married.
I barely care about this guy but I've seen a bunch of pictures of him with his husband so that's not at all true. He's about 5 in shorter than George and Latino in case you don't believe me.
I've read a few anecdotes about people stopping by his office yesterday trying to find him and it was closed up. If he does have a staff they were making a serious effort to stay out of sight. He had a freaking shame moat around him and no one would get within 3 ft of him if they could help it. He looked miserable, which I really enjoyed.
His mother was a caregiver for elderly people and he stole checks from her clients and fraudulently cashed them. That's why he had to leave the country quickly. And he was married to a woman in Brazil, lol.
