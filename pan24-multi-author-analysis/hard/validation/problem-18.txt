They want Ukraine to shoot civilians after they get shot at by Russians dressed like civilians. Then they want to say “look at these monsters!”.
If their intent of wearing civilian clothes is to direct artillery or missile strikes or they have weapons and commit direct attacks while out of uniform, it’s a war crime.
The reason why I mention the execution part was hearing stories in WWII where soldiers would get caught wearing civilian clothing and pretty much shot on the spot. I'm sure it's much different now though.
Very much so, I'm sure some countries don't give a shit about the Geneva or Hugue though. I mean heck, look what they do to collaborators in Ukraine. They're pretty much hunted down and executed or car bombed. So in a way, I wouldn't be surprised if Russian soldiers were executed for wearing civilian clothing.
Chances are these guys are going to have guns and be shooting at advancing Ukrainian soldiers, so it's kind of moot.
They are saying Ukraine is sending small groups of soldiers or special forces in Kherson right now to check things out. Will see by tomorrow how it goes.
