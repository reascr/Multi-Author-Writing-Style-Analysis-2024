Can we admit that young people are arriving increasingly late to an already rigged and corrupt game of Monopoly, meaning this great nation eats its young and those at the bottom of the "food chain" for the profits of an extremely and increasingly abusive ruling class?
Can we admit that the corruption in our institutions and our economic and political systems create abusive and unlivable conditions for so many people, which get diagnosed and written off as individual "mental health" problems?
As we are collectively driving our young to suicide in disturbing numbers, maybe that should be a cause for reflection, maybe a sign that some things have gone fundamentally wrong and should be examined.
There are too many people with a vested interest in the problem - creating the problem, ignoring the problem, misdiagnosing the problem, "treating" the problem. It's like we're all engaged in a collective gaslighting about our actual problems and shared reality.
It reminds of that line from Chernobyl, "When the truth offends, we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it is even there, but it is still there. Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid.".
That's not quite what I meant. While easy access to guns increases mass shootings, it also increases suicide rates. Not only are suicide attempts more likely to result in death, there are also more attempts made as gun access gets easier.
