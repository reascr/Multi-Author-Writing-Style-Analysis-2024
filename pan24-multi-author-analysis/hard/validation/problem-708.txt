I thought about that when I typed it and was thinking "I wonder if flee is spelled differently than flee." It certainly felt wrong when I typed it. But somehow appropriate for this guy so I left it.
Depends on what losing means. For Ukraine to get its post war borders back + Crimmea might mean Putin gets ousted. But even then I don't think this guy gets extradited to Europe unless Russia's new administration is super friendly with NATO which I don't see happening. I just see relations warming slightly and the war ending. Not that they'll suddenly ship this guy or Snowden or anybody like that to NATO.
I don’t think Russia is going to nuke Ukraine, but they can. The threat of war with NATO holds them back, but having as many nukes as they do means they can do stupid crap with them and still have many left to use.
The reason the Russians failed miserably is because there was no longer an interest for conventional warfare after the coming of nukes. It was considered a waste of time and open for pillaging the army, because they had nukes.
Then the bluff doesn’t come from whether their arsenal works, it comes from the MAD doctrine and the unwillingness to start nuclear holocaust. Which is my point.
I think that's the point. If they are fucked by losing this war, why not take the rest of us with them? I mean, people say that would be stupid since russians would die too, but what makes people think they care about russians?
