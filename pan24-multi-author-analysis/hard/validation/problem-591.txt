Why be mad about it ? Taking money out of crooks pockets to fund Ukraineâ€™s reconstruction sounds good to me. (It would be especially ironic and savory if the crook in question turns out to be a Russian oligarch).
No thanks, no need to just act like Z is the only person in Ukraine deserving thanks and create new oligarchs to worship.
I guess if there are enough rich people who want to support Ukraine in a way that is still elite and exclusive, you could pull it off. Might work!
Hmm. Let's say 15% of the build cost as total annual operating expenses, so $15m. At 15 passengers, and let's say operating at an average 50% capacity... and assuming you'd like some actual net earnings to fund Ukraine's recovery... call it a ticket price of $7k per person per day?
That would net you $5m per year. Doesn't seem like much... but I guess if you service the ship exclusively at Ukraine's Black Sea ports and staff it exclusively with Ukrainians, then a lot of your annual costs are actually going to be plowed back into Ukraine's economy. So you could count that as an extra win.
