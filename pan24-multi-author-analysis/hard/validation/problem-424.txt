Then un-automate the process. If this requires charging people to upload video then so be it. Youtube isn't the preferred video platform anymore because most people who post videos get hit with DMCA trolling like this.
But I guess "I don't like how Youtube handles targeted campaigns" doesn't quite rally the troops like "Youtube censors voices against China".
But no matter how many times this exact same thing happens, people continue to be absolute dummies and pretend it's because X website is censoring the topic.
99.9999999999999999999999999998% of the time these warnings or suspensions are not because a company has an issue with the specifics of the content. It's usually automatic flagging responding to something it picked up itself, copyright, or targeted campaigns.
I can't even tell if you're doing it on purpose or not anymore. My entire point is just that this is not the result of Youtube having a problem with anti-chinese content.
The irony is Youtube is banned in China, so they're not even supposed to be on the platform. It means they're circumventing Chinese firewall controls.
