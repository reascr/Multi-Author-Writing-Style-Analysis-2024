The bureaucracy made it so that not even those at the very top had absolute power. Every leader after Stalin had subtle checks on their power. Khrushchev was tossed out for his apparent weakness in the Cuban Missile Crisis and his controversial De-Stalinization shit.
You can say a lot of things about the Soviet Union, but it really wasn’t a kleptocracy like Russia is today. Stalin didn’t institute 5 year plans just to kill all those people and enrich himself and all his pals. He had a genuine interest in building Soviet industrial power, obviously at the expense of millions of lives.
You're not being too outlandish though, obviously the soviets contributed a huge amount to the war. I think people got so sick of people on reddit claiming that the USSR did 99% of the work during the war that they're pushing too far in the opposite direction again.
Just my point is that it's the media trying to paint Russia red while its being a warmongering shithole, associating it with Communism again.
Also Putin is a perfect example of the remnant of Soviet propaganda still causing issues today. Putin is 70 years old and was already a kgb foreign intelligence officer stationed east Germany, so Theres no surprise that when it collapsed kgb got to power which paved his road to where he is today.
You're miss remembering, the quote is far worse. He said in a speech that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.
