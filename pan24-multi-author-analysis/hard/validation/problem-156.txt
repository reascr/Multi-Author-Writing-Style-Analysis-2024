I’ve had this conversation with my dad. I don’t think, on the whole, people are getting dumber. It’s just that the internet (and social media) have allowed dumb people with stupid ideas to find each other and be collectively loud now that they have a platform.
its a lot easier for the morons to find each other on social media and its allowed them to amplify their voices attracting more morons to their stupidity.
I think they're just saying that social media makes propaganda easier to distribute than ever, which is true. With all the data they take, they know which ones to target. Algorithms push people not paying attention to the far right.
I bet we all know at least one person who used to be "normal" who is now on social media regurgitating far-right talking points. I've heard some shocking things out of the blue from computer illiterate, mostly older people who get all their news on social media. Like, things Nazis would say. They were always conservative, they were always morons. Social media supercharges hate and it's way worse when there's zero moderation on the platform.
