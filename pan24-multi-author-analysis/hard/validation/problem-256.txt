No, it's quite the opposite. Since I have a gun and therefore can use overwhelming force to protect myself, I'm calmer and less fearful, meaning I'm less likely to scream and yell at people. And because I also know other people have guns, I'm also less likely to escalate the situation to the point where I may die.
I don’t know why you’d just assume they don’t know this, but okay, I’m a gun owner and advocate, and I am more than aware of these things.
If you actually tried to pay the least bit of attention and debate honestly, you’d realize they aren’t talking about gun control whatsoever in the comment you responded to - they’re talking about voting for conservatives in general, and they are completely right about the bigotry and intolerance.
To everyone who thinks that gun owners are fools for being single-issue voters, just remember that the Democrats also think gun control is more important than every other issue or they would drop it so we can progress on those other more important issues.
Either way, gun rights absolutists loooooove to cling to outlier cases like these while ignoring the fact that more shootings have been stopped by unarmed citizens than armed, and virtually none of those stopped by unarmed citizens appear on the top deadliest lists.
Look - I value my right to self-defense by firearm, but suggesting gun control doesn’t work is simply ignoring the absolute magnitudes of data that indicate the exact opposite.
But what I cannot do, is ignore all the data and pretend it’s as embarrassingly simplistic as only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.
But statistically speaking, you are more likely to die by your own gun than to stop a violent criminal with it.
Why do you think other countries with strict gun control have substantially fewer mass killings? Clearly criminals aren’t just turning to knives, cars, planes, and explosives at anywhere near the same rate - at least not successfully so.
