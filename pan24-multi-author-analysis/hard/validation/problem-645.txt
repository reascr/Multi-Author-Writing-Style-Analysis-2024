If no one holds them accountable, it's effectively legal. Too many of our laws have no real teeth, except for the ones involving loss of life or property crimes. The punishements for stealing property are are far greater than those of stealing elections or swindling average people of millions of dollars. I know which one affecrs society more. Yet the serious crimes related to safe and legal elections are not punished.
So are they notified that if they vote, they will be committing a felony? Because at that point, the only recourse is to let them vote after election day. This is an absolute constitutional disaster. You obviously can't let Ricochet Rabbit here and a handful of anarchists just say, "no black people can vote unless under threat of imprisonment". Kemp should be impeached and the anarchists imprisoned for election fraud.
It's too late. You are missing what this is. These people were notified that their right to vote was being challenged by the state and that voting MAY cause them to be imprisoned with felony voter fraud.
Don’t forget the courts saying, “Well, yes, that is illegal voter suppression but it’s too late to do anything about it this election. Better luck next time.”.
