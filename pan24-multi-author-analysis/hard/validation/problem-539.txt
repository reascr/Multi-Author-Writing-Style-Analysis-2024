The margin is so small that I think they'll have a failed impeachment article. Any republican in swing districts won't want to collar themselves with a ridiculous impeachment effort. But McCarthy will almost certainly have to promise to bring impeachment to the floor to placate the nutjobs in his party to get their votes for speaker.
That’s what I mean, even if the impeachment vote passes in the house, the next step in the process is the senate, which wont have the required votes.
Even if they pass impeachment, it'll go to the senate, won't reach 2/3 majority required to impeach and by the rules we're playing by now, that means that Biden is innocent because Trump apparently is and that will be the end of that?
It’s political circus, the GOP will try to impeach Biden 2 (or more times) so it takes the mantle of most impeached President away from Trump/the R side, and instead they can call Biden the most impeached President ever. And since much of their base doesn’t understand impeachment it will be a “win” for them.
It’s still insane to me that they want to impeach him over something his son did while he wasn’t in office. Again if we’re playing by the same rules, that would mean we could again impeach Trump over the whole Russian “adoption” scandal his son got involved in while he was President-elect, that his son openly admitted too.
