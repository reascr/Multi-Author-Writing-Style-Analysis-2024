Yeah, Mr. Trump? We finally found the funds for your wall, but there's a small little fly in the ointment, sure it won't be an issue or anything, the location. It's in finland.
in Finland but not in the US. That was your statement. I was simply pointing out your rather flawed logic and intellectual weakness. Further, anyone who needs to project that racism is the only reason people would want a southern wall and not a northern one really has no place calling any other human a bonehead. I realize you don’t have a lot of tools to work with but perhaps try something different. I don’t believe thinking is your forte’.
Nice way to explain why a wall totally works and makes sense in Finland but apparently in the US the only possible explanation is right wing racism. What a fucking joke. You don’t even pretend at honesty any longer. Just straight up political propaganda. An unsecured southern border to the US is a dangerous, unregulated potential entry point for anyone who would come here for nefarious reasons. The reason there is no Canadian wall is that for the most part, it’s hasn’t been an issue. We simply do a better job and more importantly Canada does and they work with us. The Mexican government is utterly corrupt and in many ways are aligned with and bought by the cartels. We can’t trust that the people being allowed through are safe. But keep lying to yourself and everyone else and keep crying racism as an excuse to oppose anything you simply don’t like. But realize that most people in the mainstream aren’t buying it and think people who hold these views are a little unhinged.
I just don't understand people who have strong opinions without even basic information about a situation.
You don't have to have a take. Same goes for everyone else who is speaking in ignorance and even if they have a superficial understanding, this is a matter for the Finns to settle. It's not really our business.
And the fact of the matter is EU is taking a tremendous amount of refugees in -- much greater than the US!
Other western countries take in much larger numbers of asylum seekers. USA is not even in the top 10 for hosting refugees by raw number per country. On a per capita basis we receive ridiculously low numbers.
Often core party Americans select which candidate they support based on who members of the opposing party oppose. I can make the case for Clinton and Sanders. Clinton did extremely well in the primary in states with very small Democrat populations. The vocal anti-Clinton rhetoric gave her a strong majority among Democrats. The effect gave Trump a windfall in Democratic states.
