Military style weapons have been banned in Canada for decades. "Assault style" is a meaningless label.
Assault style? What does that even mean? How about using some sort of objective measure for starters (e.g., weapons with a capacity of Just because a rifle is black or has a pistol grip or looks scary to someone doesnâ€™t make it any more dangerous than a regular looking rifle with a wooden stock.
Is it true that pretty much any skilled gun enthusiast could take lower-velocity rifle rounds, and add extra bulk propellant to the cartridge to get the same result? Yes. It would be difficult to regulate, but no more so than any of the other stupid rules they've tried to enforce.
Trying to regulate something you dont understand is impossible to do well. Look at the US congress trying to grill tech CEO's and making such giant gaffs that their misunderstanding and ignorance is clear to everyone watching. When someone says we need to ban climate change, they sound ignorant and probably dont have anything meaningful to contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and its the same with guns. If you own guns, treat them with respect and care and always follow the rules, its pretty galling to listen to people mischaracterize them, mischaracterize you and the people you know and love and make broad, generalizing statements out of ignorance.
