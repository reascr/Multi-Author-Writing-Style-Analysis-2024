The thing that scares me is that I believe there are enough low information swing voters out there who don’t understand how fascist and authoritarian Ron DeSantis is (more than Trump even), but who would likely vote for him over Biden based on age alone.
While it is entirely possible that a younger more exciting candidate may have a better chance to win than incumbent Biden, there are far from any guarantees that that will be the case, and I’d actually wager that it’s less likely than not.
Soon will come the rerun against Trump, likely without significant primary challenges to Biden, but again with the same strong likelihood that Biden is the only Democratic figure of any prominence that can beat him — yet away we'll go again with folks lamenting that we're stuck with this incredibly effective and dignified president with a strong likelihood of winning instead of... someone who can't win and probably wouldn't get anywhere near as much done even if they did, I guess?
If Biden runs it likely won't be particularity competitive because incumbents don't lose presidential primaries but that's entirely different from canceling the thing.
It's because he isn't a majority if the party's first choice but he is _broadly acceptable_ to the most people. Those 60% of Democrats who want to see someone else as the nominee don't agree on _which_ someone else they want as the nominee and so Biden would end up as the guy again, if he runs.
In the last poll I seen 60 percent of democrats don't want biden to run again. 80 percent of young democrats don't want him to run. This is not how you excite your base to get out the vote.
