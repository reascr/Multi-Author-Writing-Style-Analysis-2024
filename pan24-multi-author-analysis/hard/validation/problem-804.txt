Maybe because he is a little more insecure than Agent Orange. For one of your tweets, there are 25 cult members praising how great Musk is. Same for Trump. There are like 200 Bots under every tweet.
The more leave the site, the worse for Musk, the better for everyone. Twitter might have been important but it was molding since a while now and it's not like it's irreplacable. There can be others, not corrupted by Trumps Cronies and Muckus.
Trump is a conservative troll in it for the LULZ, sort of like The Joker. He doesn't care about money and wants Liberals to suffer and cry. That is why he was voted into office in 2016, he was different and didn't care about money like the other politicians and wanted to drain the DC Swamp.
Elon is a conservative troll in it for the money. He bought out Twitter to reform it and build on it.
