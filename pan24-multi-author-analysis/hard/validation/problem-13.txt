Chinas population struggle will likely be even more severe than in Japan. But this is only a temporary problem, as genes favouring more children will slowly become more prominent.
Even longer perhaps, but those who have more children for whatever genetic reason will become more dominant. These social groups already exist, like Mormons in Utah or in Israel.
There can be a genetic component for example which attracts people to Mormonism. I don't see why outside of religious groups society would not move slowly in favour of those who have more children, and eventually whatever genes cause people to have more children will become more dominant. In fact evolutionarily it should be considered an eventuality, rather than an unlikely outcome. To assume it does not exist in the human genetic genepool already is likely to be false.
Yeah social groups, but you said genetic above. "Have more children" isn't really in the genetic wheelhouse of humans on any societal timeline (hell, I don't even think the needle has moved much on evolutionary timescales).
