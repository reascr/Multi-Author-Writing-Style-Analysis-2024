Drive to your nearest inner city and ask yourself why Biden chooses to send $37 billion to Ukraine instead of fix the city you’re driving through. Ask yourself how long has that city looked that way. Ask yourself what $37 billion could do for that city. It’s mind-boggling that none of you see how bad the Democrats manipulate you for a vote and do nothing for you.
Wild to think without gerrymandering, republicans would have lost the house…they cheated and even then they barely won. It’s sad to see everybody getting mad at dems for losing the house but in reality, republicans should never have control of it in the first place….
Man... Republicans barely did anything this midterm and what they did accomplish is so small plus it was overshadowed by Trump haunting the GOP.
But at the end of the day, the Republican majority will be so small that it’s going to be essentially irrelevant. The GOP can’t agree on anything, it’s just going to be 2 years of chaos and inactivity in the House.
Really makes you wonder what would have happened if we hadn’t used the 5 GOP state maps that were ruled unconstitutional for illegal gerrymandering.
