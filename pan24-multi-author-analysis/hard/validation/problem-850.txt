Fwiw, I feel like there needs to be at least a ten year’s cooling off period between these sorts of things. Otherwise it feels a lot like “keep putting it up for vote until we get the result we want” which is a pretty scummy way to get things passed.
How are they going to get forced to hold a vote if they don’t want to. And why would they ever want to if polling wasn’t showing the vote was safe.
No reason why more voting is a bad thing in a democracy, might have prevented a lot of issues. See:current UK government popularity.
Edit: I think 2 different votes involved farming, maybe 3 different votes were about VAT. Probably unfair to claim that they are entirely different.
There have been referendums that affected Switzerland’s EU agreements, with significant repercussions. A vote on immigration that runs contrary to EU agreements for example has the potential to tear up decades of EU-Swiss agreements and to significantly affect their economy.
In 2022, yes. But there is nothing preventing the same issue from being voted on 4 times in a single year, and there is precedent for the same issue to be tweaked and voted on repeatedly across subsequent years. The Swiss-EU relationship has often been the topic of multiple referenda in a single year for example, and there certainly isn’t some arbitrary decade long time between votes.
