But there is a basic logical problem with this definition. Woman means "an adult who lives and identifies as female" but a female is "a woman or girl". So it's a circular definition.
From your point of view, I agree, those circular definitions probably don't seem like a big deal at all. You might know tranpeople in real life, and you treat them with the respect they deserve because you intuitively understand their stance on gender.
Trans women are women; the fact some people don't like that and may choose to believe otherwise is immaterial.
Trans women are just that… men who believe they are women. It doesn’t matter how long or often you say it, you can’t change reality. Transwomen ≠ women, they are quite literally men down to the cellular level.
Also, by the logic you're following, cis women aren't women either. They'd be cis women. At which point no one is a woman, since neither cis or trans women would qualify.
“Cis” is an invention to bring gender down to a “type.” So people like you can say the female gender comes in two varieties, cis and trans, but both have equal claim to womanhood. They don’t.
