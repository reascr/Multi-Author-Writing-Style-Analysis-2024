On their 2015 federal return, Trump and his wife declared negative income of $31.7 million, with taxable income of $0. The couple paid federal income taxes of $641,931.
The 2018 return declared total income of $24.4 million, with taxable income of $22.9 million. The Trumps paid $999,466 in federal income taxes.
So if you sum up all those federal taxes, the Trumps paid -$3.69 Million dollars in taxes, which is to say- the government paid them $3.69 million.
Let's say Trump pays $3 m in estimated tax payments for one tax year. This is the total tax that his CPA's are either estimating, or having him pay in to avoid taxes/penalties based off whatever estimate they are working with. Trump declares, for whatever reason, $0 of taxable income (Perhaps he got wiped out on a real estate sale, etc).
The 2020 return shows negative income of $4.69 million, with zero dollars in taxable income. The tax paid by the Trumps was $0 and they claimed a refund of $5.47 million.
Quarterly payments would be included in a refund figure if he ended up with $0 in taxable income. I agree that $5 million in estimated payments is very high considering the prior year tax of $133k - definitely something else going on. Considering 2020 was the pandemic, there's likely some credits he took advantage of to get such a high refund.
