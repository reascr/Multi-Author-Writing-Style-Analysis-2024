Then by 80s suddenly there was a real panic of American being taken over by Japan economically. That is why media from the 80s (Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, Karate movies, sci-fi novels) all have significant Japanese supremacy etc.
I think the point is what we think of Japan is what we think of China now. Japan used to sell walmart quality crap, now high tech products. The same thing can also (and already partially) happen for China.
China's growth period has past. Population is falling and will halve by 2050. Seriously, half! A crash like that has no equal in history, we don't even have a model for what that does to an economy.
But for now... Russia isn't getting much oomph from China's processers, which is what we are all discussing here.
I guess Russia's plan of "we will just buy everything from China and India now" is failing. Especially since China also creates large problems for russian ship cargo certification, since they refuse to accreditate russian cargo and lowered the import of cars and electronics into Russia.
In the recent past, Russia has also restricted the export of some of their most advanced military technology to China, who has otherwise been their largest importer of military equipment.
