“Hey, look at all this cool art deposited between 1939 and 1945. We’ll give it back, but only if you have a hard copy of a receipt. They burned everything? Oh well.”.
Agreed. I guess Brazil still trips me up though because there’s no real reason for them not to take a stronger stance either. One Brazilian told me they couldn’t “risk trade being impacted with Russia”, but I don’t buy that given that 81% of Brazil’s trade is done with 25 nations, and Russia isn’t one of those. At best Russian goods constitute less than .8% of Brazil’s trade. And for countries that constantly deride colonialism and imperialism and the evils of it and how all of their problems are because of colonial invasions and imperialist meddling, it just strikes me that a literal imperialist nation invading a small, weaker one purely as a land grab is casted as “not our problem” or “a European issue”. Like how would any of these countries feel if they got invaded by the US or China and Europe/the US/the rest of the world said “that’s a Latin American problem”.
I’m not asking Brazil to go to war with Russia, or to even supply military aid. But at the very least, maybe your president shouldn’t be blaming Zelensky and refusing to so much as acknowledge that what Russia is doing is wrong. And sorry but I don’t think, even if they were your enemy, Russia is going to be crossing the earth to invade Brazil. But to answer your question, if they did, you can bet your ass the US would be fighting Russia and/or China if they tried invading a country in the western hemisphere. The US might not get involved with a border skirmish between your country and Venezuela, but if Russia tried to shit there I hope you know we’d be jumping at the excuse to kick their asses, regardless of your NATO status.
If you guys wanted to do some military exercises with your border, I think the united States is too busy with Russia to bother.
