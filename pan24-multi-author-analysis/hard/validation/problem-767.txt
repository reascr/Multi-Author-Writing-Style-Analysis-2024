I mean it's important to me in that this country has been taking away gun rights for years. I would like the federal government to step in to help in the state of Washinon, where they are considering a horrendously unconstitutional AWB.
Many countries suppressors are not regulated. The US needs to loosen gun laws as we have seen recent major shootings in some of the strictest states like California.
How would loosening gun laws lessen the amount of shootings? Please explain your logic. As for CA, many guns flow into the state from surrounding states with weaker gun laws. The solution is to strenhen gun control in those states... not loosen them in CA.
You want progress on gun control or any other issue? The democrats are squishy and the republicans are completely opposed. Seems like a simple choice.
The endless mass shootings, reproductive rights, voting rights, the failed sedition, bigotry, economic security werenâ€™t enough to get even a majority of votes for the house. At least other elections gerrymandering was an excuse.
Who cares about polls. It only matters what people vote for. Gun control has been a loser in elections for a long time.
I think most politicians, at least the ones who get elected pander for votes. I also think there are 2 years every decade where the democrats have the house, senate and presidency so that some modicum of progress can he made.
