Ehh it sort of is, you get delta 8 THC by converting it from CBD, essentially you add an acid, let the CBD turn into THC, then remove the acid, leaving you with a form of THC.
Yes, because delta variants are still forms of THC, if it behaves the same way (binding to your CB1 and CB2 receptors) it'll almost definitely show as THC on a test.
May be their fear is just the fact you can chemically transform CBD into THC these days, it's called delta 8 and HHC.
But how is it easy to smuggle THC in CBD product? Here CBD is legal THC is not, police got a little tester that says instantly if it contains THC or not.
We really don’t know how CBD is manufactured and it’s not subjected to FDA approval. Not to mention the aspects of the illegal marijuama industry being involved. These products may very well end up being laced with Fentanyl as regular weed is being laced with this too. CBD needs to be banne in the USA too as the drug culture is getting out of control everywhere. THC and CBD need to be regulated like every other potent drug.
