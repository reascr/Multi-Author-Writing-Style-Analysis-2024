Crimea is an important military staging area for Russia's invasion into Southern and South Eastern Ukraine.
Russian military infrastructure in Crimea are legitimate targets even if you're Elon Musk and thinks Crimea belongs to Russia.
I'm pretty sure that Russian civilians will be civilly allowed to leave through the Ukrainian roads, if they are stupid enough not to do so once it becomes apparent that Ukraine inches closer to Crimea.
If UKR does push into Crimea, I wonder how much "score-settling" is going to take place, or if the international community is going to give much of a shit about dead Russian civilians.
I am sure that Russia will offer to hold another referendum if the situation at the front becomes dangerous in order to find out the "opinion" of Crimeans, who will soon be less than half in Crimea and show the whole world that Crimeans love Russia.
To be honest, as a person who was born and grew up here, at first everyone was happy about joining Russia, but when the Russian reality entered the lives of Crimeans, many were very disappointed. No one had ever thought of joining Russia before, but Russian propaganda was very active in Crimea and everyone thought that the revolution of 2014 would lead to a large number of victims.
I will say one thing for sure - no matter how the news about the weakness of air defense in Russia is written, its concentration in the Crimea is so large that not a single drone will fly.
