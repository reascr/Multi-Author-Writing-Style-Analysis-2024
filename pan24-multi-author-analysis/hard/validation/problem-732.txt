We're talking single digit majority here, and a lot of these people's lives were unequivocally put in danger by Donald Trump, so this actually seems possible, but probably a pipe dream. I guess The GOP would have committees if they had the majority, but The Speaker could form her own as well?
You need a majority in the House, not only be the one getting the most votes. Pelosi could come in first place for dozens of roll calls, but wouldn't become speaker unless she got 218 votes, which would require Republicans voting for her.
If it's a majority of one or two, all bets are off. But anything beyond that and surely theyll manage to push through. Even of it requires a dozen roll calls.
They can stall. Which eventually would lead to bad press. But they won't defect to voting for Pelosi.
It would be the end of their career, not sure there's any moderates left who'd want to go out that way (especially because they aren't Pelosi moderates, they are right wingers who dislike MAGA, they don't have a problem with mainstream GoP positions).
The Dems could all unite behind a moderate Republican that they'd prefer over anyone the Republicans would vote for, and they'd only need a few GOP defectors to win a vote. I don't think it's a crazy idea at all.
I agree that I don’t think it will happen. It just makes it interesting to think about since it sure doesn’t seem like McCarthy will have the votes right now. I’d imagine Republicans will fall in line but Andy Biggs is rumored to be vying for Speaker too….
