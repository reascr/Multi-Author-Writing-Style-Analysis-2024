The Greeks settled their lands and displaced their people way back thousands of years, and the Macedonians with the Greeks destroyed the empire that ruled them in a stable and fair manner, just to lead to massive civil war that uprooted the region for decades.
But then people start talking about the past and our independence war (1919-1923) becomes “the Greek Genocide” when in reality Greeks came, tried to ethnically cleanse western anatolia from Turks, got wrecked and cried “genocider”. Until the Greek invasion there were no racial tensions to the point of ethnic cleansing.
In general, all throughout the Ottoman lands, Turks were literally killed, raped, and coerced into migrating to Anatolia when the empire started to fall. Millions of refugees came because Serbians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Armenians… all wanted their lands ethnically cleansed from Turks. Who knows how many didnt make it to Turkey. No one talks about it. But the ethnic cleansing of Greeks from Anatolia, which shamefully did happen but triggered by the Greek invasion, is oh so much more important.
Well thats wrong, the Greeks invaded to enforce the treaty after WW1 that granted eastern Anatolia to Greece. The Turks beat them and the British and French didn't help because they lost their own battles with the Turks. The Greeks then evacuated (depopulated) ethnic Greeks from Eastern Anatolia. Before that ethnic Greeks suffered greatly under the Ottomans. Neither side is completely guilty or innocent, but to claim that the Greeks were just slaughtering Turks left and right is just wrong.
