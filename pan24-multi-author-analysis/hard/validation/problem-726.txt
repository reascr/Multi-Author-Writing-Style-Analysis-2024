Yep, Umbrella Man in Minneapolis springs to mind, and Boogaloo Bois were instrumental in starting the fire at the third precinct. Not the only perpetrators but I often wonder if that building would have ever burned like that if there were no white supremacists trying to start a race war present.
And pro-police conservatives conveniently ignore the fact that pretty much all the 2020 protests that became violent were because the police attacked them. Of course there were the legit riots, civil rights movements and riots often run parallel, for what should be obvious reasons, but if you see a video of people with signs involved in an altercation with police I guarantee the police attacked the crowd first.
All I'm saying is that I find it a little sus that the incident that sparks the most immediate outrage AND preemptive action from the Police Department itself (and other Law Enforcement Organizations) is the one involving all black people. Where the fuck has this energy been?? All of a sudden on this case the champions of "We investigated ourselves and found no wrong doing" found the error of their ways?? I'm just tired of this shit man. Hopefully this indeed is a turning point for our country and laws concerning police officers. But I ran out of hope 20yrs ago.
