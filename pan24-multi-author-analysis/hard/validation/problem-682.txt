Stuff does have an effect at almost any dosage, certainly any dose you can feel, and it is addictive. As someone who drank socially for years and years I didn't really want this to be true, but it is.
He gave the excuse that he didn't want the drink to control him. So to not make the drink control him he was going to show he could drink it without being addicted. Yet that weird circle idea is clearly him trying to justify his reason to keep on drinking without acknowledging it's an addiction.
I'm dealing with a friend who's an alcoholic. He was just living with his abusive parents for so long and did all sort of drugs to cope and wasn't doing anything with his life. I took him in as a last resort for his life. He's still at the stage of denying that a drink here and there is bad, even though that drink or 2 is done alone in his room.
It's tough. But I hope I can get him through. I know I'm going to have to deal with a lot, probably will start hiding it now that I confronted him.
It really isn't. Tons of studies have been done on people that just have a few drinks a day. Still come up short in negative deficits compared to a control groups.
