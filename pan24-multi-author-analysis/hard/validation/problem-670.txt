I was under the understanding that he took shit when he was allowed to with his position. They politely asked for it back and he lied saying he gave it all back. Too dumb to realize there's records. And the cops are using the fisher price route to get our shit back.
I've seen multiple people reiterate this on every trump news this week..i know it doesn't make sense I'm essentially quoting some magidiots.

How the fuck can't a billionaire hide paperwork any better than a supply closet at a low rent golf club and a rent a shed? I mean i know the juiciest stuff has sailed the 7 seas already 1st class, but goddamn if my hero was that fucking dumb I'd jump ship.
I wish we could have a functional government enough to take every example trump made into coded rules instead of this understanding they've relied upon for hundreds of years.
So what youâ€™re saying is that every president until trump has followed the rules and that due to trumps obvious criminal activities the government will have to change their rules.
