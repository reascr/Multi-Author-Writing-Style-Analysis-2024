Russia breaks by May 2023. Russia is losing equipment, man-power, training, ammunition. Ukraine has 4x more equipment, man-power, training and ammunition as they did at the start of the war.
A squad of Russians finds a random Ukrainian guy, makes him put on a Russian uniform, and hands him a broken rifle.
It's not so they'll fight, it's so they can be bullet shields and cause Ukrainians to hesitate before firing.
Even if they don't find one, Ukrainian fighters liberating the region won't know who's a soldier and who's a captive with a broken gun.
It's a mind game. Not about these captives actually fighting, hand them a loaded gun and they'll likely to kill the Russians instead.
So; another form of genocidal tactics - send the young ones in to die, and if they surrender to their Ukrainian countryfolk, they get shot.
that's what I was meaning they would send these kids into the ukrainian lines to soak of gunfire and expose ukrainian positions or at least exhaust there ammo. It would be hard to tell that their not russians if these kids are forced into russian uniforms.
