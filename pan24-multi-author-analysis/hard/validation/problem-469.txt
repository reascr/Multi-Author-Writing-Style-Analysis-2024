Joe Biden himself could literally walk up to these people who claim he's senile and say the following:
That stated, there's presently no reason to seriously doubt Joe Biden will be able to serve another four year term.
I affirmatively do NOT want her as VP if Biden runs for reelection because I think sheâ€™s failed to demonstrate that she would make a decent president.
I mean, yeah, ideally he'd replace her as VP for his reelection, but people act like the nation would be completely rudderless if something happens to Biden. She's a bad candidate, but she's a pretty generic Democrat and would probably be a stable hand if that happened. The fear of Biden dying in office really isn't as big of an issue as people paint, unless the VP is truly abhorrent and unqualified (Palin, for example).
And Bernie is a socialist trying to infiltrate a center-left party, just like Bloomberg was a Rockefeller Republican trying to do the same.
I don't know what to tell you. You guys seem to be pissed when people keep voting GOP, but then don't want to accept them into your coalition at the same time. What do you want, exactly? For us to not vote Democrat?
