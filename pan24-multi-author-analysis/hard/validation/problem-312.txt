But potentially with much longer range -- the Iranian Shahed-136 has a range of 2000 km, for example.
On an offensive, if plenty of these drones are over the battlefield, that will make the enemy keep their heads down and not use their weapons.
I've seen those as they very slowly sneak up to their target, but imagin a fast moving drone coming as a surprise attack like a flying soldier - should be tested at least.
My guess is the return drones they send on multiple missions are probably better for probing attacks and front-line support (You expect it to break fairly rapidly anyway). The suicide drones are probably going to be more for back line disruption or Emergency support to a unit that needs it.
i think the difference is the grenade droppers are larger quad copters hovering in place while the suicide drones are more a model airplane coming in fast and boom. smaller faster targets.
all our shit was aimed at the USSR, now holdout russia... finally our mothballed shit can kick the rotten teeth out of that last holdout.
the truely grizly part is... how much did the west spend on defeating the USSR... now there is one holdout.. Russia.. if we collectively, hell even if the US alone just dumped 20Bil to destroy russia and prevent it from putting another orange agent in the oval office, thats a fucking bargain?
