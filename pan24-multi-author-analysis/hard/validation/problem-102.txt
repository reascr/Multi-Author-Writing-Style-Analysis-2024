Two Jewish guys from Odesa meet up. One asks the other: ‘So what’s the situation? What are people saying?'”.
Yep. Plus they repeated their own propaganda about Ukrainians so much that they started to believe in their superiority and underestimate Ukrainians. If someone is capable to stop Russian soldier than it can't be Ukrainian...
But all in all, russians are fighting the tenacity of Ukranian people, who're super inclined to defend their freedom to death, their own or their enemy's.
They believe that civilians of Ukraine are just Russians that are waiting for liberation and everyone that fighting them are brainwashed Russians that became nazis and NATO soldiers.
They keep saying they're fighting NATO in Ukraine because that's the only way they can excuse the amount of failure they've had. Russians would not be happy if they realized they entered a 1-year long meat grinder in exchange for barely holding the frontline in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia always lived off the "Don't wake the sleeping bear" propaganda of their army being hyper-macho commandos with giga-hypersonic missiles.
