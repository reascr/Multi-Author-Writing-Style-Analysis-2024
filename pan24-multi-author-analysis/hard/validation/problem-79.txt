They are still, at their core, organized crime. Fsb, oligarchs are all just various mafia members that report to putin. After ussr, they just rebranded, but the same mafia structure is there. This is super obvious when we look at Moscow vs other 'cities'.
Because it's not Russia. It is hackers based in Russia. As in the hackers might be Russian or located in Russia. But are most likely not state sponsored. So just a criminal hacking operation.
Atleast thats what the article suggests. I wouldnt know why Russia as a state would spend time attacking Australia from all places. But Putin works in mysterious ways lmfao.
True, hence why I keep the option open that the state might have something to do with it. The only thing that makes me think it's purely financial is the current mess the Russian state is in. I can't imagine them using the resources they have on anything other than Ukraine and their allies.
But hey, I am just going by things based on the surface. There might be something to gain from this beyond financial gains. I am sure the Russian state is well aware of the activities of this gang however.
