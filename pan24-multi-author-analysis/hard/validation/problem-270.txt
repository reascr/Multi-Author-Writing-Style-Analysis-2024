He has to run again. In his mind, it's the only thing keeping him from being indicted. I honestly don't know whether he could get the nomination over DeSantis, but my dream scenario is they both run, DeSantis gets the nomination, and Trump runs as an independent, splitting the conservative vote. He's easily narcissistic enough to knowingly sink Republican's chances of retaking the white house in order to be able to proclaim his immunity from prosecution for another 2 years because he's a political candidate. It's not even like DeSantis could promise him a pardon if he drops out, because 1, there's no way Trump can let himself believe DeSantis could succeed where Trump failed, and 2, it looks like some of the charges coming are at the State level, so a presidential pardon wouldn't reach that far.
If Trump runs, even if he ends up losing to Desantis, Trump will expose every dirty secret about Desantis, and make him look weak with insults that Desantis doesn't fight back, and claim he is a secret Democrat in a red suit. If Trump loses, he'll very likely trash Desantis and refuse to stump rallies in support, and will pull away MAGA voters that don't want any alternative and will sit out the election.
DeSantis is a bit more savvy than Trump, so I don't see him making that deal as it wouldn't benefit DeSantis in the long-run and would lose votes of those who oppose Trump.
