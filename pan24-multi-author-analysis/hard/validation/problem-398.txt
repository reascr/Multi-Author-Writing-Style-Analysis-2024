It is. New Year is like a presents and family gathering big day. Christmas on the other hand is purely religious holiday and there are zero presents-related traditions tied with it - there are a very few specific foods some families cook but that's pretty much it.
Most don't even consider that as a holiday - just a free day off work. In fact, Christmas is lower in "tier list" of holidays than Easter. Namely because Easter does have some traditions (painting eggs and going out with family to sort of picnic) which is why more non-religious people actually get involved in celebrations, while with Christmas - unless your family and/or your close circle is religious - no one cares much.
Relatives and some friends in Vinnytsia, colleagues and their families/surroundings in Lviv/Uzhgorod/Mukacheve (which is most western possible), some friends in Kyiv and my whole life in Kharkiv - that's where my experience coming from. St Nicholas day is indeed used for presents (more on west, but east too) but never heard of Christmas presents in Ukraine at all.
New Year's Eve is still the biggest celebration day in Ukraine, as far as I've heard. My family celebrates New Year's and both Christmases, and it's one of the best times of the year. It's a great reason to get together and eat, drink, and celebrate life. Might be different for families who don't like each other as much, though. xD.
Wot? You're making it sound like Christmas was made up only when Christianity moved into central Europe. Christmas was there from the get go, evolving out the Roman Saturnalia and Sol Invictus celebrations. Sol Invictus was literally on December 25th and briefly popular in Rome before Christianity was even legal.
