Except the lender in this case is the Federal government... I don't know if private student loans are different but that's not what this case is about since the Fed obviously can't discharge private loans through a private lender.
My guess is she didn't qualify for Federal loans and had the bright idea to get private loans and her education didn't pan out sadly.
If they discharged private loans then she and everybody else would be slightly impacted by a possible tax increase even if it's slight.
Yes, that's how this relief works. The Federal Government is the lender and can dictate and modify how much is owed. The money received from students paying the loans just kinda goes into the budget only to be sent out with new student loans.
If you think these are comparable, you must not have been accepted to any school worth taking loans out for .
in case you’re one of the “uneducated” there are a number of programs that forgive student loans. Also this doesn’t forgive the whole loan only up $10k.
It’s fine if you don’t agree with his view on student loan forgiveness. I certainly don’t. But let’s not start making PPP loans some kind of boogeyman. Lots and lots of small (even tiny) businesses got them. They were never loans, really - everyone knew it was free money.
