A law voted in 2020 is taking survivor benefits from the children of servicemembers killed in action. The families losing the benefits found out only a month ago that the December 2022 payment will be the last one.
They used to, but as of January 2023, only surviving spouses will get survivor benefits, even if the children have been receiving benefits for years. The only way children can get the benefit is if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse becomes ineligible (remarries before age 55).
I see how this is a difficult law to craft because there could be times where someone remarried and died 20 years later, in which case it may be the current wife and kids who need the benefits. I'm not defending the policy, or anything, just pointing out a possible legislative difficulty on this issue.
This is unfortunate. The reason is that the father who was a service member remarried right before his death, so his kids mother was no longer the surviving spouse.
It was military spouses who fought for this, because they didn't want some of their money going to the deceased veteran's children from a prior marriage. Hopefully it will be changed back, or some compromise can be reached.
