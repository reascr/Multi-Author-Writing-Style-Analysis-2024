Both are bad. Very bad. But attacking illegal immigration while utilizing and benefiting from it for profit imo is worse than having the family farm outside of California while representing California.
I think the family farm in Iowa, outside of California where those circumstances are so common as to be expected, is what makes it so bad because it gives the appearance that Nunes' imported undocumented workers from California to the Heartland in order to exploit them and dodge contributing to California tax coffers at the same time.
That instead of taking advantage of pre-existing, readily available undocumented labor in a state that has far more protections, services and support for undocumented workers, it could appear that Nunes, knowingly and with premeditation, went out of his way to procure and import undocumented labor in a state where the undocumented would certainly enjoy less community and state support, and aid in the event of worker abuse.
But this is a great reminder that, no matter how much conservatives complain about undocumented workers and are enthusiastic about making undocumented people in the USA suffer, conservatives are WHOLLY against any sort of punishments for employers who hire and facilitate a system of recruiting and employing undocumented workers.
