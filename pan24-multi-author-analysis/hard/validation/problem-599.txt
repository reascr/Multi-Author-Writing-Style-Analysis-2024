You do know that in order to detonate a thermonuclear hydrogen bomb and create the temperatures and pressures necessary for fusion you have to build it inside of a fission bomb with traditional radioactive material like plutonium or uranium right? Hydrogen bombs still have radiation, though I’ll be honest I don’t know the difference in radiation levels between a straight up fission bomb or a fusion bomb detonated by fission.
Modern hydrogen bombs don't irradiate, they just vaporize and create shock waves. If that were to happen, I'd rather be in the center than be a survivor.
Air allows the energy to spread quickly. The closer to the ground the more you are wasting energy in pushing all that excess matter, and all the nasty isotopes of uranium, cesium, thorium, iodine, etc.
Modern hydrogen bombs detonate a half a mile or so above ground level. It creates way less radioactive isotopes than the older cold war bombs. They are typically three stage, which uses fusion triggers to create fission, hence higher yield of energy given the amount of fuel source.
