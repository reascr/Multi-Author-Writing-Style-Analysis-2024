It's pretty much The Handmaid's Tale now, with the persecutions of trans parents and their kids. People are fleeing my state in droves, as well as Texas. All my teacher friends are thinking of leaving for New Mexico and elsewhere. It's too insane in the Sooner State.
They hate on teachers to run the teachers off. They know what they are doing is discouraging teachers from staying in the field. They want them to run away. It's all part of the Republican plan. Look up Christopher Rufo. He's the guy who came up with the Critical Race Theory panic. He admits that he is only doing this to set up his Christian nationalist camps, where he will force kids to be Christians or be expelled from society.
Teachers already are having to sacrifice their plan periods due to severe staff shortages, and now they are going to be giving up lunch.
One would think so, but in Arizona teachers often have to work during lunch to supervise students. My last year in the classroom, I had a schedule that required me to work up to 6 hours without a single break to go to the bathroom.
