You should have seen our other amendment on the ballot that would allow the state legislature to call itself into session whenever it wanted. It was the size of a fucking CVS receipt on our ballot. There is a disparity of hundreds of thousands of votes between it and this abortion amendment where people didn't even bother.
I definitely lean on Ballotpedia a lot (and honestly find it baffling and a red flag when candidates aren't themselves utilizing it). I also know I am not in the majority of people that don't stay informed throughout the whole process ahead of elections.
I used to look up the issues showing up on my ballot before going in for early voting (2022 elections -.
I feel like ballot measures should also put a moratorium on the issue being brought back up. I feel like they're gonna keep trying to ban abortion anyways despite the people clearly speaking.
I'm still convinced that the GOP has miscalculated: there is FAR less enthusiasm for abortion-bans, even among republicans, than they think there is.
The crazies might have demanded results, but my point is that they - or at least a much greater number of them than the GOP thinks - didn't and don't actually want this result. They just say they do, because that has become the thing you do to show how Christian you are. Only a lot of them don't actually mean it. They just want to fit in. "We are the tribe that hates abortion Grrrrr Here's me really hating abortion" But what they actually mean when they say this is "I want to be one of the tribe" They're not actually talking about abortion when they do this. They're talking about tribal affiliation.
