I particularly enjoy it, as a non-American, when republicans (both the politicians and voters) handwring and fearmonger about the American "extreme left".
"Sorry but we have no leeway in the budget this year for any studies on gun deaths, really we're barely breaking even. See? It's all right here in the minutes from the last board meeting in St Lucia.".
Here's the thing. Symbology is literally literature. I'm using symbology (which spell check says I'm spelling wrong ffs) to communicate with you, and you with me. Did I steal the word symbology? No, I'm communicating something. Same thing when I play you a melody. Like John Lennon said, paraphrasing... it comes from the universe and goes back into the universe, and I'm just a vessel. So are you. So is everyone.
Well, Christ feeding the masses is a pivotal part of the tale, fish and loaves. I never really look at anything as being "stealing from" in history, because everything is built on the past, every single thing about us. Fish was important to the ancient Greeks for sure, given their geography of course, but it was just as important to people eating it centuries later.
The fish most obviously represents Jesus' whole deal, really. That's probably why they suppressed it once it was no longer a movement of the poor but instead a government over them.
