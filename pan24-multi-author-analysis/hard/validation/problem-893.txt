Did you not notice the war in Europe? Russia already started war posturing and invasions in Europe, it's ENTIRELY prudent for countries to prepare for self-defense.
My point is ASEAN countries are going to militarize regardless, and are, because they are facing PLA imperialism in real life, as we speak, not as some hypothetical. It's not a matter of "should we piss China off or not", it's a fact China is already an imperial power trying to weaken their neighbours. Do we do nothing in response to this? Is the question. China is not being "forced" to steal territory actively from their neighbours. But we may be forced to respond.
The ones feeling "cornered" are the much smaller Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia etc that are seeing large swathes of their traditional (and internationally recognized) territorial waters being literally taken over violently by China who claims waters 1000s of KM from their own shores. Or India who has received multiple PRC incursions across previously stable Lines of Actual Control. Or Japan who regularly receives threats from China that it will take over some of their islands. Let alone Taiwan which is under direct pressure not withstanding a possible invasion in the future.
"My neighbours don't want me to be an imperial power" does not mean "cornered". Far too often I hear defenders of China say, "Philippines etc. do not deserve sovereignty because they are lapdogs of the US". Directly justifying Chinese imperialism while painting themselves as victims. I find it funny you argue China is cornered while ignoring China cornering their neighbours.
Thank God we can do pretending China isn't a threat. Probably the greatest thing "W" ever said was that "China is not a strategic ally. They are s strategic enemy.".
In the end, it is. We are the good guys, though we are not angels. We do not conquer. We might wage wars, but we do not annex land. We do not target civilians. We do not wage total war like Russia did. We do not murder journalists. Our leaders do not become the richest men in their country. We have the moral high ground, by comparison.
