They're training themselves away from shame in any way. LBJ passed civil rights in the 1960's in an all white congress with a real nasty shame tactic among other ways. I agree we need tactics other than shame and disdain.
The ONLY appropriate response to the willful idiots on the right is disdain. They are trying to destroy American democracy via both fraudulent and violent means, and refuse to pull their heads out of the sand, as it were, despite numerous and ongoing attempts to explain why their "beliefs" are not only false, but incredibly dangerous and harmful.
"Election deniers" hold their asinine beliefs in spite of ALL evidence. The GOP tried to overthrow the election, not just via a coup attempt at the Capitol, but with a series of 60+ frivolous law suits, ALL of which were rejected by courts across the country due to total lack of merit. Trump's latest suit against HRC and dems was likewise dismissed and accompanied by a heavy bench slapping and the imposition of substantial financial penalties against Trump's lawyers for wasting the courts' time with their sham.
Reason does not work with these fascist morons, and they disdain and slander all sources of information other than corrupt, habitual liar GOP politicians and faux "news" outlets like Fox, Infowars, etc.
