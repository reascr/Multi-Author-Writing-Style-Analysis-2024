Here’s my personal rule for whenever someone advocates replacing Joe Biden in 2024: you need to have a replacement candidate who can win Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
As much as I would prefer someone other than Biden to run (and, preferably, someone further to the left than him), this seems counterproductive without a definable candidate to replace him.
Joe Biden has done an unimaginably better job as president, and as a leader in general, than Trump ever came close to. He is getting things done, making strides for equal justice, applying balm to the economy, and acting as a much better role model and statesman than anyone in the RepubliKKKan Party could even imagine of doing.
He’s old, but he’s also proven that that isn’t a barrier to being a good president. I hope for a younger pool of candidates in the future, but that’s only because I think even more progress than the good that Biden’s brought home could be accomplished with a relative whippersnapper of, say, early Obama’s age.
