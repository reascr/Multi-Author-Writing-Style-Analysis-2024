This is all I'm concerned about. Biden's situation I'm sure will work itself out, but Trump has most certainly committed crimes well beyond and before simply having classified documents. I'm not even saying Biden hasn't broken the law, and he should be dealt with accordingly, but Trump has been a national security hazard and criminal since long before classified documents were found and obstruction was clearly committed to shield them, and this Biden situation should, in no way, get in the way of that case, which seems long overdue.
I 100% agree that there ought to be a reasonable investigation into this but I do have to wonder if any of this matters at all given that Biden is currently the president and therefore has not only the right to have classified information but also the ability to declassify that information.
Because it will 100% be used along with whataboutism to suggest that Biden was going after Trump for the same thing that he was caught doing, regardless of the fact that Biden was not responsible for the investigation into Trump's documents has not been outspoken about the retention of documents, subsequent Lies by his lawyers, and obstruction.
The subsequent "opinion" hosts on Fox instead focused on Biden being uniquely "irresponsible" (and, of course, downplaying the fact that Biden is cooperating with all legal inquiries), but they couldn't lean on their lies about institutional corruption at the White House. Perhaps I am naive, but I think that's a good thing.
