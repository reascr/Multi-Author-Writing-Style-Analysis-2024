But, at the same time, most big countries really have gone through some awful stage where they didn't look so great. Maybe Russia will come out of this and feel awkward for a few years, then gradually turn into a saner country.
Maybe you still have a chance to win, just by continuing to live and knowing that Russia could find another path.
I believe I speak on behalf of everyone in the West when I say, "We are all done with you and yiur vision of the Russia you wish existed. We hope your cancer takes you painfully, yet fast. Fucking die already.".
It is. It was used by Czarist Russia, the USSR, and the Russian Federation multiple times across history.
If "being themselves" means infiltrating and conquering neighbors, that isn't a good trait to cling to. My constructive way to "escape punishment" would be to just...not be aggressive shitheels. It really isn't all that difficult to just not invade your neighbors. Most of humanity manages it these days.
Being done with them does not simply imply destruction. The vast majority of people want nothing to do with Russian antics, and would be over the moon to never have to deal with them again. Putin isn't the source of the "move Russians into a region, have them claim abuse, Russian military invades to support them" bit; it's just a Russian cultural staple no matter their government style.
Setting it up so that any Russian who doesn't love Daddy Vlad and isn't stoked about how things are going at all times must be a western elite and needs to be reported.
