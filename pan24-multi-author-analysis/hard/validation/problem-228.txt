I mean, we should be stupid to not use next Russia's downfall to make it a last Russia's downfall. Why be Peterborough, Region of Russia when you can be Peterborough, an independent country?
Yeah, ofc I meant Petersburg. I said Petersburg because it is very left aligned. Peak designers, peak IT, most LGBT supportive, more progressive community overall. Idk about outcome, but actually developed region with west-align would barely want to continue exist as a part of a broken beyond repair Russia.
Honestly I fear Russia being stupid enough to fuck around with NATO territory believing that the west would just accept military strikes on their land so Russia won't start nuking shit.
- the country that probably least interested in the military conflict with Russia (simply due to it's geography).
Although, this talk is likely pointless, i donâ€™t personally see this happening at all, unless perhaps Ukraine for some reason decides to push into Russian territory, which certainly would be a pivotal point for the world.
Probably it's possible to extrapolate to some extent what is happening in Ukraine to Baltic states (with obviously sad results for them if they will be "on their own"). But it's hard for me even to realize how people imagine the conflict between Russia and Japan.
