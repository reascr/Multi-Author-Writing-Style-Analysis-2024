And even if did, if the EU decides they don't give them money (I hope so, the hungarian people would never see those funds anyway), then they will push it further away.
If Turkey or Hungary believes the alliance doesn't help them or that the other parties wouldn't honor it then it isn't an equal deal. They are both protected by the US who will defend them if anybody attacks, what do they have to gain from tying their fates with 2 more countries?
Finland being attacked and NATO defending them is more probable then somebody not deciding to attack a NATO member because they are scared of the might of Finland. Some country, lets say a country that borders Finland, might delude themselves into thinking NATO won't protect Finland and attack, not really an impossible scenario.
If Finland or Sweden is invaded and they aren't in NATO precisely 0 Turkish or Hungarian soldiers will die for their sake.
How dare those barbarians in Turkey and Hungary not immediately agree to send their countrymen to suffer and die for the sake of Finland! Don't they know that their lives are worth less than swedish lives?
