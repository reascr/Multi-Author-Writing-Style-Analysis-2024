The very same thing happened in the EU announced it's plan to introduce more restrictive gun laws and tried to, literally, ban all semi-auto guns. What makes it especially damning is that even such restriction would have had zero effect on the Paris terrorist attacks those restrictions were supposed to prevent because the terrorists used illegal full-auto AKs from the Balkans.
Yes, I fully agree the 2nd should have been written better. I prefer the Czech version, it grants the "right to defend own life or life of another person also with arms under conditions stipulated by law".
The more idiotic laws you try to implement, the more resistance you'll meet and the US has a long history of idiotic gun laws.
The only idiotoc gun law we have is the second amendment, which was so poorly written than 250 years later 100 million people can't understand that "militia" was required at the time because there was no army. The combination of low intelligence, lacking education and 2A (gun proliferation) will cause the end of the United States, pretty sure of it. Just wait for trump to lose again.
Yes. Was I not clear? Lol I'm not worried about the hearing status of gun owners. Range shooting uses earmuffs anyway. Suppressors are banned because of their possible use in helping commit crimes. Idk how I wasn't clear when I implied that the absolute freedom to own guns was NEVER the intentions of the second amendment?
