I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that a sizable portion of the house could not even explain what they are voting on, what the potential fallout is and what that actually means in reality. To a lot of them it’s probably like Covid or climate change- an abstract concept, and they think it’s being over blown to boot. These are the people that did and do still support trump and listen to his word salad and think “Yeah that makes sense, and I will follow this man”. Also as far as I know this has t happened before, at least not in loving memory. Like a malicious child with a hot stove they aren’t going to even really truly believe that something bad can happen until reality beats them over the head with it.
Did you watch any of the speaker debates? It’s not just Bobo and Marge. Half these morons couldn’t form a coherent statement that was purely political fluff that they had an opportunity to sit down and write.
The GOP propaganda machine is astounding and the GOP base has proven critical thinking isn't something it does.
Nah, if the country defaults, Fox News et Al will frame it as the result of "out of control Dem spending.".
That's what they said. The base is stupid. No doubt the left has its fair share of idiots but the main difference is the GOP is actively courting stupid people.
They've been pulling this childish shit for decades, so there will be no compromise with the Dems as per their stupid fucking "rule".
Problem is the House Republicans play by the unbelievably juvenile Hastert "rule" which says they will only pass a bill if it can pass with Republican votes alone. Considering their razor thin majority, that will be neigh impossible in most cases.
EDIT: rereading your comment, I guess if Dems voted "present" it would technically not be a compromise? God, so fucking childish.
