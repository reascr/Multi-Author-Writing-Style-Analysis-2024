Dmitry Yakushchenko surrendered to Ukrainian forces and was returned to Russian forces in a POW exchange on December 1, 2022. There are videos of him in that POW exchange so we know whatever happened to him must have happened in Russia or in parts of Ukraine under Russian occupation.
Russia/Wagner are again trying to intimidate their canon fodder from surrending to Ukrainian forces by making them think that Russia has people in Ukrainian cities to abduct and kill Russian "traitors".
The Russian soldiers invading Ukraine are deliberately bombing hospitals, schools and any other important civilian locations that they can. They are looting the areas that they occupy, and raping and murdering the population. Russians may not be inherently evil, but they sure do seem pretty keen to carry out every war crime and atrocity that they possibly can.
You can be critical of Putin and the war without resorting to lazy stereotypes and racist suggestions that Russians are inherently evil. That's just Cold War propaganda.
Ha yea, there's a need to dehumanize whoever the enemy currently is for people to feel comfortable about wars being fought. First casualty is truth and all that.
As for shooting their own during World War 2, that is a verified fact. “Not one step back” was an offical motto. There’s also “it takes more courage to retreat than to attack”, which was a well known saying in the Red Army due to retreating soldiers being shot or sent to penal battalions.
