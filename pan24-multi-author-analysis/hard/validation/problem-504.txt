A bunch of the legislators who voted in favor of this bill voted AGAINST outlawing conversion therapy for minors back in 2020.
I just meant that (at least as I understand it) there's some debate over the particulars of just how much different stages of gender transition affect athletic ability - even among people who nevertheless agree that those particulars shouldn't affect whether or not transgender kids are allowed to play sports.
Trans girls (since trans men don't exist to conservatives and TERFs) have existed and played in women's sports for years now with no issue and college and Olympic sports have allowed it even at that level based on findings from medical professionals.
Can I just note that all the trans sports bans always seem to be focused solely on "protecting our girls against competition from biological males", but never the other way, something like "keeping trans busy out of our locker rooms" or something? Edit, got downvoted so let me add that it really says it all, about the control these GOP jackasses need, the control of gender norms and such that is betrayed by their own focus and language under the guise of 'protection.".
It really is. The Republican Party is trying to force LGBTQIA+ people into the closet and later the grave. They don't care about the kids; they never have. Well, at least the kids who aren't white Christian nationalists, at least.
