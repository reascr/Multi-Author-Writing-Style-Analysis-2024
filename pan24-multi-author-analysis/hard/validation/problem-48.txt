I've been making my GTFO of Texas plan and Minneapolis is on my list with Chicago, Denver, the Northeast, and the west coast for placea to look at. My only real concern is that I've heard people are generally pretty closed off insofar as they have their established friend grounds so it's hard to make friends as a transplant.
Realistically just some of the major cities in those areas, but it's easier to just say the Northeast or the West coast instead of specifically listing them. The biggest thing I learned from living in Texas is that I don't want to live anywhere Republicans have a good amount of power.
I lived there before I moved here and spend a few weeks back there every year. Chicago + Illinois have a lot of issues and I consider it less preferable than most of the other places I would consider moving to due to that, but Texas also has serious flaws and is trying to get worse so I don't have any good reason to stay.
