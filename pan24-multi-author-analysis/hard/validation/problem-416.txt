Given how corrupt some of the police are, an intervention might need them to surrender their guns too. This would be a non-starter for the Haitian government.
Those in power enjoy lifestyles that are otherwise unavailable in Haiti. When they're out, there's no parachute - no real business opportunities, and with a corruption or drug scandal, no new policing opportunities. They'll take territory to force aid organizations to pay them, gather up protection money, and so on. But what they really want is to get their clique back in power, so that they can go back to having their jobs and lives. And if you do find yourself in power or policing, you have to find your own clique, or fall victim to the others.
So, it isn't really a matter of good people and bad people, any more than (for example) the Warring States period was about good people and bad people. It's just an impossible situation. To fix the economy you need to fix instability, to fix instability you need to fix corruption and political violence, but to fix corruption and political violence you need to fix the economy.
During the 20th century, there was a cycle where the United States would train and sponsor various groups in Haiti to try to combat the drug trade, but each used their newly acquired power in turn to become the new drug traffickers.
When we talk about gangs in the developed world, we usually have an image in mind that surrounds the north american drug market - underducated and impoverished street vendors who get into wars over sales territory.
