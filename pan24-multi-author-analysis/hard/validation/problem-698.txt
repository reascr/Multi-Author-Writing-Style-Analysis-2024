After the Republican-majority House failed to elect a Speaker on the first ballot [for the first time in 100 years](<.
PBS on YouTube: [House of Representatives resumes vote on next speaker after no one wins majority](<.
- In a surprise upset, a moderate was voted in as Speaker of the State House thanks to all Democratic members and 22 Republicans voting for a moderate Republican. MAGA Republicans were shocked as they assumed they had enough votes to pick a far right leader due to their super-majoriy.^.
- In a tight race for control of the Pennsylvania House as the Republicans held a slim 2 seat majority, several moderate Republicans defected and voted in an independent Democrat as the Speaker.^.
1917 - Republicans won plurality of the seats but 6-year incumbent Democrat Champ Clark wins the Speakership with 217/215 votes on the first ballot after forming a coalition with third party members (Progressive Party, Prohibition Party, Socialist Party).
edit - 1931 was the great depression and the deaths are mostly tied to sickness from what I could find. This was also prior to the 20th amendment, so it was 13 months between election day and the start of the new congress. These are the 14 that died in that 13 month period.
Just thought I make this a top level comment for anyone interested. Someone had asked when the last time (if ever) a majority party selected a speaker from the minority party.
Until a Speaker is selected by obtaining a majority vote, the House cannot conduct any other business. This includes swearing in new members of Congress, selecting members for House committees, paying Committee staff, & adopting a rules package.
