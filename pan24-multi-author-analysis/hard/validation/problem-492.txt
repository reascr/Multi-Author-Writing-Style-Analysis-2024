You're pointing to an interesting (and quite possible) development: Both sides being unable to achieve notable offensive results but for different reasons. The Russians because they don't have the ability to fight a mobile, offensive war for a variety of reasons and Ukraine because they'll have trouble breaking through very heavy layered defenses as you describe.
Once Ukrainians deploy all new tanks and long range missiles, they will make good progress and it seems that they will aim for Crimea first, since for Russians it’s harder to supply Crimea with weapons and ammunition, especially when the bridge is down.
If the push fails they will pretty much be sitting ducks once Ukraine is able to utilize the tanks it received, which is what this general is alluding to.
The reports are conflicting because Russia just launched their much hyped mass mobilization push, but they haven’t achieved any breakthroughs.
It seems like Russia's current offensive is their last attempt at a big offensive... and its already failing. Russia won't be able to gather enough forces for other big offensives in the future. So if their current attack fails, its really just WW1 trench warfare for them until the end.
On the other hand, Ukraine is getting more and more western tech, so with time they will have enough modern arcenal to break russian lines.
