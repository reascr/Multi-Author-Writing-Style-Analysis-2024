If I was 71 and had been embarrassed because I visibly wet myself in front of everyone I would still publicly shame this pathetic piece of shit, the President of South Sudan, for pissing himself in front of the whole world.
If you had asked me about South Sudan’s president 5 minutes ago I woulda had nuthin for ya, but if you ask me now I’d be like ya I saw him piss himself.
You know, I didn't even know or care about Salva Kiir peeing his pants like a little boy, but now that he's being a little bitch about it, I have learned that Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, has peed his pants in public.
From now on, every time I hear the name Salva Kiir, I remember that he is a little boy that pees his pants in public and then throws a temper tantrum against free journalism. Maybe Salva Kiir should consider wearing a diaper next time he drags his incontinent ass out of the nursing home.
His name is Salva Kiir and appearantly he's also a cruel dictator. So make sure you associate the name Salva Kiir with incontinent old people next time you hear it.
