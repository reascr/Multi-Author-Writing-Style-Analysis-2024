Huge commit. Especially the hundreds of armored vehicles. Bulldogs are tracked APCs. Some variants are IFVs.
I hope Australia and Canada send vehicles too. I havenâ€™t heard much new out of Australia in a while. Their bushmasters were popular in Ukraine.
I wonder if the sophisticated missiles are more diverse than Brimstone IIs, but even just hundreds of those is great.
A russian soldier sitting in a S-400 radar will see dozens, if not hundreds of missiles in a short span, all labelled as GRAD missiles. They know these could be HIMARS, but they cannot possibly single out the HIMARS missiles in the bunch and/or shoot all of them down all at once. This way, HIMARS missiles get through even active defense.
The shorter range GMLRS HIMARS missiles keep getting through russian air defense. We meme "what air defense doing" but it's not really a credible meme (/r/ncd in shambles). They get through not because air defenses are inactive, but because the way they are used is abusing the fact that russian air defenses have a cap on how much stuff they can intercept at once.
