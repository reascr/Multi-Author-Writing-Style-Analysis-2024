Correct me if I'm wrong : only the melting of LAND ice would raise the sea level. The SEA ice (floating iceberg) however, regardless of melting or forming, does NOT affect sea level.
Yes, an iceberg is partially submerged and partially above the water. That is because ice is less dense than water.
Unfortunately, you are also incorrect. I stand by my statement, melting sea ice makes no change to sea level. First to make a quick correction, most of the iceberg is below the surface. The density of ice is less than but close to the density of water.
How do we get the ice to float? Displace the equivalent mass in water. How much volume should that be? From above, at the density of water, it needs to displace 100 volume units. That leaves 10 volume units of the ice remaining visible above the surface.
Ice is less dense, so takes up a larger volume, it displaces its weight and then the rest is above the waterline.
Plus the whole bit of the iceberg (most of it) which is above the water, and will become water, adding to you know, the general amount of water. Far outweighing any water displacement. This is why boats don't make sea levels rise by any significant, measurable factor. Adding lots of melted ice (water) does indeed however, increase the amount of water.
