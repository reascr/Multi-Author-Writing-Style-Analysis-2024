This has been going through the courts for around 2 years. It's the court ruling that's just come out in favour of the settlers, seizing the land and evicting the palestinians who've been leasing it from the church and living there for 70 years.
The property owners themselves are evil anti-jews because......they own it and they made a complaint that their property rights were compromised?
Jews bought land in East Jerusalem, this is a crime punishable by death in Palestine, so Palestinians and their friends are outraged.
furthermore, Israel does not belong to the palestinians. (actually, neither does the west bank - i.e. Judea/samaria. it is the land they supposedly want, but they refuse to actually accept it. The palestinians have been offered a country numerous times, and constantly refuse. ).
Israel, like every other country, grants privileges to its citizens, that non-citizens are not entitled to. Palestinians are not Israeli.
20% of Israelis are arabs, with full rights. Members of the government, judiciary, medical fields, bus drivers, tech workers, etc... They vote. They pay Israeli taxes. They have Israeli passports. Nothing like south africa. How many blacks doctors were treating white patients? How many black judges would decide a case for a white defendant?
There was a trial, and then a ruling. The new tenants won the court case, and were taking possession of there land. I would think most people would like things to work within the legal system, and not just a free for all.
