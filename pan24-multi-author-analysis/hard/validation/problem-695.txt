Agreed. Mueller said he was guilty but he used limp dick wording: “If we believed the president did not commit a crime, we would have said so," allowing his old pal Barr to bury it with a bullshit memo.
Trump is a Russian traitor attempting to burn the Law of the DOJ and our Constitution. Others pretend he is innocent. That is why we should have had the ability to weigh the evidence in our court of Law.
It if you want hands down proof that this is different then you need to know what constitutes a special counsel. It can ONLY be assigned by the attorney general or acting attorney general.
Mueller was appointed by deputy attorney general rod rosenstien. The only reason they used a special counsel is because they didn’t trust trump after he fire James Comey.
More over (and what most people don’t realize) is the mueller prove started long before the public knew about it. It started as an fbi probe called ).
He basically said he did it but not enough proof to surpass reasonable doubt. Also the investigation resulted in charges against 34 individuals and 3 companies, 8 guilty pleas, and a conviction at trial.
A total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates and campaign officials.
