Where in the name of all of fuck do the Chinese get the unmitigated gall to protest a damn thing here? And where the hell are any Western leaders standing up to call them out on their bullshit? I swear, their post shoot-down whining pisses me off five times more than sending the thing to start with. Not to mention our pathetically craven response from day one.
I think these Chinese balloon and protests are literally... literally... tests to see just how much contempt they can pour onto perceived adversaries before they summon at least some tiny, scraggly, droopy little balls to actually push back.
I wonder how China's 'civilian research' balloons always get drifted towards countries hostile to China and especially above areas that are of interest to the CCP....
I read another article stating something along the lines of Japan reserves the right to shoot down chinese spy balloons after U.S. sets precedence. And that they have had "chinese weather balloons" fly over their sensitive areas in the past.
Many UFO sightings have been proven to be weather or even party balloons. When you’re in a plane moving quickly or when clouds are moving quickly balloons can appear to be moving quickly or in weird ways.
Imagine seeing this in contrast to fast moving low flying clouds and not understanding it’s 8 mile above them. You could easily mistake it’s speed to be insane.
