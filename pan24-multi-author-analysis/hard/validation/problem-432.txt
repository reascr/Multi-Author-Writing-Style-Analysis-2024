For anyone playing along at home, this is more about the Tories billionaire donors. All those russian oligarchs, whose unsanctioned children have massive uk property portfolios have been in their ear telling them the way to do things, then these donors go and make demands of politicians.
This is on the tories who have been turning a blind eye for decades to all of that money stolen from the Russian people that they oligarchs keep donating to the party coffers.
Also kind of on the people that keep voting for the Tories even though itâ€™s very well known how corrupt they are and they they have taken payments from the KGB in the past.
Compared to the well-documented and reported actual corruption of the Tories with regard to the steady stream of Russian money and influence on the party and British politics as a whole... it's a rounding error.
Remember, Johnson was pathologically incapable of doing the right thing, and still made a large contribution in govt to Ukraine in spite of his near-direct connections to the Russian state and his glad acceptance of Russian influence in British politics for several years.
It's interesting you linked sources that support Corbyn in your denigration of him. Someone on the back benches giving ideological interviews to outside orgs isn't the same as that person leading a cabinet of (necessarily) diverse viewpoints.
It's likely he would have embarrassed us a bit by being slow to aid Ukraine, but calling him a Russian stooge is a bit much.
