In Iraq one Challenger 2 had its drivers sight damaged and threw a track, according to wikipedia "It was hit by 14 rocket-propelled-grenades from close range and a MILAN anti-tank missile. The crew survived, safe within the tank until it was recovered for repairs, the worst damage being to the sighting system. It was back in operation six hours later. According to British army, one Challenger 2 operating near Basra survived being hit by 70 RPGs in another incident".
How much of an issue is it that it may not hold up against the very newest anti tank capabilities, when so much of what the Russians are fielding is ageing Soviet hardware?
I wouldn't totally rule out that Russia would supply some personnel with more up-to-date equipment to defeat western tanks, should we see these tanks end up in Ukraine. We know they have better stuff than what they're fielding, but, somebody in Russia clearly doesn't see the point in bringing out what few new toys they have yet.
It shouldn't make a whole lot of difference against the equipment we're seeing Russia field in Ukraine. I think it was even mentioned that they're not even providing tank crews with their most up-to-date APFSDS and sticking to older types.
Also those tanks not being modernised may be useful for spare parts for the ones that have been modernised.
