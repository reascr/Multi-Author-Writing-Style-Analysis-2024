This is a dumb argument. That’s like saying that the human body is ugly because we wear clothes that accentuate our best features. All kinds of food are tasty. That includes vegan foods and animal products, some of which are among the best foods I’ve ever tasted, but have you never tried a good ribeye?
Very true. We’re past the point of undoing the damage and are rapidly approaching the point of mitigating the consequences of our damage. Now we have the choice to stop making it worse or lean in on destroying the planet for profits.
I agree that dropping the worst foods is a win both for health and the planet. I prefer to live in a world with billions of people that are 'as vegan aas possible' rather than one with millions of actual vegans.
Let's utilize a natural resource responsibly and as ethically as we can and not pretend that vegan is even close accessible for billions of humans. Nor pretend that vegan industry is currently anymore green or less harmful than meat.
I agree with you that it’s impossibly impractical at this stage to convince people around the world to stop eating meat.
I thought that I would never stop eating meat but here I am more than one year into veganism. People change.
