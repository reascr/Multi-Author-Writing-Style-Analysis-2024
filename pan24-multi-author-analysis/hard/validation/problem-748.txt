His actual comment from the article sounds more like a wager. That he was so sure no democrat would switch to vote in a moderate Republican and undermine him.
If that's what he'll do with a moderate GOP, what would he do if they elected a moderate democrats as speaker.
“If Democrats join up to elect a moderate Republican, I will resign from the House of Representatives. That is how certain I am. I can assure your viewers that won’t happen.”.
This reads to me similar to an "I'll eat my hat" statement so no even if it happened he probably wouldn't actually resign.
In the article he's not saying it as a threat. If you read the quote, he's saying that he's so confident democrats aren't going to budge that he'd resign if they did.
He didn't actually threaten to resign, he said he's so certain Democrats won't reach across the aisle to circumvent Gaetz & co, he'll resign if they do. He's just posturing, and everyone knows he doesn't have the backbone to follow through on such a promise. Pretty disappointing after reading that headline, but at this point, I'm the asshole for taking a headline in r/politics at face value lol.
Damn, why'd you have to get my hopes up? He's just posturing to try to reassure his constituents that he's not being a useful idiot for Democrats. There's zero chance he'd actually follow through on this if a more moderate Republican were to get elected.
