Disclaimer: fuck FIFA, fuck Qatar, fuck their attempts at justifying screwing over people and countries.
So if you actually care about these things, hold FIFA just as culpable as Qatar, and stop supporting them.
Like Qatar getting the World Cup is immediate bullshit. It's a country most never heard of with no history of sporting success in a blistering hot desert. At least Russia is plausible but Qatar? No.
But nope. No spines here! Same shit as always. These cultures don't respect civility, they see it as a weakness to be exploited, they see it as you being a gullible idiot that they'd be a fool NOT to exploit and abuse. Same as with russians.
What pisses me off, as someone who've lived a year in Saudi, is that if the west/Fifa just had a spine they'd easily run over qatars bullshit, they're so focused on image that they'd never be able to jail several hundred people wearing rainbowflags. But instead we have our own godamn governments and football-clubs licking the balls of qatari shitheads, asking people to adapt to these bullshit rules. Since people are sheep, they then follow that.
Had Germany, UK, France and Italy said "fuck off" you think Fifa or qatar would still enforce the rules? It'd be a world historic failure of qatar if they did so they'd ofcourse change course and let people have fun.
