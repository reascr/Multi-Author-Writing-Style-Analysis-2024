As a Michigander, I can tell y'all that the only reason the Democrats won BIG this midterm was because we passed a prop that has an independent body draw up the voting districts. This is the entire reason why for the first time in almost 40 years Michigan has a blue legislature.
Michigan is fully constrolled state-wide by Dems for the first time in 40ish years. Minnesota is now in a similar place. There is a good possibility the state house of PA will still end up Democrat despite gerrymandering.
We weren't supposed to have a chance of holding anything in Congress. The odds are in favor of Dems keeping the Senate, even without the runoff election that even skeptics are placing in Warnocks favor. Hell, we may even still keep the House, and the fact that that is even a conversation is insane. If the Republicans win the House, it will now be by a razor-thin minority, with a lot of new blood entering the house being Progressive dems and Trump-critical Republicans. That means the possibility of cross aisle collaboration on certain issues.
While it is still too early to celebrate the best case scenario possible coming true, you really are scraping the barrel looking for bad news if you aren't overjoyed by this outcome. The rust belt has significantly come out Blue, with bl8e state legislatures in place to prevent a whole lot of fuckery in 2024. Given the Moore decision slated to be ruled on at the end of the year by the SCOTUS, this could not be a bigger victory.
Progressive ballot measures passed in half a dozen states, including abortion rights enshrined into state constitutions and multiple more legalizing weed or hallucinogenics.
