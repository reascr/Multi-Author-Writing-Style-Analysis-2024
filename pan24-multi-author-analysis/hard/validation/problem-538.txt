Did the Biden administration take any steps to attempt to change anything? The question of whether they could have done anything is a separate one, I'm wondering if there's anything to show they even tried.

Profit seeking businesses are going to seek profits in every way we allow them to. The only way we can stop things like this happening is by creating regulations and laws that outlaw the negligence that allowed it to happen and then enforcing those laws. Trump and Biden both deserve plenty of blame for failing to do that.
With his role backs on safety regulations, yeah he is more to blame that Biden. I swear, all Republicans are doing is just rigging everything to be as dangerous as possible and when it fails blame the Democrats.
Not saying republicans aren't as much to blame here, clearly they are. But we could have stopped this. Democrats CHOSE not to. ....because the economy.
