Ukrainian defenders destroyed a bridge over the Molochna River near Melitopol'. It was on the supply route for Russian invasion forces in Zaporizhzhya region.
Russia has already strategically lost this war, Putin just can't admit it or he'd end up like Gadaffi.
Surely by now everyone can agree that Russia has strategically lost this war? How does Russia expect to compete with a western supplied Ukraine in the long term?
It’s okay for now because Ukraine can play for time in a way that Russia can’t. Which is why I think we see the current dynamic of Russia deploying its very best and very active all up and down the line. Thousands of losses over past week. Not sustainable long-term. They needed huge momentum for the cost they are paying. These incremental gain are not enough. Ukraine can keep this up, more aid will come, and the gap between the militaries will only grow.
If the West sends F-16s then they are essentially giving Ukraine a reach that extends that of the HIMARS. What other option is there? The aircraft can fly deep into enemy territory and launch its missiles there. Even if the West gives missiles with a range of 80km, the same rules don't apply as with the HIMARS. Aircraft are more flexible.
