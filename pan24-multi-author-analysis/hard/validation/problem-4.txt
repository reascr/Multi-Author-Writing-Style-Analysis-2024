I doubt U.S. military-engineers are capable of quickly refurbishing Soviet tech when they've been taught to work on US-made vehicles. The Czech Republic and The Netherlands are NATO states, so it's very in-line for what these countries are providing for Ukraine.
NATO was formed to protect NATO members, Ukraine is not a NATO member so i don't quite see the relevance here. Regardless, a lot of NATO countries are helping Ukraine, not just USA.
The US is in the best position financially and militarily to help and aid Ukraine. Who in turn helps solidify the security of Europe. If the war goes well for Ukraine, there will be a big surge of investors and economical boom right around the corner.
Europe is an important ally for the USA. USA is investing this money in Ukraine who in turn is demilitarizing Russia, our "Rival" as they have wanted to be classified. USA has no immediate threats, and can send all these arms and money over as the rate of return on these mean a less threatening Russia who wouldn't be able to project it's power in the near future to their other neighbors. A stable world is ideal for trade, a war at the doorstep of Europe signals threat to everyone in that market.
All the other countries are aiding with what they can. You have to account that most are also bolstering up their own defences since the threat is way closer than it is to the US. So there is military and financial aid that they can't provide if they are preparing.
