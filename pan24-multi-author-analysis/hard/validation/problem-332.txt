You can boil everything down to it's basic roots. Pretending that culture isn't important is really, really dumb. If culture doesn't matter then we are less than human.
I’m not saying culture isn’t important, I’m just saying we’ve evolved past the use of traditions that don’t serve a purpose. It’s not like I’m saying that names don’t have origins, just that those origins don’t prevent usage outside of one’s gender. I don’t buy the argument that a gendered name allows for the listener to know a persons gender because there are plenty traditionally gender neutral names and it’s never an issue. That’s why we have pronouns.
Yes I understand that, and I’m saying there’s no reason to adhere to those associations when they are now obsolete. What we consider to be current “gender neutral names” proves my point.
Names are just specific sounds we assign to people, there’s no rule that says certain names HAVE to be male or female, just like clothing. I’ve met female Michaels and male Leslies, it’s uncommon sure but honestly it’s kind of silly that we assign gender to names.
You're just misunderstanding what people mean by "male names" and "female names". They're not saying that there is some universal rule that determines whether a name is male or female. They are saying that those names are associated with men or women in the culture that is being talked about.
