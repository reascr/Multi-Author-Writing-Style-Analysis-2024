That's just shy of the daily death toll for the British army in World War 1, when we had four million men in the army alone fighting across five major fronts on three continents.
Assuming that the Russians really do have 300k men in Ukraine, that's a per capita loss rate equivalent to six times the loss rate for the British army at the height of the Somme offensive.
With Russia losing ground and gains at such rapid pace, all over Ukraine, did they lose all of their trained professional soldiers (spetnaz, paratroopers etc)?
Then again one could argue that the entire Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv fronts were the Russian forces blundering far beyond their supply lines and meeting similar fates.
If the Ukrainians are seriously already threatening Chaplynka less than a week after liberating Kherson city, they might go all the way to Melitopol from the west.
We were all assuming Ukraine would regroup to the Zaporizhzhia front and attack towards Tokmak/Melitopol from the north. Well I guess if they can get over the river on pontoons (!), they can just keep hitting the Russians from the west. I suppose this could also be a feint, with the main thrust coming from Zapo still. But what a development.
