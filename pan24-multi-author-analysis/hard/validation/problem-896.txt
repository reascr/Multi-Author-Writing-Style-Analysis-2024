The headline is very misleading. The actual statement from the authorities is that four(!) girls have received asylum due to their gender, not that any girl/woman coming to Denmark is promised anything.
Im Danish and you are right in that they are not promised anything. There will still be checks and controls - but at the moment the headline is correct. It will be eligible for all Afghan woman and girls.
Afghan Taliban culture is not only forced onto the girls. It's also forced onto the boys. It is is forced up them by men. It's also forced upon them by women.
It's misandry if there is no proces for women, but there is for men. I.e. women are let in without a process, men have to jump through hoops to get the same thing.
Imagine owning a bar and let in white people without asking questions, but all black people will have to go through a process to get in. They have to answer some questions, do some tests et cetera. I think it is fairly obvious that is not a fair system.
It is all about making sure all humans are treated fairly. That doesn't mean the outcome is always the same.
Everyone going through the same process doesn't mean the result is the same. Let's say I own a business and I need some employees to do some data entry. I don't really care about your education, looks, gender or what not. All I want is that you are accurate at data entry. So everyone can apply, and everyone gets the same data entry assessment where you need to do some data entry. Some pass, some fail. I hire the ones that pass. Everyone had to go through the same process and meet the same requirements. But that didn't mean the end result was the same for all.
