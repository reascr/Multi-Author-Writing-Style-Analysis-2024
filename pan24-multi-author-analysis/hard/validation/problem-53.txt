Everytime you pay for something with the dollar, you're making a transaction under god. While it doesn't say which religion this implies, it does however imply that deification is the guiding principle by which this operates.
And then you have to look at the demographic majority in religion in this country, and connect the dots.
Because it says "in god we trust" on our currency, and every speech is ended with "and God bless the United States of America.".
There is a way around all of this. A way to not have to debate these freaks because they will never relent. It is to label them correctly and start a nationwide movement against them. They are a communist cult. They are using religion to cover the fact that their 7 mountains plan to control every aspect of our lives is almost exactly the communist manifesto. Just called by another name and using religion to cover it up. They absolutely worship valdmir putin and think his jurderous war raping children blowing apart children stealing children is fighting for a pro life society against western values. Communism has always been in a Culture war with western values. The republicans want to turn this county into communist Russia. It’s time to stop being so nice before it’s too late. These are commies. That all they are. They aren’t Christian’s they aren’t religious.
