Edit There have been several thoughtful replies to this that assert that the Supreme Court was citing the major questions doctrine and trying to restrict over reach by the EPA, claiming that the previous regulations embodied in the Clean Power Plan (CPP) encroached on the power of Congress.
> Rather, my argument is that the Court has begun to implement the policy preferences of its conservative majority in a new and troubling way: by simultaneously stripping power from every political entity except the Supreme Court itself. The Court of late gets its way, not by giving power to an entity whose political predilections are aligned with the Justices’ own, but by undercutting the ability of any entity to do something the Justices don’t like. We are in the era of the imperial Supreme Court.
Is there any real legal power from holding the title "chief justice" on SCOTUS? Or is it just a ceremonial title and the chief justice has the same legal power as the other 8 justices?
There are _no_ courts who have the authority to rule on the actions of the Supreme Court. And yet, we have a very long standing tradition that no man is a king, that no one may rule in their own case.
Worse, what do you do if the Supreme Court itself then rules that the attempts to add those justices is illegal?
We could try to just add more justices to the court, but... That's not a solution. It will be widely seen as just packing the court to win, not any kind of attempt at restoring the rule of law.
