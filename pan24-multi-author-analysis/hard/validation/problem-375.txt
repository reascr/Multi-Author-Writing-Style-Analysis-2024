Yes I do agree it's a sentiment widespread across most Western democracies, people want to vote to impact those they see as a barrier to their success, mostly, completely wrongly. Examples that are quite common are 'migrants are taking our jobs' or migrants are taking all the good jobs' or X-ethnic group are causing all the crime.
Thank you for sharing, we can't choose our family or the society we grow up in. I departed Christianity early so it's good to be reminded of the power it has over so many. Social mores kind of self perpetuate and often attract an adherence verging on reverence. "Alcohol is good" "We've always done it this way" "Us X'ers have always been tough" etc etc. Undoubtedly this is part of the paradox of why so many vote for politicians that stand against their rights and welfare.
These horrible Republicans deserve each other, but the country certainly doesn't deserve them, and can't afford them, with all their time wasting nonsense..
I think a better way to say it would be "a grossly overpaid puppet for lying politicians sponsored by corporations to ratfuck our politics and screw the American people so they can make another buck for themselves".
“As in, there’s an elected official who has appeared to have lied about literally everything, and broke a lot of campaign finance laws, and is somehow allowed to keep making laws?”.
Follow up questions should have been "Is Congress broken because pathological liars like Santos and get elected with no consequences because people like you sidestep questions about accountability?".
