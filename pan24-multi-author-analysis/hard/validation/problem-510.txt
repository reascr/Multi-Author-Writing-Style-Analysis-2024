Mass imprisonment and executions have been used by Russia, China, N Korea, and other nations to effectively control their country. It looks like they're banking of the making an example approach. 15K is relatively small when it comes to government mass executions, but announcing the executions vs disappearing people is relatively uncommon. If this were China, they'd publically execute 3 people and quietly execute 100K over this protest all the while claiming they champion human rights, but I guess Iran has a different culture.
Iran has issued death sentences to a handful protestors in the past according to Human Rights Watch, however, itâ€™s unclear if they were ever carried out.
Iranian lawmakers have, in recent days, called for strict punishments for the protesters who have been arrested. On Monday, CNN reported that a letter signed by 227 members of the Iranian parliament urged that the protesters be given harsh punishment that "would serve as a good lesson in the shortest possible time.".
"Now, the public, even protesters who are not supportive of riots, demand from the judiciary and security institutions to deal with the few people who have caused disturbances in a firm, deterrent, and legal manner," Iranian government spokesman Masoud Setayeshi said, according to Reuters.
2) Iranians will understand that peaceful protests are ridiculous and the only way this government will be forced to listen if if violence breaks out against their leadership and military/policing forces.
1) Iranians will do nothing of merit as 15,000 protestors are executed and will allow themselves to be oppressed for the foreseeable future even worse than they were after the changes made in the 70s.
"In the last 8 weeks Iran's regime has killed over 300 protestors, imprisoned nearly 15,000, and threatened to execute hundreds more, yet Iran's women persist," Sadjadpour wrote in a tweet. "Today female university students removed their forced hejab and chant, 'I am a free woman.'".
