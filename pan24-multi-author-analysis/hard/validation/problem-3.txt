Sorry bud, if a party defines itself around people who cheerlead for terrorism, then anybody voting for them is a terrorist sympathizer. The word for an "apolitical" German in 1938 is "Nazi".
The trend I’ve been seeing is that anyone who voted conservatively is a Nazi, or Nazi sympathizer, etc. I get it, there are shitty people who vote Republican. The problem is change can be a slow moving process. It’s gonna take a while for people to become more accepting of other peoples lifestyles. It’s not gonna happen overnight, and I just wish more people would understand that.
Dude, still can’t see your full reply and still don’t know what you’re talking about. Don’t know what you’re insinuating either. Third times a charm maybe. Lolls.
Lolls. I love my family, no matter what their political affiliations are, and so should everyone else. Also, what a shitty passive aggressive thing to say. No where in this thread do I mention my family. Damn, get your life together dude.
Holy shit,why edit out the last part of your message?? Are you ashamed you even wrote it?? That was a little too far, even for you, huh?? That’s really horrible to say to someone.
