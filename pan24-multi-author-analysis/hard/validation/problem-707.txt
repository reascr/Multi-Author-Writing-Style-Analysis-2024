I hate that we're still treating elections like a football game. The score predictions, the talk of hail maries. This shit is not a game. We are at the actual, no-joke, precipice of fascism. And there's nowhere to run off to. A Republican-controlled US that is aligned with Russia will absolutely change the entire world order for the worst. Israel is back with Netanyahu. Brazil barely scraped by. Orban keeps consolidating power. Italy elected an actual neofascist as president. Global democracy is on its way out, and a GOP takeover will snuff the flame for at least a generation.
Yep, we are at the end of the road when you have people running for office saying things like they'll never let the GOP lose if they're elected. Well, that's not really good for democracy, is it?
In the final weeks of the race, Rudy Giuliani ignited a media campaign alleging that the computer’s hard drive contained e-mails and pictures of Hunter Biden that compromised his father. Guo has denied involvement in disseminating disinformation about the laptop, but leaked messages suggest that he coördinated his followers to edit images and to spread the story. Three days before the election, Bannon met with Guo’s supporters and applauded their “editorial creativity over the pictures,” according to a recording provided to Mother Jones. Bannon said that the laptop story stalled Biden’s momentum and “drove up his negatives,” which kept the race close enough that Trump could declare victory, whether or not he went on to win. “That’s our strategy,” Bannon told them. “So, when you wake up Wednesday morning, it’s going to be a firestorm.”.
The Trump campaign had heard of the laptop during the summer, when a man from Delaware reached out to say that it had been abandoned at his repair shop. The first known public mention of it came on September 25th, from a guest on the YouTube channel of Wang Dinggang, one of Guo’s collaborators. The guest claimed that explicit material on the laptop was “recorded by the C.C.P.” and had “arrived mysteriously in America” to provide the Party with leverage over Joe Biden as he ran for President. Some of Guo’s allies followed up by creating and spreading fabricated images, according to Jack Maxey, a former co-host of Bannon’s podcast. “It was a huge deflection from reality,” Maxey recalled. “I said to Steve on Day One, ‘This is a bad idea.’ ” But, he added, “I can’t tell Steve what to do. Apparently, Miles can.”.
Gerrymandering and voter suppression was taking too long for the impatient GOP party; now they're just admitting they're going to steal, or deny, all future elections. Which truly means it's time for some sort of split in America. The GOP and sane, decent, mindful, empathetic Americans cannot exist under the same flag, rules, or laws.
