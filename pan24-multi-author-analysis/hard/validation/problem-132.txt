Georgia could impose the death penalty on anyone giving water to anyone in line to vote because the water-giver was undermining democracy. Over the top? Look as the collection of Republican clowns with flamethrowers in the US House of Representatives before answering that question.
Complete elimination of ALL CRIME is unrealistic. Lots of offenders believe they won't get caught. They'd still commit the crime even if the potential penalty were death.
To be clearer, if both child rape and child murder carry the death penalty, what's the downside to eliminating the main witness after rape?
The death penalty for child rapists sounds appropriate, and I do believe these people have high recidivism rates, and are not to be trusted around children in any way. However, I also see the reasoning that if child rape carried the same penalty as murder, some of them would just kill the child to get rid of the victim so they can't be witnesses.
Gotta say I don’t have any sympathy for unanimously convicted child rapists receiving the death penalty if a super majority of a jury of their peers voted for it.
He says this topic is about a certain thing, you insist it’s actually about something else completely, and the justification is essentially “trust me”.
