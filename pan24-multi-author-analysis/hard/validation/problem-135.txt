A lot of Palestinians were murdered during the Nabka, so you might have a hard time saying "this is 100% how this particular family was murdered", but make no mistake the Nabka was a horrible, deadly thing.
A portion of the Palestinian population of Israel got mad at the nation being formed, attacked the Jewish population, lost the fight and rather than executing all of them, some of whom had family who'd be neighbors to the people who would be killed, they were exiled to preserve the peace.
People claiming the nabka is ethnic cleansing are the ones trying to justify ethnic cleansing of Jewish people in the middle east in 1948 and on.
For all intents and purposes, the 1948 Nakba was a genocide of Palestinians, or at the very least an ethnic cleansing. Yet, sadly, very few dare to call it as such, despite it bearing the hallmarks of such a definition; it was deliberate, and it intended to destroy the Palestinian Arab ethnicity in part or in whole by expelling them from their homes and destroying hundreds of their villages and towns, leading to the shattering of their society. This lead to the creation of permanent Palestinian refugees with no right of returning to their homes.
If I recall correctly the Jordanian excuse was to give housing to the mass of Palestinian refugees they now had to deal with.
That isn't ethnic cleansing that is mass instability caused by mass immigration and sudden demographic change causing hate and unrest in the populace leading to atrocities like the riots. Blame of which rests on the British authorities.
And the instability was the Hebron massacre and the wave of racial violence in the decades leading up to the 1947 civil war, of which both sides committed atrocities.
The nakba also predates the 1948 war, it was started during the 1947 civil war. Do yourself a favor and actually read up on Israels history.
