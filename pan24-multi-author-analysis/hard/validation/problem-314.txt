and for a good reason, the role of control and regulation falls on the state, and failure to act in face of irregularities is a failure of the state, not a failure in protecting individual action.
protecting individual action is either unrealizable because the name of the whistleblower will be out there and discrimination is very hard to prove, or will lead to even worse ideas like being able to report wrongdoing anonymously, opening the door to all kind of malfeasance.
The problem is that there's no clear definition of who counts as a whistleblower and how to protect them against legal action from their employer (which could also be the government). The law was written with Snowden in mind, not some guy at VW who notices his company cheating emissions tests. There's also no clear way for whistleblowers to get their information out without breaking other laws (like data privacy or treason). And last but not least: companies can still fire you for being a whistleblower if they want to - it just has to go through an arbitration process first. Which means you'll lose your job either way unless you have enough money saved up for a lawyer.
So yeah, we're working on it but it's gonna take time because this shit is complicated af and needs careful consideration before passing any new law here. Meanwhile our economy is suffering because investors don't trust us anymore after Dieselgate and nobody wants to build factories here.
I'm from Germany and I have no idea what the EU is talking about. Whistleblower protection laws were passed in 2017, but they are so bad that even the government had to admit it can't be implemented as intended. So we're working on a new draft right now, which should be ready by next year.
