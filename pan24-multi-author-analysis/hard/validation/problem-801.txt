I mean, yeah: There are all sorts of creepy issues hovering there in the background. There are all sorts of things that could happen in the future.
There's actually going to be a few more in the coming years. One is going to be around the moon for artemis and if space-x ever gets their starship going it's big enough to be considered a space station all by itself.
Itâ€™s exciting to see others on our planet reaching to space to be able to add to the competitive nature that has been part of space exploration since Sputnik first launched so long ago.
And maybe they'll eventually put a nuclear space laser up there, and that will be really scary, but, for now, to me, it's still kind of cool when people go into space for any purpose.
Hey, China: Congratulations. Hope this time of hostility blows over and you get to have fun doing cool, peaceful things with your space station.
Russian astronaut on space station sees a coke set out with a straw and a little note for cosmonauts. All Chinese astronauts keep giggling and waiting for one of them to drink it.
