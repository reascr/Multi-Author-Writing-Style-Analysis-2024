Considering narcotics history in warfare I wouldn't be surprised if it's more than alcohol, alcohol can be used for stuff like this, but it's much less reliably effective than say amphetamines which is what the nazis used.
Of course, as I said in another comment I wasnt intending to say that the allies or any of the other participants didn't use them, just that there is a ton of notes about the nazis drug cocktail being important to their initial speed.
Absolutely, didn't mean to imply that only nazis used it, they are just a prime example of drug cocktails for soldiers. There are some historians that attribute the blitzkriegs speed to that drug cocktail, hence my focus on them.
I was going to say, drug use has been rampant in war for millennia, on pretty much all fronts. To this day, US SF are still issued what's essentially Adderall but with some special modifications. How do you think they stay awake for 3-4 days at a time?
It's apparently something classified that isn't technically amphetamines but has the same effect. They take pills that they aren't legally allowed to talk about.
