When drugs can be used for profit due to scarcity and illegality, nobody is safe. There are 2 solutions, legalization and government production of all drugs which removes incentive for any cartel by killing profitability, or extreme and anonymous violence designed to eliminate them, and the option to implicate rival cartel against each other. But neither will happen, drugs are part of the justification for the police state, without drugs, the only reason for crime is the poverty capitalism creates by exploitation.
But we were already on the topic of cartels… besides, as I’ve now learned, drug trafficking is a big part of the corruption there anyways. Maybe not in this case, but still.
I mean if you look at the casualties on both sides of the Mexican drug war it certainly seems like they aren’t in bed together like what’s being implied. Cartels have been a huge problem all over South America for decades, it’s not like it’s just Mexico. I don’t know, I mean I’m the type of guy to be inclined to believe that 9/11 and JFK were conspiracies, I certainly don’t think it’s natural for any government to really care about its citizens, but still these cartels have held so much power for so long, it seems like it would be hard to deal with. I don’t really know shit though.
I didn’t read the article until now, I retract my statements. Still though as a layman I think the only clear solution to all of this Mexico nonsense lies in the actions of the US who enables the drug trade in the first place. There’s only a couple clear ways to do to cut them off, legalizing all drugs or strenhening the border. Pick your poison, because this problem ain’t going nowhere.
