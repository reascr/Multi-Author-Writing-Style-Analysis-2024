The Czechs, Poles, and Lithuanians (not to mention a few others) know what it is like to be under Russia's oppression. They don't want to ever be back there again.
They don't want to see it. It's just kind of a bummer that even younger generation tends to believe state news and TV even though you can imagine they are spreading straight fake news there.
It's not putin blasting houses with MLRS', I suppose? Not putin flying in strategic bombers targeting electric power grids and malls, right? Get this point out of your head - ruzzian nation wants to destroy Ukrainians. It doesn't matter who rules, ruzzians always wanted to suppress and eliminate Ukraine.
I am not asking questions about Germans and British, 'cause they are not the people raping and killing my people. I am asking questions about and most important TO ruzzians, and the answers are not great. So, yeah, people bred on Soviet Union and ruzzian Empire glory cannot be in any case adequate, because their history includes killing of Ukrainians and the thesis of "brotherly nation - one nation", which is complete bullshit.
I mean, with that logic, can we say that ruzzian empire and soviet union were just brainwashed and ruzzians didn't want to assimilate, suppress and destroy Ukrainian nation for like....300-400 years? I doubt.
