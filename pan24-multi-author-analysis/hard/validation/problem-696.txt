maintaining an occupation for over 50 years, not giving them a country or full rights, night raids daily, roadblocks to limit mobility from family and neighbors, no right to vote, embargo, both financial and of goods, the bi-yearly war, killing thousands of children, taking territory by force and not giving it back for decades.
why would any of these terror groups want to hurt israel or the israeli ppl if they have well functioning society, a good life, work, etc.if israel invested money in the new palestinian state, built universities and schools, let them come work in israel and vice versa, invested in businesses there and mingled their economies together, how, and why, would anyone want the other's downfall.
Out of curiosity, how do you think Israel could disengage from the West Bank and Gaza without also empowering the militant groups funded by foreign nations which reside there?
Even if Israel operated in complete good faith with the disengagement (I know, already dubious), these militant groups are funded by foreign nations and organizations which donâ€™t seem to care as much about the Palestinian people as much as harming Israel. How would such disengagement be different when they left Gaza, which only seemed to empower right wing xenophobic groups on both sides?
israelis have a tendency to completely ignore what we are doing in the west bank and gaza as if its some other worldly place that just doesnt count? no matter what excuses u wanna give yourself for the reason we keep doing it, we still DO IT, we choose to do that, and we dont have to.
