Or you have Seattle that taxes sugared sodas, "juices" (not 100% juice) and teas but not milk-based products.
I think taxing soda's and other sugary drinks is a good idea. The rate of obesity has drastically increased over the years, and continues to increase. Sugar consumption cost the world over $150 billion in dental work. Over 73,000 amputations per year due to diabetes. Countries like Mexico and Argentina statistically drink soda more than any other country, but there are many many many other countries that are close to their number. It hurts to see so many people die because of sugar, and this is why I agree that soda's and other sugar drinks should be taxed.
One of those articles makes the argument that people shouldn’t be allowed to use food stamps for soda which I’m not sure how I feel about.
In all seriousness though, it’s sort of depressing for these people but I don’t know if a soda tax would help them. Unless it was put towards some sort of community dental care?
I drank a ton of Mountain Dew when I was younger and in a really really bad place mentally (like 2-3 cans a day) now I’m missing 3 molars because by the time I could afford to do anything about it they were too far gone and I’ve spent thousands on dental care in the past few years. I’ve joked to my dentist that I have meth mouth with out the fun parts of doing meth.
