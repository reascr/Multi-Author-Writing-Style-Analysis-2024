Democrats are famously addicted to failure. They’ve shaken it a little recently, but I’d be shocked if they have the ability to be strategic, and I say that as someone who supports democrats.
I know, I’m sorry I was being sarcastic, I’m just frustrated because sometimes it feels like democrats are putting their efforts into mundane elections where they have very little base. In missouri our two largest cities are blue and the democrats barely know what they’re doing here, my city isn’t the largest in missouri and it’s absolutely pitiful. I was just feeling bitter and pessimistic.
People from Mississippi, how likely do think it is that a democrat holds office in your lovely state?
"'Brandon Presley and D.C. Democrats are dreaming if they think they can turn Mississippi blue. The hard-working people of Mississippi know they can’t afford a Joe Biden liberal running the state into the ground,' Sara Craig, executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said in a statement.".
This is true. It has the highest percentage of Black folk compared to every other state. They just have to be activated and galvanized.
The trickier part is to get the white vote from the teens to the twenties to at least be competitive.
This take is freezing. The state of the Democratic Party is impressively strong. They’ve won or overperformed in 3 straight cycles by successfully building a durable, anti-maga coalition.
