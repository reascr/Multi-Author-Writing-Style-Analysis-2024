Edit: For clarity I’m saying as far as I’m aware, Australia doesn’t hand out titles, awards or medals to visiting dignitaries like Presidents or Prime Ministers.
Our awards like the Order of Australia aren’t decided by Charles. And even the example of former Japanese president, was awarded the Order last year after they stopped being president.
Dipping Maccas chips into soft serve is weird to some, normal to others. You can have something be weird and not weird to different people.
Honestly, I'd argue everyone else are the weird ones lol. Like honestly, why would anyone give a shit about a medal they didn't actually earn? It's like getting a participation trophy, it's meaningless unless you did something to earn it.
so, the medal is worthless... i wonder how the people who actually merited it for a reason feel about this.
So that makes it basically worthless to get the “honor” and the medal then it seems. Yesterday I saw articles about Zelensky getting “France’s Top Honor established by Napoleon yada yada” when basically it’s like a friendship badge.
