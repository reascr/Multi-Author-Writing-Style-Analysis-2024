They're also incredibly advantageous to Poland. Despite what some folks around these parts might want to believe, Poland is the next stop for Russia, if Putin is able to somehow take Ukraine. Putin wants to test Article 5 and the resolve of NATO's members, because he has more to gain if his gamble is correct than he would stand to lose if he was wrong. Poland giving aid to Ukraine helps to prevent that eventuality from ever happening at all, down the line.
No one was criticizing the amount of aid poland sent to Ukraine. He was saying that the constant attack on Germany and basically lying about certain issues (leo request etc.) is a election tactic by polish politicians who are about to hold a election.
This is why a lot of people call what poland is doing political posturing. Because they are basically lying about the facts to create the narrative that Germany is still doing fuck all because they are about to face elections in Poland and thats a popular position to hold in poland.
The only thing Poland is super eager for is to garner votes for their upcoming election they donâ€™t give a shit about Ukraine they just want to make Germany a boogeyman to anger the voting base.
Frankly, this has nothing to do with Ukraine or Polish aid to Ukraine and everything to do with Polish politics.
If they take Ukraine, they'll see much more... enthusiastic allied participation from their friends -- Iran, Afghanistan, North Korea, Belarus. They're not individually powerful by any means, but the common thread between them is deep experience with geurilla warfare and fomenting radical insurgencies... which happen to be the tools that are most useful to Russia right now for disrupting the West.
