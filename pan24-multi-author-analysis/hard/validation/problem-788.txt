they were getting away with occupying Crimea for 8 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't gotten greedy.
without the war Ukraine might have had a small chance of recovering Crimea at the eventual death of Putin, if it had led to enough turmoil within Russia, but that's about it.
Combine that with Russia's borderline suicidal aggressiveness elsewhere, and it starts to look like there isn't going to be much left to defend Crimea by the time Ukraine gets there.
I mean, I have no doubts Ukraine is going to liberate Melitopol eventually but I expect the Russian army to throw everything it can to prevent it.
When the war is over, I want Ukraine rebuilt to better than it ever was just to show Russians what they are missing by supporting Putin's cleptocracy.
I think Iran, North Korea and Cuba are good examples of countries limping along under heavy sanctions or blockades. All three very different countries and they have sought different ways to adapt, but also all "functioning".
The remaining value of sanctions is to make it as hard as possible for Russia to build weapons, and to isolate them from any remaining suppliers of weapons.
It was seen going to St. Petersburg a couple of months ago, to new moorings built there, so I doubt it will go to his Black Sea palace any time soon. Will leave a link to the source in a comment.
