However (1) any training force is probably being trained just as competently as the original invasion force, at best; and (2) the Russians likely don't have supplies for those forces even if they've stripped the Belarusian Army to the studs.
They had 190,000 go in. They mobilized another 300,000 and brought another 50,000 - 100,000 from other regions.
There is no big additional mobilisation in Ukraine, as i know, because if its really 100k killed, you need to have at least 300k wounded.
In other way, with 100k killed, Russia spent their main troops, called the first mobilisation, and thinking about the second.
I keep seeing the 100'000 deaths figure but do we have an idea what Russia's total casualties might be (i.e deaths, wounded, mia). I also wonder how many POWs Ukraine has taken.
I would guess that the ukranian numbers contain quite a lot of heavily wounded. Its not like ukraine can distinguish between someone dead or lying screaming in a ditch with 2 extremities less in a square grit 30km away from the next ukrainian position.
