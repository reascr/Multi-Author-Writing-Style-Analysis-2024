Banned stuff has to be transported. Transport vessels are very expensive. Insurance companies will refuse to insure said ship if they're carrying banned goods. Transit areas like straits (e.g., Bosphorus) will refuse access to ships which aren't insured because ships can damage the strait or get stuck and require millions to extract (e.g., Evergreen in the Suez Canal).
So if a ship is carrying Russian oil to a country that's paying more than $60/bbl for it, then that ship is effectively uninsured and can only travel in the open ocean directly to/from Russia. That basically limits Russian exports to the Pacific Ocean where it, presumably, doesn't have a ton of oil infrastructure.
In summary, if a ship transports Russian oil at a price over 60$, it won't get insurance to cross the Straits like Suez Canal. Then this ship will only able to take the Open Waters meaning it delay it's transport tremendously (going around Africa to go to India). Since part of the money is only transferred once the goods are delivered, the remaining 50-70% of the sum will come late while Russia needs as much money as possible right now.
Countries are not friends, they don't help each others out without gaining something in return. If you take India, they have no incentive to pay Russia an extra 20$ because they know Russia HAS TO sell its Gaz. And if Russia doesn't want to sell for 60$ and the ship has to take the route around Africa to reach India, the delivery will take a lot more time which means Russia will gets the money later (probably 50% at delivery) and they can't afford that.
So what is in place from countries being like, "we will pay $60 per barrel" so that they stay insured and can transport it or whatever, and then, they turn around and pay Russia and extra $20 after the oil has already been shipped and delivered?
They absolutely will bother to do it. Look at Wall Streets history of corruption and fraud, and the governments history of corruption and fraud in regards to "war/defense" in the US and the energy markets.
Just because the general population might "think" countries are only paying Russia $60, doesn't actually mean they aren't paying $80. The elite are corrupt as fuck.
