Keep in mind, the bill didn't pass by a vote of 62-37, it only advances to be voted on at this point by that margin.
Obviously it now only needs 50 senators to approve it to pass, but it'll be interesting to see if anyone who voted for a vote on it will now vote against it (or vice-versa).
Overcoming the filibuster to start debate on the bill is what requires 60 votes, which is the vote that this article is talking about. The subsequent vote after debate is closed that decides whether the bill passes or not only requires a simple majority of 50+1.
If you pass something through budget reconciliation, that only takes a simple majority, but that only refers to spending.
However one of the Senate's rules is that a few spending bills ("budget reconciliation") cannot be filibustered. They can only do this a few times per year, and these bills can only have certain types of provisions. For example, it's not possible to do a marriage bill under budget reconciliation because it has nothing to do with taxing/spending.
1. Someone tried to filibuster to prevent the bill from being voted on. No surprise there, nearly every bill gets filibustered.
However, not all Democrats want to get rid of the filibuster. Most famously Manchin and Sinema are against getting rid of it, but the truth is there are even more Dems who also want to keep it in place. It's not going away anytime soon.
