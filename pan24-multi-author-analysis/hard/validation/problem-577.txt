SCOTUS justices should never be allowed to receive gifts from people or groups that have a vested interest in their rulings, regardless of whether the justices disclose it. Although federal employees are not justices, federal employees are not allowed to receive any gifts from people or groups that could affect their decisions regarding federal contracts. There is no reason that this rule should not also apply to SCOTUS justices, and the potential impact of any biased rulings can be far more consequential.
Superior appellate judges, who can decide to use ethics lapses as grounds to overturn improper actions by a judge under their purview (and which do not exist over the Supreme Court), and.
Near the end of the article, “The court’s response simply restated which ethics laws apply to the court and that court’s court’s code of conduct, which is non-binding and unenforced, exists.”.
The Code of Conduct for United States Judges (those ethics standards you're referring to) is merely advisory. It has no enforcement mechanism, and is not binding to be used as the basis for civil or criminal action; so at the end of the day the fact that it doesn't apply to Supreme Court justices is entirely meaningless. It's basically just a worthless piece of paper even for the judges it does apply to.
