States with stricter gun regulation see lower gun crime. Waiting periods for instance are shown to dramatically decrease gun violence.
“Mental health” is the tiredest most hollow refrain from the pro-gun lobby (whose goal is to sell as many guns and gun accessories as possible all the time).
the vast majority of mass shooters are not experiencing a mental health crisis, this is a red herring used by the right to dismiss gun violence. just like they dismiss the suicides by gun as well. since you can't compel someone to seek treatment perhaps making it way harder to get firearms would be helpful. all i know is i have a right not to be murdered while going to the store and that should outweigh someones right to carry a firearm in public.
i live in a place where i have more places to buy guns near my house that i have to buy food. guns are insanely easy to get and that's exactly the problem. the rate of gun violence in this country mostly tracks the increased numbers of guns in US households.
