"Fiscally conservative" is just code for "I'm a nasty bigot but don't like having to argue about it".
Laughing my entire ass off at the "fiscal conservatives" replying to this comment like I give a fuck what their smoothbrain has to say ðŸ˜‚.
The House Republicans and their conservative Wing are going to act like a monkey throwing shit at the wall for the next two years. They are going to pass bill after Bill that will take a spin through the Fox News cycle and then take a Second Spin through the news cycle when they die in the senate.
Then when the bill dies in the Senate Fox News will spend some time talking about how obviously the Democrats want to let IRS SWAT teams raid people's houses. If the Democrats are smart they will adopt Mitch McConnell's strategy of Simply never taking votes on these bills.
The people backing the Republican party no full well that none of these bills will ever pass. They don't care.
They don't care who or what gets hurt or damaged... The accumulation of power, wealth and status will continue.
For the wealthy and Powerful the status quo is almost always the most profitable situation. When the system changes you have to spend new money and jockey with other people to try to get your position settled in the new system.
