Isn't that how it is done? If I understand correctly, (and I very well may not, but would be happy to learn more if someone would like to correct me).
Keep on repeating until you get the purity you need. So it makes sense they would enrich, enriched uranium. i.e. they are just working towards a higher level of purity, but each step I suppose it technically enriched.
3-spin up that 5% mixture to seperate out purer uranium - let's suppose you now have a 40% pure sample.
The remainder U-238 from the process is often called "depleted uranium" since it far less U-235, and as a result, is a lot less radioactive.
The depleted U238 (remember if you started out with 1 ton of uranium, you'd end up with just 7.5 kg of pure u235., so getti g considerable amounts of u235 requires tons and tons of U238. The U238 can be used for different things. You can convert it to Pu239 in breeder reactors, or as depleted uranium it can be used at tank armor and tank rounds ( though even the US is endnming DU tank rounds out of preference for ithe rmaterials and for environmental reasons. It could be used as nuclear shielding and be quite good in certain applications , as it's denser than lead, but people don't like to use it as such.
