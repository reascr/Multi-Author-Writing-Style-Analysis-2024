Not to burst your bubble, but there are already studies on this ðŸ˜… According to the studies, happiness does increase with more money, BUT only up to about $70k-$100k per year in the developed world (depends on the country). When you have money to save, invest, vacation, and to meet all your needs with ease like food, Healthcare, shelter, etc. happiness increases dramatically. Beyond that, it is just the addition of zeros. Conclusion: Money doesn't buy happiness, but being poor causes misery ðŸ˜•.
These "leaders" see increases year after year with out fail they get bonuses that would be life changing for regular people and yet money doesn't buy happiness.
IMO after financial security there are some pretty harsh diminishing returns on the happiness additional money on its own will bring. However, money can enable you to pursue other interests that might make you much happier, if you have such interests in the first place.
Just as a silly one-off example, when I finally bought a nice electric guitar after playing the same Squier Strat for half my life it absolutely breathed new life into that hobby. That's a (relatively) cheap one but I could see there being more expensive examples if you like to climb mountains around the world or something.
