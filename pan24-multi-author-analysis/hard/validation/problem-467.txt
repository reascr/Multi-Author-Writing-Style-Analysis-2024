"Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush stood alongside the DeSantis clan for the oath of office, and he clapped.".
Cmon. Noone does that. Or noone worth caring about. There are a multitude of daft voices out there that we don't have to listen to.
'Woke' means, 'something DeSantis disagrees with'. It can stretch and morph to include anything DeSantis or other right wing politicians want to to demonise. Needless to say, its creeping fascism.
DeSantis is just a symptom of creeping fascism, this is something that has been decades in the making. It didn't start with Trump. It goes way way back.
I do appreciate this dive you did, and I feel that what Stanford said is after-the-fact damage control spin. If you're a US citizen, you're automatically American because that's the name of the country and thus an interchangeable term. If they were truly concerned about Canadian and Mexican representation when describing residents of the continent, then just say "North Americans" because that's the name of the continent. I read it originally as saying not to use American because it might hurt the feelings of people who are present without paperwork to be so, or have paperwork but aren't citizens. North American would also include the undocumented and H1-B visa holders. Visa holders aren't Americans or US citizens, even if they live there for years as they are expected to return. They are temporary residents as are tourists.
