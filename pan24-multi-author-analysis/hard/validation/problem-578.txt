I donâ€™t think she was always a Republican in D clothing. Keith Olbermann - whose podcast I follow - has talked about her several times, how close they were, and during that time, he describes her as rather farther left than him. This would have been through at least fall of 2010 - it was her outreach on behalf of 2 AZ Representatives who needed help paying for security after death threats that got him suspended from MSNBC.
So she was likely still actually liberal as of 10 years ago, as she voted pretty hard left in the House, probably getting bought out in the run-up to her running for Senate in 2018.
So, since this proves that anyone can get elected as a Republican, regardless of background, what's to stop someone on the far left from running as a Republican and then siding with Democrats on all issues after getting in?
It's frustrating that Dems will run a candidate based on seniority instead of ability to win. I hope someone serious primaries him but not holding my breath.
I get that people don't like Sinema, but they'll miss her when they get Lake. Basically the MTG of AZ.
It's too bad bc the next AZ senate race will be Ruban Giallego (who got his ass handed to him when he ran for governor 2 years ago) vs Kari lake (super MAGA). Ruban called for open borders. You can't say stuff like that and win a general election in Arizona. He might have learned that while running for gov, but it's all on tape. Independents don't like him and they decide the election.
