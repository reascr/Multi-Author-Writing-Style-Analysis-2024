Just a hypothetical here, let's say Ghana needs to buy one barrel of oil (currently around $80). They need to convert their own currency to USD first in order to buy that barrel. Currently, it takes 14.41 Ghanian Cedi (their currency) in order to get 1 USD. Maybe that doesn't sound like a lot, but at the beginning of the year it was around 6 Cedi = 1 USD. A HUGE difference. A single USD is now 135% more valuable compared to the Cedi than it was on January 1.
You've probably seen in the news lately that the US Federal Reserve is raising rates in order to combat inflation in the United States. (The Federal Reserve is the central banking system in the US.).
So, yeah. Maybe u should convince the world that weaponizing the dollar and printing paper currency based in faith is still the best option.
U guys who still have faith are always saying that this faith backed currency ia great and the best option. Yet the reserve currency in USD keeps falling meeting the natural and historic trend of empires rise and fall. Right now at 59%. Once u hit that 40%, it might happen till 2030, things wont be too well internally for the US.
