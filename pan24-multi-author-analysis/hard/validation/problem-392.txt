People are the problem here. People are seeing and interpreting the polls the aggregators with their own built in bias and are missing what is actually out there.
More importantly, though, most polling is in no way inaccurate. There are polling organizations that are better than others, but inaccurate polling is usually a choice.
I'm aware there are more partisan leaning polls now than in the past (at least in part because the way we generate random samples has become more subjective and that introduces a new opportunity to introduce bias).
So Dems were getting good internal polling; established pollsters were pretty much on the money; but there were simply so many outfits doing shitty, Republican-favorable polling that it actually badly skewed the overall perception of the race.
When you combine that with two successive elections where the Rs outperformed the polls, leading to a persistent belief that R voters were underrepresented, you had media figures working off averages skewed by bad data that then put their fingers on the scale to further shift the polling right.
