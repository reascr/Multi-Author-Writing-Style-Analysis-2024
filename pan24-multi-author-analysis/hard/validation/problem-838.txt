A company in an instance like this should have no legal protections from being obligated to fulfil their word as though it were a binding contract; the employees and executives should have no fiduciary duty to lie to the general public in any case, even if this is damaging to the company's income; and such representatives of the company should have no legal protections against lawsuits if they do lie.
Unfortunately, the world we live in is one where a company is expected and required to lie to the general public if this is in any way advantageous to the shareholders of the company, and even outright breaking the law is required of executives if doing so will increase corporate profits.
since our legal system is insufficient to require or even promote good behavior on behalf of corporations, it falls to private citizens to punish them for their moral failures.
You need a moral majority (preferably with an empowered government) to constrain capitalist organizations to moral standards, by making it artificially more expensive to be immoral than moral. Unicorns are slightly more effective at this, however, due to their existence being somewhat less implausible than the former.
Yup. Capitalism is neither inherently moral nor immoral; it is amoral, and its only real tenet is "more money is better".
It IS immoral, to anyone who cares about society. Capitalism doesn't give a flyin' anything about society, though. In capitalism, even if the world is descending into destruction, as long as you have the most money, you're winning (and getting more money means more winning).
