Baldwin has won fairly comfortably in her re-election bids but I don't think she's yet said if she'll run for another term. Tester OTOH is in real trouble as MT has lurched far to the right and AZ looks dicey if Sinema runs as an independent (even if she does poorly the elections in that state are so close it won't take much for it to flip to R.) Even if Dems somehow maintain their razor thin majority SCOTUS reform still won't happen. (If they lose control and a SCOTUS seat somehow opens then Democrats won't even be able to fill it if R's hold a majority.).
Good. Don't punish people who are merely accused of crime. If you want to take guns away from domestic abusers then take the time to prove them guilty in a court of law.
This ruling does not cover convicted abusers. It’s almost as if the standard necessary to procure a restraining order is insufficient to strip a citizen of their inherent rights, and a surprising number of people are offended by this concept.
lol yeah the Taliban were super big on that whole “innocent until proven guilty” schtick that is at the basis of this ruling. That’s an impressive hot take.
That's cool. All this proves is that the ENTIRE constitution is up to the interpretation of the political whims of whatever judges and justices occupy the courts. Be careful what you wish for conservatives.
The "accused" had taken part in several shootings while he was under the restraining order. You gun humping psycopaths will make any excuse to defend your precious "inanimate objects".
