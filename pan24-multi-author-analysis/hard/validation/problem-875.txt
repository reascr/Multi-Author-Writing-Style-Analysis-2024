ok, and, as the article mentions, the vast majority of independents vote for one party overwhelmingly.
Absolutely, ranked choice voting would give the independents a lot of power and pull politics back to the center instead of a choice between two extremes.
Voting for a third party is basically making sure that at best your vote just doesn't matter and at worse not having voted for your preferred candidate from the Democrats and the GOP means the worst candidate from your perspective wins.
Change the voting system so it doesn't punish third-party voting and you'll see a lot more people vote for third-party candidates.
Except it wasn't too long ago the Dem party said it didn't matter if they were biased, because they don't even have to abide by primary results.
The point is the DNC said in court they can be biased because the results of the primary don't even need followed.
The court threw out the lawsuit about bias because the DNC argued that bias isnt illegal, because the results of a primary aren't legally binding.
In the primary the DNC has argued in court that votes don't matter, and they're legally allowed to put whoever they want up in the general.
Their legal defense against bias was it doesn't matter because they can run anyone they want in the general.
Their argument was it doesn't matter if the party is biased during primaries, because primaries don't really matter. They can run anyone in the general they want regardless.
