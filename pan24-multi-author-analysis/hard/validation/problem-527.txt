DeSantis is a completely different caliber from all of them. He is relatively young, but not as inexperienced as Rubio. He is charismatic, though not as batshit insane as Cruz, he is liked by the establishment, though not as dead boring as Kasich or Bush.
Bush was unenthusiastic as fuck and in a year where people had enough of political dynasties he was doa.
It DeSantis is smart (and while he's cruel and petty, I'm not convinced he's dumb), he'll sit 2024 out, let Trump implode, and instead keep his eyes on 2028.
By Suffer the consequences, I hope he means by Him running as an Independent in 2024 when he loses the Republican primary to Desantis.
The worst case scenario for the RNC if they do somehow wind up with a Trump/DeSantis ticket is DeSantis taking over early enough into Trump's first term that he's only able to run for re-election once.
I'm not saying don't take the threat of a 2nd Trump term seriously, but him getting through the primaries is going to be significantly more troublesome than last time.
