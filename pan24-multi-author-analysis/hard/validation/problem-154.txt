In conjencture with assisted suicide laws, this should greatly reduce Canada's mental health budget. Feeling sad? Take some drugs. Stuck in a downward spiral of drug use? Kill yourself.
Pretty much any functional state outside North America. Even Latin American countries that produce hard drugs, have use under contol better than Canada and the US.
I don't know, plenty of countries have successful strict drug laws. Drugs just seem to be part of North American culture. A lot of popular NA music is about drugs, they find kids hopped up on drugs after a vist to the dentist to be funny, etc. It's not enough to have intermittent efforts to stump out drug use, which is what you're referring to, there needs to be a sustained effort, which politicians and law enforcement are not capable of carrying because they don't see drug use as a big deal, because it's part of the culture.
I can't speak for this decriminalization measure, but typically they're aimed to provide more care for drug users, ensuring what they're doing is safe and clean, and that there are resources for those that have issues with drugs.
Even if it's not as effective as promised, pretty much anything at this point is better than the sick societal self harm that is drug prohibition.
The data isn't fully conclusive that decriminalization makes everything better, but it is conclusive that the war on drugs does more harm than good.
Studies show decriminalisation along with offering treatment to be the most effective way to deal with drug problems. Posturing about being tough on drugs has been a complete waste of money and police time for nothing more than a virtue signal.
