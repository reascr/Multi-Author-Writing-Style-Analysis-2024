This bill doesn't require churches or people of faith to participate in any way, shape, or form of a same sex marriage. A same sex couple getting married has ZERO effect on these people's lives. This all about forcing their religion on the rest of the populace. Therefore why are people of faith in need of protection? Absolutely illogical and insane.
Edit: This shit just makes my blood boil. I cant stand the mental gymnastics that goes on in the heads of people on the right. They think that if other people don't conform to their religion's ideology that somehow their religious freedom is being infringed. Un-fucking-real.
“I’ll tell you my priority,” Hartzler said. “Protect religious liberty, protect people of faith, and protect Americans who believe in the true meaning of marriage!”.
I'm still looking for the connection between same sex marriage rights and a threat to religious freedom.
In her case I think she might genuinely be afraid of the consequences of letting gay people get married. She's lived in terror of a vengeful God all her life. She probably things the USA will quite literally get sucked into hell if she allows gay marriage.
