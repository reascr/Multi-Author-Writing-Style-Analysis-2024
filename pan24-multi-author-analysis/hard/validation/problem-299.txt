There's also a big sampling bias. The idea that "Police-submitted request to the ATF" is a direct corollary to the rate at which ghost guns are used in crimes is a rather large leap. It's as much about whether police bother submitting the trace to the ATF as it is their actual use.
There is an implication in the media that "ghost guns" are always 3D-printed or CNC'ed home-built guns. However, my understanding is that they are simply any gun without a serial number, including normally manufactured guns that had the serial number filed off.
Is this the same federal report that lumps guns with defaced serial numbers in with guns that were never serialized?
I have not heard the term being applied to regular guns with filed/altered serial numbers. Ghost guns don't have a serial number, but it doesn't seem to apply to guns which had their serial number removed (that may change if we allow serial numbers to be removed). Where are you seeing that these are included in ghost gun statistics?
Ghost guns ARE useful however in one area- all gun shops are required to keep sales records for life. If some racist redneck militia (or a staff member working at a gun shop of one) gets their hands on that, they have a pretty good idea of who has guns in an area. When that record doesn’t exist locally, such as with a “ghost” gun, that’s one less gun that an unlawful militia can find out about in case they actually decide to try and start a civil war.
