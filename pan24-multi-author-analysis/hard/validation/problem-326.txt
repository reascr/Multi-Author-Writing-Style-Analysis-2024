COVID vaccines do wear out over time, but even then, their main purpose is to make getting sick much less lethal.
Also, over 95% of the population is vaccinated so many of those who catch COVID generally have less severe symptoms. When I got it I just had a slight headache and a runny nose.
I'm sure if it was worse we'd still be living under various health restrictions. Yet, they've just about all been lifted. Even healthcare and childcare workers can work without masks these days and it's no longer a requirement to isolate if you have a positive test. So we either don't care anymore or it's not bad enough to warrant the many health restrictions that were once implemented to control the spread of the disease.
Last I heard it was Omicron. A quick google search suggests that XBB is a subvariant of Omicron. Omicron is statistically far less severe than the Delta strain and I recall reading a study that suggests its no worse than the common flu in terms of symptoms and the only thing it really has over the flu is that it spreads far more easily which, inevitably, results in far more people actually getting sick.
We stopped caring. The current strain seems to be no worse than the common flu. It's not even a requirement to isolate if you're COVID positive now.
