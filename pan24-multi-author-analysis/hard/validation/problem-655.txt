The problem is, this GOP clown show is sucking all the attention away from serious issues. Take the current healthcare collapse, for example (I‚Äôm an ER nurse). While McCarthy, Santos, MTG and the other crazies scream at the Dems and plot their revenge, the country is going to shit. Where is the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù Republican healthcare plan they promised OVER TEN YEARS AGO? And from this shit show we‚Äôve seen in their first month, I don‚Äôt expect this Republican majority House to get any work done for the next 2 years. Everyone please take care of yourself, the wait for care in the ER gets longer every day.
Yes, their malfeasance/criminality absolutely should be exposed in the media. But despite him being out of office for 2 years, Trump‚Äôs MAGA cult of personality continues to dominate the news‚Äîon both conservative and liberal outlets. It‚Äôs like a reality freak show that even MSNBC can‚Äôt resist. I‚Äôve had to go on a news fast ever since the marathon McCarthy circus. I also quit twitter after that megalomaniac Musk took over. And now he‚Äôs brining back Trump, ffs! It‚Äôs like being trapped in an episode of Black Mirror on a loop. I‚Äôm depending on you fine people at reddit to post breaking news if and when any of them are indicted. ü§Ø.
Since the (compromised by Republicans) ACA was passed in 2010, the Democrats have spent most of the intervening years defending against further cuts to healthcare by Republicans. Wins for Democrats have been small, but significant: Such as drug pricing reform, supporting State Medicaid Expansion, and providing billions in pandemic relief. (The later vitally important considering Trump spent the critical first year of the pandemic denying COVID was even a serious health threat.).
2. Santos at this point is starting to show something that might be as bad as an total health care collapse, if not worse. Which might be a lot broader then just Santos, namely how much the GOP and perhaps even America democracy in total has been infiltrated by foreign money.
And as it turns out that the FBI counter intelligence was bought by the Russians, and his girlfriend was staying with Giuliani. Showing that the Russians might have been more influential then known so far in 2016 .
