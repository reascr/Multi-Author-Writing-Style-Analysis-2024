Well, he doesnâ€™t have a website keeping track of all the time he spends golfing so he has exceed my expectations. Will be interesting how he handles this train spill as opposed to the last one with the same chemicals.
Also, the spill is handled by EPA, local authorities, etc. DoTs job is to investigate the derailment to determine if there was a breach of regulations, and then apply whatever penalties are legally available. I think the cap on fines is around 200k, unfortunately.
The investigation has to conclude before fines can be issued, due process and all that. Fines are also capped by law, which congress would have to change.
Deliberately missing the point, I see. Ohio seems to think it can handle it on its own. The relevant DotT and EPA people were on site within hours, but no the exec branch can't invade a state just because it wants to respond to a crisis.
I realize the exec branch can't "invade" just because they want to respond in a crisis. That's why governors have to declare an emergency and call for help from FEMA when there's a flood or forest fire.
