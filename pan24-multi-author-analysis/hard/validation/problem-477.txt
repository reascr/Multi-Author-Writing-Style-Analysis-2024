Why is it absurd? Inconvenient or unusual I get but, absurd? Presidency is a team job - as long as the person surrounds themselves with the right people and has the character/wisdom to listen to their advice, why does it matter? Presidents have always been limited in their knowledge and have always depended on an army of experts and staff, Biden has had great success so far and someone half his age might not have been able to duplicate that.
He has the charisma of a barrel, DeSantis on the national stage is going to be a tough sell. People are hoping it’ll be him because there’s just nobody else - him and Trump are the biggest names and Trump is a general election loser so Republicans are hoping against hope that DeSantis will step up.
RNC won’t do a thing. First off, there is a serious chasm between the RNC and the primary voters and second, to eliminate Trump the candidates would have to Voltron behind someone else and none of them are humble enough to do it. That’s how Trump eeked by the first time around, too.
It will be a mistake to put too much focus on Trump over the next couple years. Trump is a proven loser, he will never win another election unless there is a military coup to put him there. DeSantis is the only other proven commodity in the GOP. He’s staying in the background because a) he’s a coward and b) he knows he has to wait for Trump’s legal trouble / self-implosion to play out before he makes a real move or Trump’s base may turn against him. When everything shakes out it will be DeSantis as the nominee and yelling about Trump on the internet will have been a waste of time. Focus on the future.
