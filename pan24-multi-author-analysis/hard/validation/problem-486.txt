They know the shit they propose isn't going to pass, it's all optics like most Republican bullshit. I doubt after the abortion fiasco they actually want to pass anything but they will put forward all sorts of bills for propaganda purposes and blame Biden for not passing them. All they care about is obstructing government and blocking tax reform, it's what they were paid off to do.
Honestly, even if the GOP controlled all branches of government and both levels of congress I would want them to pay our bills. This is so stupid how politics has become a sport with moronic voters trying to rack up points for doing the opposite of what the other side wants.
And like last time they won't talk about that and all the little idiots who argue that all politicians are equal will proceed to pretend like the preening and posturing is equal and without consequences.
Well, the Americans got downgraded last time they did this, making the loans they depend on more expensive. Hurtig all programs and plans, especially infrastructure, health, education.
