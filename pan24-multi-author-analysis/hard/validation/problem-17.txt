“Our planet is in crisis,” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, said in a press conference earlier this month. More than a million species are threatened with extinction, she said, and populations of most major animal groups have declined by an average of 69 percent. “Clearly, the world is crying out for change,” she said.'.
Ehh. 20 years ago we had 1 year to change or we will all peril or wish we did. We didn't change so I expect it is all over no matter what...unless the science changed and this climate thing is less severe than thought?
Thank God but how do we know they're right this time? I think we are not supposed to question it, but if no one ever questions it, how do we know when we're wrong like we have been in the past?
I'm also open to the idea I'm wrong! I listed some of the horrible, scary predictions. What's the scariest prediction that has actually come true?
What is the scariest prediction that came true? There have been years of threats that are designed to make it sound like ahumanity is at risk and all of our lives will be drastically different by now . Look at old articles.from 20 years ago. Scary but it has all been noise. I'm thinking about no polar ice, increased severe hurricanes in the US, mass flooding if Florida ( remember the map that showed Florida almost completely underwater by now) or the like.
