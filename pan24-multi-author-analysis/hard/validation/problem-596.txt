So… blaming the Jews for everything is fine (and gets you a Republican “free speech” endorsement??) but saying you like Hitler is too far? Do I have all of this in the right order?
I guess what I was trying to highlight was Republicans saying “we didn’t care about this guy before but now we stand by his right to say Jews are running a global conspiracy and ruining his life” and then backtracking when he went from 99% to 100% on the antisemitism.
I'm saying for the time being, right wing figures like Tucker Carlson prefer to engage in dog whistles where they can feign ignorance about their bigotry if confronted, as opposed to just saying "I hate Jews" or yelling the N word. Tucker Carlson took the interview with Kanye and edited out the stuff where he thought Kanye went too far, or said things that wouldn't support Carlson's narrative, and used that cut down version to push his own views, rather than just presenting Kanye as he really is.
Yep. Tucker Carlson even out the most egregious antisemitism from his two hour interview with Kanye in October (along with other crazy statements, and even Kanye just saying he was vaccinated) to make him more palatable to his right wing audience. The people on the right know full well how crazy and offensive he is, but they see him as a fig leaf to hide their racism behind simply because he's Black. It's the same thing they're doing with Herschel Walker.
Yep. People need to remember that Hitler was inspired by American treatment of Black people and Jim Crow laws as a blueprint for what he did with respect to Jews in Europe before the Holocaust truly began in the 1940s.
Check out the applause that Dave Chappelle was getting on SNL last month for his to Kanye and Kyrie on how to "properly" engage in antisemitism. It's extremely mainstream nowadays.
Of course it's going mainstream. Antisemitism is never far behind fascism, although the fascists try to make it all a bit milder and more milquetoast... at first.
It is mainstream with Conservatives who are after all Christian white nationalist scum and fascists. So yes. Hate is on the rise in conservative America and the violent attacks against us will continue.
