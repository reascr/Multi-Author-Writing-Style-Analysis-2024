Actually it had very important military consequences. Before that raid Japanese army was opposed to navy plan of taking Midway, considering it too risky and poorly planned. But after raid army felt humiliated and agreed to follow that plan to restore its honour. And we know how it ended.
The problem is that you cannot destroy those sites instantly, and as soon as mass missile launch is detected, all nukes will fly from their silos. If USA could destroy nuclear arsenal of its main enemy with zero consequences, it would have done so a long time ago.
There aren't anywhere near as many sub nukes as other nukes, so if you could take out most ground nukes you'd still wipe out most of their nukes.
Well,... unfortunately it doesn't take all the nukes to do irreversible damage. Imagine that just 2 missiles get through. One for Europe one for the East Coast of the US. I can't remember if it were six or eight warheads per missile, but ultimately if the 8 largest cities per destination are destroyed, the economy, political landscape and quite frankly the environment, would be irreversible destroyed.
