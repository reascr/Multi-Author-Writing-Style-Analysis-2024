Yeah, and that’s too bad for the energy companies, but they have to take the L - their prediction models failed, so why are we paying for that? If they bought a shitload of gas at X price, and it’s now X -60%, then they should take that hit and absorb the cost through the massive profits they’ve been scooping up for years.
It may seem disingenuous to buy gas when it’s expensive, but if you don’t, then the level of panic about your low gas reserves pushes up the gas price, so you’ll pay even more tomorrow.
The reason that the gas prices are coming down now is precisely because our gas storage is relatively full right now. Hadn’t we filled it with expensive gas in the past months, then today’s gas prices wouldn’t be coming down.
What the price trends will look like will also depend on our gas consumption levels in the coming month or so. If consumption stays as low as it it today I’d expect consumer prices to fall rapidly. If consumption picks up and gas storage levels start declining, prices may stay higher for a bit longer.
Gas storages are currently actually filling up rather than depleting due to low gas consumption for the time of the year.
It’s likely that even a year from now, some % of the gas storage still expensive gas bought last autumn. The lower this % becomes, the lower prices will become.
Let's not pretend that they're trying to lower prices as quickly as possible or at all. If competition doesn't force them to drop prices back down they will simply keep them.
It'll take about 10 years for competition to pull prices back down. Despite being a few servers and a call centre, supply companies are really difficult to get running due to the regulation and loads of the smaller ones collapsed (even if for their number of customers they had by far the most already bought off the market so should've been far more buoyant but they couldn't reach the sheer scale of credit that they needed, even though they were already the most expensive for that reason and had the wealthiest customers who always pay).
