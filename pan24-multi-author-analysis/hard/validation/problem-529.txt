Most Americans have never left the USA. They have little clue about foreign societies. They also think that America is superior to everywhere else. This is a big part of why American leads the world in gun violence.
Yep, and you just got a slew of down votes for stating the blindingly obvious: There is absolutely no fucking way that America could transition to a zero gun society overnight.
Yes, clearly "ban all guns" would solve this from ever happening again, but there is no way to actually get there, so it's a non-starter of a discussion.
Edit: Since some people have this going over their head, it's important to realize that when I say the gun wasn't the problem, I don't mean that if it didn't exist it wouldn't have happened. That's obviously true. The point I'm making is that there's 10 other things that went wrong that caused this to happen.
You're putting it as "No gun = nobody gets shot" vs me, taking it as "No parents = child brought a gun to school.".
True. Of course there is a bit of chicken and egg there in that the sorts of people most likely to be shot are also the sorts of people most likely to own a gun. But even with all that you're more likely to be shot by a toddler than you are to shoot a criminal with your gun.
