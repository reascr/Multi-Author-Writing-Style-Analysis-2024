I mean even in NYC, Republicans at the state level fuck things up. NYC has wanted to drastically expand its school zone speed camera program for years, but Republicans in Albany put a stop to it every time.
Conservatives don't even acknowledge that they're homophobic. My dad used to say things like "look at that queer, I wish I had an excuse to punch him" to my brother and I as kids if we passed someone who "looked gay" in the street. Despite this, he will to this day deny that he is or ever was a bigot. "Live and let live, that's my motto," he'll say, adding: "just as long as they don't ram it down our throats." When you ask him to clarify what "ramming it down our throats" means, he'll say "you know, holding hands and kissing in public, that sort of thing.".
Woah. Dehumanizing people and telling your followers that they’re ruining your country leads to unfavorable actions against those people? Honestly I’m amazed. I never thought words could lead to violence. It’s never happened before. Not in WWI, or WWII, or the civil rights movement, or truly any event in history.
