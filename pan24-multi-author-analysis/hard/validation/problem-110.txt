Graduate students aren't herded into a room and basically lied to that their degrees will make paying back loans simple, the way freshmen are (with little to no explanation of the impact of compounding interest), so it's understandable and I hope it works out.
10% is the current level for IBR. What will make a difference for graduate students is the planned increase the threshold of what counts as discretionary income. If that works out, it will lower graduate payments simply because the 10% threshold will be based on a smaller amount of their income.
Side A: We should make it easier to go to college and lower the burden of paying back loans that many people can't afford.
If all you can afford to pay on your loan is $0 a month, maybe you should have considered a different career track or whether you should have the school you did in the first place.
Endowments aren't built from tuition rates or collected from students; they're funded by donors. But schools should be tapping into them more to help address the rising costs of education.
It did, but the implementation is hung up in court. So it looks like the admin is trying to split the program and implement the IBRP changes separately.
