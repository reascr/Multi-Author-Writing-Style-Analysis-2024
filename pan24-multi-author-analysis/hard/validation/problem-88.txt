>“Let me tell you something,” Wilson said. “Donald Trump would rather Joe Biden be president for a thousand years than Ron DeSantis be president for five minutes.”.
DeSantis doesn't have Trump's charm, he doesn't have Trump's money, and it remains to be seen whether he has Trump's sociopathic viciousness. Popularity isn't enough. Governing isn't enough. Ideas and policies aren't enough. These guys are in a pissing contest. MAGA voters care about dominance. Who is the Alpha MAGA? We've seen Trump neuter opponents before. Does DeSantis have it in him to take down Trump?
Good point. If the right wing media start to criticise Trump for his lies and divisiveness and self obsession, rather than justify or even lionise, the dynamic would definitely be different.
Part of Trump's power has been the media's tendency to frame everything in terms of "why are Republicans angry today?" When he's the only game in town , even left leaning media is obsessed with him to the exclusion of everything else. But that dynamic isn't a Trump thing, it's a Newt Gingrich thing. Right wing media power is drifting away from Trump, and mainstream to left leaning media has already signaled a shift to DeSantis as soon as he comes out of the Fox News bubble.
