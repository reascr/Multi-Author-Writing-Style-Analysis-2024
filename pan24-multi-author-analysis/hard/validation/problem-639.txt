They haven't been at war for a very long time, that much is for sure. The last time was in 1979 and even that was just 3 weeks of war that was mostly just meant to demonstrate that the Soviet Union would not help Vietnam.
Holy economics101 Batman. First off, the US is extremely prosperous right now. The rich-poor split is by design, not by accident. Secondly, you don't get to a higher level of prosperity by bringing back jobs that add less value. To increase prosperity, you need to add jobs that add more value than the average job does currently.
Not gonna happen. We don't even have full sanctions on Russia yet. Plenty of trade is still happening. But Russia is nowhere near as important as China for Western economies. If we ban trade with China, we mostly hurt ourselves, not China.
China can sanction US and EU too, like stop buying anything from US and EU, or stop selling ? Both are good.
That was pretty good. I’d add that China will pretty much have to write off Taiwan as a to-do item for this century if Russia is soundly defeated in Ukraine. So if the Taiwan issue ‘’ they pretty much have to support Russia with lethal aid. But you are correct, you’d think they’d be a little nuts to jack up their current economic clout.
