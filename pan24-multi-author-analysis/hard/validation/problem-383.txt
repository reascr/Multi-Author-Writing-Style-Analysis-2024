Back in March Lukashenko had a meeting in which he showed a map that was most likely the actual invasion map the Russians were using for Ukraine. On it are plans to invade Moldova after Ukraine is subjugated.
Russia would need to conquer South Ukraine to have any chance at any military occupation of Moldova. All the more reason to give more weapons and equipment to Ukraine.
For Russia to attack Moldova they would first have to secure the South of Ukraine. Moldova is landlocked. In any case, Russia would have to cross over Ukrainian soil. Russia would have to at least capture and defend Odessa and it s surrounding area.
Oddly enough, this was part of Russia's plan in the beginning. In a way, Ukraine is actually rescuing Moldova, by holding out themselves. Because I can guarantee you, if Russia was successful in Ukraine, Moldova would have quickly been next.
I think Moldova is a red herring Russia is drumming up support for by proxy to fuel more volunteers against Ukraine.
Russians may have war fatigue against Ukraine now or may start having doubts. Moldova would be a good way to convince them that this is an ‘easy’ victory but first they must plough through Ukraine.
