Well yeah, but a Patriot system costs $1billion per system, while the S-300 is only $150million. So you can have 6 S-300 systems for the price of one Patriot.... That's not to mention that each Patriot missile costs $4 million per shot.
Yes, but does the added cost give you significant benefits to make it worth it to buy one Patriot system, instead of 6 S-300 systems?
Another point to make, is that the Patriot system costs 1billion per system, while an S-400 system is only 300million, with the S-300 only costing 150million... The cost benefit analysis heavily favors the Russian systems.
Well they're basically the same system... S-400's are what they say are more advanced, as they claim they are capable of targeting stealth planes.
The baseline S-300 missiles are out of production in favor of newer S-400 and S-400V variants, the S-300 being 1980s tech at this point. Russian stockpiles are deep though.
Russia claims a lot of thing. If you want an example look at how overyhped the MiG-25 was and how it made the us spent a fortune making one of the best jets in the world, before a MiG-25 pilot landed one in Japan and the US realised it was way worse that what was claimed.
