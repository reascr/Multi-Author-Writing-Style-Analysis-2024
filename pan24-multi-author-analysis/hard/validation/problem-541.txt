The Chinese have few allies... what?? North Korea, a depleted and embarrassed Russia, a dangerous Iran, but those allies alone are nothing compared to the alliances the west have with NATO, and Oceania countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Malaysia and even India..
3rd.. the Chinese military would be crippled for a decade(s)... Like Russia's path right now.. because the United States and our NATO Alliance would choke and strangle Chinese military, industry, trade routes.
Lets hope it NEVER comes to this... there has been peace on the Chinese mainland since it's Civil War ended in 1949, where the defeated Chiang Kai-shek escaped to Taiwan and founding of that independent nation island.
Fun fact, from 1949-1971, Republic of China (Taiwan) was the sole representative of China in United of Nation, while PRC was established in 1949.
It's the matter between ROC and PRC from the beginning. And ROC was also responsible for PRC's birth by exerting too much McCarthyism internally to Chinese people during post WW2 era, furthermore people just revolted against ROC (with that to one of the biggest issue, along with poverty, inflations, corruptions...etc).
