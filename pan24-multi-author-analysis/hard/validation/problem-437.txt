If someone was posting my location live on twitter, i would sue and consider it bullying... if someone did it to my neighbour, as a good christian, i would blame my neighbour while laughing of course.
The same way, i would expect you to use the car you bought and placing a tracker on it would equal to tracking you.
Honest question here : how many times does Musk uses his private jet himself compared to the amout of times his jet would fly without him... Because the reasonable expectation would be that if he has a private jet, he would be using it himself and thus tracking his private jet would equal to tracking him.
Unless of course you can provide data proving that Musk isn't inside his jet for a significant amount of the travels his jet makes... then you would have an argument.
Musk is a public figure and all jets have flight plans that are public records. Let me ask you, are you listed in a telephone directory? Even if not your residence is in a directory somewhere. Public records are just that. Public. If someone wants to attack Musk the records are out there. Even if someone knows what city Musk is in they won't know where.
