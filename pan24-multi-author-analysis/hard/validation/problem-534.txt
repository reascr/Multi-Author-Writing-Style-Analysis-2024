Not in this case. Due to another Colorado law, the shooter's records were sealed and would not have raised any 'red flags' when he bought the gun. The point OP is making has nothing to do with the recent shooting.
You get that it's not the sheriff's job to initiate one of these ERPOs, right? The sheriff said that he won't initiate the seizure paperwork without due process, but will definitely execute a seizure if a warrant is issued. No warrant was issued for the shooter, and prior charges were dismissed.
Completely agree that he should have had his guns taken away, but I don't think that should be up to the sheriff to decide. In fact in this specific example the request to seize would have been denied by a court, due to the records of this guy being sealed when the case against him was dismissed. It's a tough balance. The law doesn't want to ruin someone's future over dismissed charges, but we still need to keep a record of past behavior.
A prosecutor noting the family doesnâ€™t want to press charges still has time to trigger the red flag law if they deem it appropriate.
Colorado automatically seals record that did not lead to prosecution over the course of months, not days. The records were sealed well after the incident in question.
The records were sealed because the case was dismissed. The case was most likely dismissed because the standoff was initiated by a single phone call made by his mother. If she says, I was mistaken, he never threatened me, or anyone else with a bomb, plus the fact that no bomb was found, would make this an incredibly hard case to prosecute.
