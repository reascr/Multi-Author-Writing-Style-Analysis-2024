Those countries also have great social safety nets that we don't here. Huge difference when you're taxing everyone to actually do good vs taxing so that the rich can have an extra mansion.
Who do you think will end up owning all the houses, if buying one for yourself costs 30% extra in tax while buying more for your rental portfolio is tax free? (And then the renter is the one paying the tax on each rent payment.).
That's the thing. Rich people don't pay taxes anyway so in order to generate revenue to cover the losses from removing income taxes, they have to tax things poor people buy-- namely gas and food.
They try to dupe people who have trouble understanding that a lower income person or a person with little property will pay much more on a per Capita basis than a wealthy person without progressive taxes like income tax which they hate so much. Property taxes in particular end up being really problematic in lots of places since low income areas end up starved for funding for schools and infrastructure even after raising their mil rates as much as possible while wealthy areas can keep those rates at a minimum to fund top of the line services.
It's very common for property taxes on a percentage/mil rate basis to be super high in lower and middle income areas than in wealthier ones since the rich folks can easily fund services if they have huge houses or a diverse tax base. They'll try to argue though that somehow this is NOT a regressive tax because they pay more on a dollar for dollar basis (just like they might with a national sales tax scheme) although that is totally misleading.
Oh, no, they know exactly what they're doing: It's not actually a universal sales tax, but a selective 30% tax on "personal consumption"... Meaning zero tax tax on people with enough extra capital to insert themselves as middlemen, retailers, speculators, or landlords.
