People have lost their minds. Just saw a Facebook post about that podcast Ye walked out of, and so many black people still say they support ye. Even asking me how is Nick Fuentes a white supremist? I shared two videos, which anyone with working brain cells can see he is. Make it make sense, cause if someone said they hate Jews, as a Jewish person, I would not be all, well let's hear him out.
The only thing a christian nationalist anti-semite hates more than Jews is Muslims. They'd rather have Jews in charge there versus palestinians.
yep, fuentes working with Kanye West is a perfect example of this. Fuentes has said some horrible things about black people and I'm going to guess he's not a fan of rap.
Also as stated below if you look into Christian eschatology it is true that this is believed. Hell it’s in Catholic doctrine. I didn’t make this up. I literally learned it in Catholic school.
Also a lot of crazy evangelicals and christian nationalists believe the rapture or some sort of christain version of the end times will come when the Jews are able to rebuild the third temple on the site of the temple mount (which is al-aqsa mosque). So they support Israel's hardliners who want to make that happen.
I know for a fact a lot of Republicans support Israel. Fox News constantly has segments that are supportive of Israel. Republicans also supported Trump's policies on Israel.
