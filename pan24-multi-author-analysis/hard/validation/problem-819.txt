As an Arizonan, I'm not concerned if the town of Pine sends a crazy to the state house. They be crazy up there.
Whats cool is Dems have a small chance to control the state senate. Would be the first time in my life I think that either house wasn't under GOP control.
Mailed ballots sent in before Monday/Tuesday are counted first. State statute (guess who made that law) says you have to count e-day votes before early ballots dropped off on election day.
The delay in results here is mostly from early ballots dropped off on election day. 290k in Maricopa County alone. There are also batches of ballots that were processed, but have yet to be counted, that were dropped off right before ED.
Apparently there was a massive amount of mail-in ballots turned in on Election Day. Those ballots take longer to process because of the signature verification process.
Signature verification of mail in ballots is required by Arizona law. It has been for decades. It's not some new conspiracy to suppress Dem votes.
