People point that to a sign that the group is a false flag, but that is ridiculous. Just like Walt Disney's great niece (Roy's granddaughter) publicly calls out Disney for how they treat employees, a descendant can be wealthy from inherited wealth from oil and speak out against it. It is slightly more hypocritical than just giving all their inheritance away, but it is better than nothing.
Making the public actively hate you isn't helpful either though. They don't have to love you, but if they hate you then they may not purposefully hurt the environment (although rednecks do that by rolling coal), but the sure as hell will remember when given the choice of putting in effort to help the environment or doing less work and hurting it (such as holding onto a bottle to recycle it or throwing it out in a nearby trashcan).
If climate change is the problem then for forcing people to idle in their cars before continuing their drive is a pretty counterproductive method of helping.
ITT: Morons complain about being slightly inconvenienced in traffic, but don't give a flying fuck about CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE CHANGE is the problem, not your minor inconvenience.
We need more protests like this one. Governments STILL aren't doing enough to mitigate the effects of climate change, so we need MORE PRESSURE like protests that block roads and fossil fuel business entrances. Only REAL PRESSURE that affects the economy is going to work, because most politicians only care about money. They don't care about normal peaceful protests that don't disrupt anything. They ignore those protests because those politicians being bribed by the fossil fuel industry. The only way for us to overcome the power of bribery is to prevent the fossil fuel industry from making money to make those bribes. It's time for the fossil fuel industry to pay for all the damage it has done to the planet and everyone's health. If our governments won't make them pay, we should make them pay by disrupting their businesses. Our survival depends on it.
