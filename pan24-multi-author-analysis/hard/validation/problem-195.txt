Well, your party fared better with one of its idiots…Republicans pick em’ but can’t elect em’ Dems found Fetterman or woman, and he won Another basement candidate, just like Biden…Republicans need a good dose of campaigning 101.
They would have done much better to nominate a bog-standard GOP congressperson- or just to troll Trump, Brad Raffensberger- who wouldn't scare the suburbanites.
It's not just that he's a uniquely bad candidate- who still got 48% of the vote- it's that he's running against a uniquely elegant Democrat, a guy with a PhD who turned his thesis into a well-respected book on black theology and the history of the black church. Warnock is morally and literally the heir of Martin Luther King- occupying his pulpit- and while he's got some warts, running Walker against him proves that the GOP really does think black people are stupid. Do they really think that Walker would peel off black votes from Warnock, a legendary black activist and intellectual giant?
I would not be surprised Walker says half the stupid shit he does knowing full well its ridiculous but would reassure some white voters.
Walker should be a ridiculous candidate. He should have been laughed out of the primaries. But here we are.
In practice, when that football player has significant mental health concerns, a violent and otherwise questionable history of poor moral character, and is essentially incapable of expressing a rational thought...the worst case scenario for Republicans was is that he still somehow had an incredibly close race, despite a notable number of Republican voters splitting their ticket pro-Kemp and no-vote or Warnock Senate.
In theory, the basic idea had merit. Run a black football star in Georgia - attempt to appeal to the people who can't see past "football celebrity" and undercut Warnock's racial identity as a factor.
