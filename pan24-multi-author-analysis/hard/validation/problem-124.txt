Well the US army is under 500k whereas the Russian army on one of their borders has just under 1M men. Their army is currently larger than the US army by quite a bit. Does the US have equipment and manpower to (if this article is accurate) triple the size of their army in less than a year? Probably... Lol... It is however a massive undertaking.
I agree, however Ukraine will run out of manpower long before Russia will... Even trading 20:1... So economic crash is best hope to emd the war.
So instead of fighting the war NATO hopes their economy will collapse or infighting will take them down. Ukraine however cannot replace every combat age man (approx 60k training in Europe amd the US). Ukraine is hoping 60k conscripts will counter the 100k man advantage Russia curfently has/had. (Approx 1M russians to 800k Ukranians). ukraine can maybe squeeze out 1M but Russia will conscript up to 1.5M... Its not an escalation Ukraine can win.
What I want more than anything is for the west to supply Ukraine so it can defeat russia on its own. Ukrainians know what they need to achieve victory, and so far theyâ€™re not really getting it.
A 'quick' Ukrainian victory would require direct intervention by Nato. At the start of the invasion, that would have probably meant escalation into a world war, which as it turns out, Russia would have lost (but no one really knew that for sure), assuming China didn't get involved, because a European ground war would be a perfect moment for China to seize Taiwan. Who do you want to feed to the wolves?
