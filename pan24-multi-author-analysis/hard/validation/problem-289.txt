How it should work is the federal government should replace student loans with interest free loans and income based repayments that are forgiven after 10 years if not repaid in full.
Right there… the requirement is the payback of the loan… the student financial assistance program is the program that gives out the loans (i.e., requirement to payback). The summary reading of that law that I provided makes it abundantly clear it’s about waiving the requirements to pay back loans from the student financial assistance programs.
The way it reads to me seems pretty specific to loans (“requirements”) and the student financial assistance programs. I’m looking at the actual law now. You’re right, people can read this and argue over what exactly was meant for each and every potential case, just like any other law. But I don’t think it’s broad… here, see for . To me, that’s pretty specific and seems to fall right in line with the EdSec’s arguments to allow this go forward. I honestly think the only way to attack this is for the Supreme Court to reeeeaaaallly step all over a co-equal branch of the government. This law was introduced in the house, by the power of the purse, and sailed right through the senate without amendments and landed on the presidents desk. COVID has killed more Americans than any attack on our country ever, and all people experienced hardship (and still are). The law was meant for a moment like this, so it would be fed up for the Supreme Court to intervene.
Why are you making shit up and acting correct? The law specifically allows waivers to student financial aid. If you don’t believe me, you can read about it on congress’ website .
Right, would be up to Congress to act in that case. Technically they do have US Marshals, but they are part of Executive Branch even if they take orders from court.
