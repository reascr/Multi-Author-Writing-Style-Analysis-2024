Do they honestly think God gives a shit about whether their football team wins? I mean seriously. What is it with Christian nationalism and the idea of sports somehow implying some sort of divine favor?
They wrote the constitution, so the conventions they used must have been particular. So Iâ€™d say a well regulated militia means one that is governed consistently under rule of law.
Alexander Hamilton had the best description when he argued against having ALL men in a "well regulated" militia:
Actually it would be perfectly appropriate in a civics or US History class. Maybe the teacher's wearing the tee shirt is a bit much, but seeing both shirts in class would be a good motivator to discuss both sides of the issue.
Actually a "Well Regulated Militia" in 1775 meant exactly what existed in Lexinon and Concord on April 19th of that year: An armed troop of local men who were in a government regulated force which had regularly trained in military maneuvers on the "village green.".
Well not really. In my high school students got sent home or otherwise punished for wearing shirts with alcohol products depicted, references to drugs, etc. Hell in my middle school they cracked down on kids wearing pajama pants (I've always thought that was ridiculous). Then of course there are the standard dress code rules about skirt lenhs etc. But yeah, historically schools do control what kids can wear.
Don't most PUBLIC schools have dress restrictions with respect to disruptive attire? Whether this T-shirt should be considered such is a judgment call, and I could see reasons to believe banning it would be, er, overkill.
