Plenty of cultures eat insects (good source of protein!), it isn't any weirder than eating snails in France or shrimp in general. Certainly it isn't shockingly inhumane, especially in a situation where they literally can only eat what they can farm or grow on a moving train.
These are people who not too long ago ate each other to survive, and they act like getting nutrition from mashed up insects is a horrifying and debasing thing.
FULL DISCLAIMER- i am an american and have had the luxury of never having needed to eat insects as part of my diet to survive and do indeed, find them gross.
I really do wonder what the people who want to eat insects in this thread are really like and why they think eating insects is fine. Do they think it’s exotic? Or do they do it out of ethical reasons? Do they realize rich people will never touch the stuff or at least no more than they touch fast food or shit from the frozen food section?
That isn’t it, or else the horror would be when they discovered the rich people’s food cars. Those scenes are more understandably anger.
