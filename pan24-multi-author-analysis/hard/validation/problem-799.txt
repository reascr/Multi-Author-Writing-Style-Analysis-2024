Russia hasnâ€™t fought many wars in the past 100 years. Also that time frame excludes the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, and the Polish-Soviet War, which were all pretty embarrassing losses.
What the Russians forgot is that WW2 was a unique situation. Imagine for a moment if America were invaded by demons. These demons killed soldiers, civilians, women, children, babies. They raped teenagers to death. They smashed babies against brick walls to kill them. They burned everything to the ground behind them, and they wanted you to know that they would do the same to you if they got you.
Now, in that context, with tens of millions of dead, with the demons pushing forward towards the last bastions of civilians, if you were a soldier would some landmines be a big deal to you? You're going to hurl yourself at those demons and of everything that could happen to you, being blown up by a landmine is one of the nicer ways to go.
Edit: in short, if you have to clear a minefield under fire and you don't have a mine clearing vehicle with you, you're going to take a lot of casualties.
The minefields that we train for are about 100m deep, so we will need 2 line charges. So some dude needs to run to the start of the minefield, set up the charge and blow a path halfway.
Another dude then needs to rune halfway into the minefield, along the path that was just cleared, set up the 2nd charge to clear the remaining path.
