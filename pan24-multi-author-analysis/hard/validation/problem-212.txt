I was telling my Thai wife how the lunch staff will throw away kids food in front of them if their parents have not paid the tab. She was dumbfounded. Every kid in Thailand gets a pretty nice free lunch.
It's criminal that we haven't addressed this in this country. Maybe it is because we've had programs in the past but I'm sure there are more kids that have food insecurity these days then 20 or 30 years ago.
And something I figured out on here is that if some kids are getting free lunches and other kids aren't, there will be bullying about this. Jesus fuck this is such a no-brainer. This is the kind of bread and butter shit the Democrats should be running on.
Why would Democrats run on "Stop the Steal" when doing so would make our elections less secure with their idiotic policies? Because they want dead people to vote Democrat!
Don't mistake the democrats' intent. They're still pro-corporation neoliberals. They aren't interested in spending tax dollars that help the middle class unless they have to.
