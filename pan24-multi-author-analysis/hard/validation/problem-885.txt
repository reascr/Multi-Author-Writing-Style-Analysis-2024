Tbh I think it’s the Chinese leadership just throwing a hissy fit because they didn’t get their way with ‘Zero Covid’ policies, primarily because they almost faced the first ever Chinese revolution, but also because they hate their own citizenry who they look down on like insects.
“You told us to stop our Zero Covid policy, so enjoy the over-packed hospitals, we’re not helping any more” -all Chinese politicians overlords.
Russia is quickly rediscovering reality again in the form of Ukrainian defiance, and China; from a pandemic that every other country on the planet has managed to get under control, except them.
I think what they actually implemented was a ‘close your eyes, cover your ears, and hope for the best’ policy. Yeah Russia and China just decided they want the world to hate them this year, apparently. So they’re both acting-out and lying to the point where they think they can just create their own reality.
I guess when the lie has a certain intent and purpose, it will keep being used for the same reasons and so we get the same lies again and again.
