This is how you get a Ukraine working towards being nuclear armed by any means. Countries like France etc don't seem to understand that this is an existential crisis for Ukraine and they don't intend to ever give Russia the opportunity to do this again. In years to come when Europe has a Ukraine pulling clandestine actions for self preservation some leaders will act all surprised. But the general public won't be.
One thing is obvious, when it comes to Russia and Ukraine, there's no going back to the status quo or handicapping Ukraine to appease Russia. France hasn't yet understood this.
I worry that not only France don't get this yet. Russia is a bully that doesn't respect any norms and is not following western logic.
It is obvious that in order to survive Ukraine has to have nuclear capacity or conventional equivalent. With potential to deliver destruction to Russian territory.
You are assuming too much. Ukraine needs to be able to defend itself and strike Russia on its own territory. Just as Poland.
