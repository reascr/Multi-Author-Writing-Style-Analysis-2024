Because they have successfully indoctrinated their base to believe that everything bad is someone else's fault, and the donors owners of the Republican party also happen to own the major media outlets; the very same outlets who consistently and all too frequently put the onus for every single fucking thing going on in American politics on the Democrats even -- and especially -- when it's the Republicans actually causing problems.
So Republicans can burn the house down, admit to it openly, and cheer on the flames... and yet somehow it's always the fault of the Democrats for not stopping Republican arson, or not being able to put out the fire quickly, or not cleaning up quickly enough. Republicans never admit fault, and even if they did their voters wouldn't give a shit, and the donors won't care because they're there to get their tax cuts and other handouts like PPP.
The only calamity McCarthy cares about is losing the Speakership, so he probably doesn't care one way or the other if the rest of us get screwed by GOP power games.
