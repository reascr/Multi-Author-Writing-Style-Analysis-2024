"We are often told they are much bigger, their army is way larger, they have more resources, and there are far fewer of us. Never say that to countries that love Freedom more than anything! Never say that to us or to our Finnish brothers. Your words mean nothing to us or to them.".
Yeah. I absolutely will not hear anyone try to tell me Erdogan is doing anything out of benevolence. He wants Ukraine to thrash Russia so that he has more leverage over the entire Black Sea / Caucuses region.
Russia needs to control the Black Sea. And to control the Black Sea, they must control the Bosporus.
Turkey knows damn well that if Russia succeeds, they may not be next on Russia's list, but they're not that far down.
Turkey doesn't want Russia to win, but they do not want them to lose badly either. They know their usefulness to the West is dependent on Russia being a threat and that if that threat were to go away then the West might actually start paying attention to areas they usually left up to Turkey.
Another look at the creep of propaganda (masked as Patriotism .. what is the difference?) into the Russian education system. It's in Russian, so hit that translate button.
Sergey Sobyanin, the Mayor of Moscow, has/had been doing a good job at keeping his name clear of association with the War, along with keeping the war out of Moscow (i.e. keeping the city clear of anything that might indicate there was a war going on). Other than that, the guy is most known for his fondness of building projects.
Of course Putin controls who gets to run for what and he wouldn't let Moscow be ran by someone he doesn't trust implicitly and Putin benefits from his capital being kept calm and the best way to do this is let them think there isnt a war going on.
