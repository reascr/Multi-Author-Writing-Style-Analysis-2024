Defense ties between the two run deep. It's worth noting that despite the fact that Azerbaijan is Shi'ite majority, like Iran, it is closer in nearly every single sense to Turkey, which would mean it has no problem aligning itself with Israel.
I hope that countries like Azerbaijan work to have a genuine, warm, constructive peace with Israel, and then work with other Muslim countries to organize an intervention and to try to get both ultra nationalist Israelis and ultra nationalists Palestinians to calm down.
It's often terrifying on r/Palestine, but the tone in these comments on r/Israel is very hostile toward anyone even 1 degree away from a really hawkish, isolationist kind of approach to governance and foreign policy.
But, at the same time, when people who support Israel write in a super dismissive, hostile, uncompromising, self-pitying way, those people chip away at that public relations asset.
When people go on r/Israel and post posts implying that the Bedouin are all a bunch of rapists, or obsess about how negative they believe world news organizations are about Israel, that makes Israel look less strong.
When Israel sends expert teams to enemy or neutral countries to help those countries cope with terrible disasters, that makes Israel look strong.
When Israel brings 100 sick children from all over the world, including Gaza, to give those children top treatment, that makes Israel look strong.
When Israel gives great medical care to injured Syrian or Palestinian fighters, that makes Israel look strong.
The strong public relations campaign Israel has going for it is the kind of hatefulness that many supporters of Palestine display. Even if some sane governments criticize Israel, or even impose sanctions on it, they all know that having a region ruled by Hamas on its borders would be horrible. Deep down, they all know that dealing with Hamas and Iran/Hezbollah is a nightmare.
