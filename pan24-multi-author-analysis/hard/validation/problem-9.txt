They have a near endless supply. How much was it, 1000 soldier died per day? Russia has 20 million men between 18 and 40, assuming no one gets born anymore, at this rate it'll take 100 years before they run into issues.
Irrelevant, you can still send them into a war. A very significant part of the Russian soldiers in Ukraine right now comes from the eastern parts.
Oh there are plenty of issues already, but that isn't stopping them. Let's say they only throw 10% of the eligible population at it, you're still looking at a 10 year war.
If you think you can get 9/10 of a population onto the battlefield you're delusional. If you think you can make more than 1/10 of a population into something more effective than cannon fodder, especially in a single year, you're insane.
But you're acting like Russia didn't also have to deal with covid. Also they were facing a demographic cliff to begin with. Russia had fewer young people and is now burning through them or they're fleeing the country.
Realistically, you only get close to a quarter of the population fighting when the fight is in their backyard.
