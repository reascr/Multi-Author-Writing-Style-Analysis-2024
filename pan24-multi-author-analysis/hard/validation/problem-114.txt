How is she a spoiler for D's? The only group where she has favorable numbers is with R's and they won't won't vote for her en masse over a moderate R candidate. Same with a D candidate who will have Kelly, Hobbs, Fontes, etc. stumping for them. In a three way race she siphons more votes from R's than D's.
To run as an indy she'll need 3% of total registered voters who are not members of a ballot-qualified political party (per ballotpedia and AZleg.gov), that's about 42k+. Obviously, her team feels that's attainable, but where... Also, I can see both parties challenging the signatures to keep her off the ballot.
It seems more like she's banking on the D's not fielding a candidate and letting her run, should she choose. That's the only thing that makes sense to me at the moment. It doesn't make sense for the local or national party to be OK with that as Kelly has won twice, Hobbs has won, Fontes has won, and there are attractive/qualified candidates who could run (Gallego, heck even Hobbs) and her "stance" isn't inline with the electorate anymore.
Perhaps. I don't see it, she's very unpopular with everyone and a Murkowski-esque effort isn't that feasible for her.
If she’s the only candidate I still wouldn’t vote for her. She betrayed us in so many ways after we elected her in good faith. She might as well have an R next to her name.
