It gives morons something to talk about. They gonna be asking why isn't Biden firing Harris already so he can set up his hand picked replacement now that the midterms are over and Harris isn't who he wanted anyway.
If Biden did anything, it would be resign and let Harris be President to see how she does and then she competes with Democratic field in the primaries.
Biden unilaterally overriding the voters (which I don’t think is legal) to replace the first female VP (who is also a POC) with a slick white guy sounds like a great way to turn off your base. Not to mention it makes Newsom look like he couldn’t win the primaries on his own but needed help to get there. Plus, I think he’s a bad national candidate (I’m a Californian and have voted for him several times but think his inauthenticity won’t play against more competition, and also until the homelessness issue is somewhat solved California candidate will be a hard sell.).
So this idea that would destroy the Democrats’ popularity entirely was written by a former Republican White House staffer… not weird at all.
If a conservative wants to try to sabotage the party that just stomped his own by giving terrible advice, he could at least try to be sly about it. This is just openly partisan and moronic.
