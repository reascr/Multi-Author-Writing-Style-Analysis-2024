Did the daughter even know about her absentee ballot? Maybe the Douche Pickle just put her down as absentee because he knew she would vote opposite of the Râ€™s?
Why would he sign her up for absentee if he thought she would vote against him? Sounds like she lives and has residency in a different state, so he got her signed up thinking it would be a free vote for him. Then she voted against him, so he ratted her out for voting illegally.
Voter fraud is messing with your vote (e.g. voting more times than you're allowed to). Election fraud is messing with other people's votes.
Election fraud, on the other hand, racks up into the tens of thousands during every election. Especially voter suppression. Wish I could say it's always strictly a red state problem. But red states sure do more than their share of it.
I'm sure their bogus email is still getting passed around conservative circles. What are they supposed to be up to now? a couple thousand murders? Or have they passed 10,000 already?

They even checked around the country - nobody chartered that many busses anywhere. Often, conservative accusations don't even make sense.
