And they just decided to do that once America signalled that they wanted to buy Venezuelan oil again and was willing to sit down and talk to Maduro which is pretty awkward if the US didn't recognize his government...
Yes, I agree it was rather shameful, however let's not pretend like the US was solely propping him up- there was a lot of legitimate support within Venezuela as Maduro was becoming more and more of a dictator and abusing power, increasing corruption, etc.
Oh well, a foreign government doesn't recognise a democratically elected President, gosh, I guess the people of Venezuela should run to the polls and elect someone the Americans do approve of, regardless of what they actually want.
This is funny considering Venezuela doesn't even recognize him as president, as shown by their vote a few days ago. The EU hasn't for like 2-3 years now?
Why do people make stupid ass jokes that aren't funny to begin with then proceed to get butthurt and edit their comment to say no one has a sense of humor?
I get that half of this country doesn't recognize Biden. The fact doesn't make it any less stupid, nothing funny about it considering that trump's dumb ass opened Pandora's box and has destroyed democracy as we knew it.
