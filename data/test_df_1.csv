16874,"> - Based on a Maamar of the Lubavitch Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, it is learned that meditation and prayer, while spiritually transformative, do not match the power of doing business ethically (Padah B’Shalom, 5739). The Admor of Belz, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, in discussing the angels descending and ascending on the ladder seen in the dream of Ya'akov, notes that the gematria value of sulam, ladder, is equivalent to that of kesef, money. The teaching here is that while a few are able to ascend spiritually in the way they earn and spend their money others, instead, descend here.","44 “‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.",1,1,1141

Corruption and self-interests dominate the political landscape, thus no politician or party can canalize the feelings of anger at the present state of politics. What Castillo did only ended up bursting a dam of anger and resentment accumulating for decades at the political class.

It's just that the ideological struggle quickly gave pass to serious acussations of corruption on Castillo's family and advisors. Believe me that at the beggining everyone that wasn't full anti-Castillo had doubts on the accusations, but that was more than a year ago. What started as a discovery of 20,000 bucks on his secretary's toilet and suspicous ascensions in the Army; now are accusations of his nephews demanding money from the intelligence service, corruption networks inside the Ministry of Transport & Communications by one of the ministers he fiercely defended, or what appears to be another network to assign construction projects in his home province of Chota to the best briber.",0,1,1941
