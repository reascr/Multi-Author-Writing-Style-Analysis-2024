Then, before the craze really kicked off (1672) the death penalty was banned without express consent by the High Court, but those local civil courts just did what they wanted anyways. The High Court actually sent out agents to interrupt witch trials, most notably in Łęczyca 1702 and Przemyśl 1756. Despite that, it doesn't appear that local courts got the message.

8547,"The region of Southern China/Northern India/large parts of northern Southeast Asia, technically known as the Southeast Asian Massif but famously named Zomia by Willem Van Schendel and James C. Scott, is considered one of the least governable regions on Earth. Mountainous terrain combined with a tropical/subtropical climate and high incidence of diseases such as malaria made it very difficult for states of any kind to effectively rule this region. For most of modern history, the Massif was dominated by a coterie of very ethnically and linguistically diverse groups of people, who often lived in smaller tribes and communities. Because of how hard this area was to govern, many bandits and rebels in China (and other states) would flee to this region and use it as a staging ground to either launch a war or simply raid nearby settlements. As such, many Chinese Empires saw controlling this region as vital to their own internal stability. Additionally, this region also had a large number of copper and salt mines, both very lucrative resources in Chinese Imperial history (copper was used as the most common form of currency, and salt was a vital resource in the preservation of meats).","You may have misuderstood me.

That they excell at is diesel maintenance and repair, which is why the Challenger is a better fit for UAF than the Abrams. Secondly, tanks are very thirsty and would require refueling 3 or 4x a day, which means added trucks and soldiers are needed to keep fuel in the tanks. The Bradley is an excellent choice as it ticks all the boxes... it's diesel, it's armored, it can kill tanks (pretty easily if the Gulf War is any indication) and engage infantry alike, and can carry a squad of heavily armed and thoroughly pissed off UAF soldiers in the back. They are more agile and maneuverable than a tank, as well as more fuel efficient. I would argue more Infantry Fighting Vehicles is what is needed.

The main cause of those deaths is drugs that are laced with another drug like fentanyl, or the fact that there is a no consistency in the purity of the drugs they consume so even if they take the same amount they usually use, there's always the risk that it's an especially pure batch that they got this time and they could still overdose from the same amount they normally consume. The model also assumes that people who aren't users of heroin or other hard drugs, aren't going to just start using because it's available. If you were walking down the street and could buy heroin, would you? I know I wouldn't knowing the facts about use, and that's likely true for the majority of the population.

And just because an empty house exists somewhere doesn't mean it's somewhere where jobs and opportunities are, so even if we did go with the populist option of just seizing empty homes and giving them as handouts to the poor, that wouldn't necessarily help the poor in many instances. Also, if we did something like that, it could massively deincentivize future production of new housing, since potential developers and future buyers would see how property rights aren't being respected and thus that investing in new housing could be a bad idea. So the whole ""use existing empty housing"" is kind of just a dead end.","r/politics is currently accepting new moderator applications.

10255,"So let's do a little thought experiment. First we need to assign a dollar value for voting because, let's face it, a singular vote does not carry too much actual value when you consider it's singular value needs to be weighed against it's value in the grand scheme of things which is a one thousandth, one ten thousandth, or even a one hundred thousandth share in order to effect the outcome of an election even if you cared very much about that outcome. So let's grab the craziest, hyper loud maga and offer them one thousand dollars if they themselves did not vote. Nobody in their right mind would turn that down unless the pool of voters was unrealistically small in which case this raises the value of the singular vote. This is a crazy high end offer but we'll place the value at 1000 dollars. Now let's add a risk into the equation. Say you were notified that you MAY be on the hook for a felony conviction in which case you will lose your freedom, your job, and everything else that comes with a felony conviction which makes it pretty much impossible to survive in society from this point forward. What numerical money value would YOU be willing to gain for even a chance at such a penalty. If the reward is one thousand dollars and my chances at a ruined life were even 100 to one, I'm personally opting out. Remember, these people were notified BY THE STATE, that they may be on the hook for a felony if they vote.

The Court has usually (not always) been a force for progressive change if anything, and when it has ruled in a bad way (like in Plessy or Korematsu) , it was usually to rubber stamp something already happening, not to change the law for the worse like it did in Dobbs. On the other hand, in cases like Miranda v. Arizona, Brown v. Board of Education, Worcester v. Georgia, and Roe v. Wade itself, the Court came to a VERY progressive but probably unpopular or controversial positions that would have been jeopardized had the public, Congress, or the President known what was going to happen. Congress even passed a law trying to undo Miranda after it was decided, but the Court struck that law down (iirc weirdly enough a conservative justice who was AGAINST Miranda wrote the opinion saying Congress had no power to overturn it). In my opinion the idea that the Justices shouldn't deliberate in private is something that sounds like a good idea but would have been disastrous historically.

There are also certain treatments that decrease cost overall, but are not properly funded because the entity that would save money is not the entity that pays for it. The lack of access to good preventative care is also a problem. If there was a single payer, then there will be much greater emphasis on prevention of illness. Also how certain treatments are reimbursed needs to change. If conservative management of a problem (for instance a medication) is just as helpful as a procedure (such as surgery) then the treatment should be reimbursed the same. There is not much incentive for surgeons not to do surgery when it pays so much better.

When Japan surrendered, Nemoto received the help of Chiang Kai-shek in ensuring the safe return of the troops under his command, and he later sneaked out of Japan (which was under lock-down by the GHQ) to Taiwan to meet Chiang and to help in the defense of Kinmen. He told his family that he was going fishing and left home with a fishing rod. After the battle at Kinmen, he returned with his fishing rod and never talked about his role in the battle. His participation was kept secret by Taiwan until around 2011 when the descendants of Nemoto wanted to retrace his path, eventually leading to a semi-official recognition of Nemoto's contribution in the battle. A Japanese TV station made a documentary of the process.",台湾独立最急的不是中国反而是美国，你以为台湾是钳制中国的棋子？真是天真的外国人，有个事实永远无法改变，台湾是东亚的岛屿，它飞不走，早收晚收其实并没有多大区别，它不是钳制中国的棋子，而是钳制美国的一张牌，我们假设中国真的收复了台湾，那我们反而没有借口对东部用兵了，反而吊着这块肉不吃，我们随时可以找理由动手把美国拖下水，你们不得不在东亚布署更多兵力，如果中美有一天开战，你们觉得战场选在哪里比较好勒，对中国而言当然是东亚开战最为有利，理由也很简单，虽然战场放在东亚会导致经济受损，但胜利的机会会大的多的多，因为东亚是中国的主战场，中国每一条高速公路都可以起飞战斗机，每一个山里的军事基地都能发射导弹，而东亚美军战力虽然不弱，但他们只能依靠岛屿进行孤立防御，一旦发生战争，补给十分困难。相反如果战争发生在除东亚的地方，美国在全球有几百个补给基地，根本打不赢，所以中国如果真想与美国战争必定会把美国全部兵力拖死在东亚，通过更充沛的导弹和后勤拖垮东亚的美军。毛泽东当年能够轻易收复金门岛，但他就是没这么做，理由很简单，金门如果在台湾手里，他们就得派大量人力物力与中国对峙，双方就不算断了联系，反而如果收复金门岛，台湾彻底与中国隔绝，反而容易产生独立，这才是他的计谋，通过金门岛牵制台湾政府，你们不觉得台湾就像曾经的金门岛？中国收复台湾没有任何国际法律上的问题，几乎所有的国家都承认台湾属于中国，和乌克兰不同，时至今日没人会觉得中国是武力不足以占领台湾，但就是不动手，理由有两个，一，时间站在中国这边，美国是衰落帝国，王朝衰亡不可避免，这是自然历史规律，但中国恰恰处于朝代兴盛期，还没有达到顶峰，拖个5年10年恐怕不用动手也能解决问题，二，你以为能用台湾钳制中国，其实恰恰是中国让你们以为你们钳制住了中国，台湾对中国可有可无，更多的是地理战略上的作用，能够让中国更方便的向太平洋扩展力量，你们以为中国就想得到台湾？不不不，如果我是中国领导人，我想得到的肯定不仅仅是台湾，而是等一个足够的机会完美的拔除东亚的全部美军势力，借台湾拖日本下水。收复台湾有什么用，还不是改变不了美军依然在东亚有基地的事实，不拔掉美国在东亚的钉子，我们可不会安心，中日血仇只有战争才能洗刷，只有当日本驻军被拔除，日本才能重新获得独立，中日才能和平，借台湾为借口，一次战争解决三个问题。为了这次平定东亚之战，需要做更多的准备，我倒是希望能用战争解决问题。这样问题解决的才彻底，如果美国怂了，反而不利于东亚问题的解决，如果只是解决台湾问题而不是解决日本问题，那么未来美国一定会卷土重来，美国的大陆是一个更大的岛屿，远离世界人口的主体区域，注定这个文明一定会挑起战争，就像曾经的英国一样，英国挑起法德争斗导致世界大战，他们借此获利，美国远离世界，所以他们自以为不会被战争波及本土，所以他们才是天然的战争罪犯，通过挑起亚洲欧洲非洲的国家相同争斗而借此获利，这是他们天然的地理优势所决定的，当战争能够获得利益且不会波及自身，人类的罪恶就会被释放，必须让他们知道他们并不是绝对安全的，战争一样会波及他们，毁灭他们，才能让其收敛挑起战争的本性走向合作上来。以斗争求和平则和平存，以妥协求和平则和平亡。为什么强大的国家会欺负弱小国家？那是因为那些曾经的欺负的人没有付出代价，他们记不住战争的苦，自然不懂得和平的宝贵，伊拉克叙利亚为什么会被美国打？因为他们没能力报复美国本土，就像一个弱小的孩子被成年人欺负一样，他们没有付出代价，所以他们会一直欺负你，但是如果每次当他们欺负你的时候你把他们咬出了血，那么他们会认真考虑欺负你值不值得。.,1,0,902

If the DOJ with all it’s resources can’t consume enough evidence to indict anyone after two years,including Trump or Hillary Clinton (about those silly emails) the investigation needs to end. We use to call the claims by cowardly government officials that wouldn’t indict the powerful “paralysis by analysis”. I don’t know what is happening at the federal level, but Pomerantz who resigned from the Manhattan DA’s office claims the delays in indicting Trump were due to so much legal discussions that it paralyzed proceeding with a case. I suspect the same thing is happening with DOJ.","The power to pardon and to remove disabilities is vested in the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, although it may be prohibited from issuing a pardon or superseded by the legislature in cases involving recidivists and persons serving life sentences. Ga. Const. art. IV, § 2, para. II; see generally Ga. Peace Officer Standards & Training Council v. Mullis, supra. The governor is expressly precluded from exercising power over of granting of pardons or paroles. Ga. Code Ann. § 42-9-56.",1,0,721
10886,"It wasn't that the humans weren't telepathic, it's that they assumed the humans were a hive-species like them. Their worker drones weren't sentient, so they assumed the humans they were encountering weren't sentient either. They expected humanity to have it's hive-mind on Earth, like they had their hive-mind safely on their planet.",I’m not sure why Ukraine even wants to keep the separatist areas… the traitor population there has been fighting them since 2014… like actively killing Ukrainians in heavy military conflict; same with Crimea… that population mostly wants to be Russian (Crimea was always Russian until 1980s it was consolidated into Ukraine in the Soviet Union; but ya I can see letting your dire enemy keep a military base RIGHT next to your ports and kinda a unacceptable deal… but why keep a bunch of hostile separatists as well; Ukraine will need to Sherman’s march their asses at the very least; it could be acceptable to give them SOME territory or autonomy to the LPR/DPR (not Russia); maybe make that a DMZ buffer zone.,1,0,4126
2368,"The 2020 elections saw 77mil votes for democrats and 72mil votes for republicans. Gerrymandering affects election results, not votes cast. Half of the country is voting for this shit. You don’t have to believe it, the numbers don’t lie. The longer you take to accept that the longer it will take us to develop a plan that actually works. Without gerrymandering, yes dems would control the house. But I’m talking about the raw number of people voting for them. Why? Because these are the people ready to commit violence. Even so, these district maps are facts, we can’t change them. Saying “but only if there wasn’t gerrymandering” doesn’t do shit to stop the Republic from falling. So again, how was this past week a victory for democracy when it’s all but certain republicans will control congress for the next decade?","Can someone explain to me how winning by razor thin margins is a victory for democracy? Half of the country is voting for a party that not only wants to destroy liberal democracy, but they don’t even have plans to address kitchen table issues.",0,0,897
8222,"When Russia started it's war in Ukraine, many companies left to avoid bad press. It's difficult to create a media scenario which is so unpalatable to corporations, but public image is important to them, especially ageing legacy brands spending a lot of money to stay relevant.",Is it perfect? No. Every public event where he's on his own shows some of his failings. It's something the GOP will continually pounce on. I feel if a terrible gaffe happens in the next six months the Dems will look closer into a fresh face. Anytime after that it may be too late.,1,0,3139
7561,"They have a lot to lose by admitting culpability, and nothing really to gain, as the only people with any respect for truth or decency are firmly in Ukraine's corner over Russias blatant land grab. So it isn't too surprising tha they're just going to deny all knowledge until the dust settles and then probably make an admission of responsibility and apology a few years down the line when the consequences of doing so are less immediate.","Dude why. Why are you simping so hard for Russia? They are actively murdering innocent people who just want to live. I'll also point you to the fact there is NO way all of Russia's nuclear warheads are credibly ready to employ, nor are France's. But a few hundred? That's enough to wipe out a country. There is a reason they are considered a last resort weapon.",1,0,2883
4675,I seem to remember pictures of dead bodies just laying in the streets not that long ago. People here are it up. I’m not sure I trust these new videos.,"Having said all this, the vaccine situation among the elderly is extremely poor, and this sudden reopening has obviously been the opposite of how a reopening should be done. Most under-60s will be vaccinated but will most likely be more symptomatic than people elsewhere who had the modern vaccines.",1,0,1777
10086,"Perun did a great video analysis recently on 'vranyo', the culture of lying to save face and make yourself look better even when everyone knows it's a lie, and specifically how it has seriously damaged the Russian military's ability to operate effectively because every level of the operation is exaggerating their success and minimizing their failures.","I dunno man. I loved the games and was all excited to read the books but I got maybe halfway through the first one and just… stopped. I know it was originally in Russian and translated, but it feels like it’s written so strangely and is kind of hard to follow. Same with the Witcher novel, I stopped halfway through that one too. I wanted to like them both, but for some reason just had trouble with it.",1,0,3829
