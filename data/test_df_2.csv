Usually it's pointing to one off cases of dead people voting or people voting twice that are quickly proven false under scrutiny (i.e. two people happen to have the same name) and claiming that it represents a broader pattern. The main difference lately has been that instead of just claiming they were cheated, they try to do an insurrection and just install their guy.",1,2,34

Persians themselves are only 51% of the population and seeing as these figures are old and non-Persian regions have higher birthrates, its probably lower. The Kurds and Balochis both have active cross border insurgencies with the expressed goal of secession and the formation of a Kurdish and Balochi nation states. Iranian civilisation is old, the Iranian state through the various Iranian empires are old; and even Iranian nationalism is old(it even appeared in Sassanid propaganda). What is not old is the Iranian nation state itself. The matter of fact is Iranians haven’t experienced ethno-genesis in the same way say China has, banding together its various linguistic subgroups. The Iranian nation better resembles if anything the Russian Nation. The concept of Russia as a state was to be the nation state of the Russians, the East Slavic ethnic groups that inhabited the lands of the Kievan Rus. However, multiple subgroups, the Ukrainians especially held a strong attachment to their individual sub-identities, leading to the lack of ethno-genesis and the maintenance of multiple subnations(in this case its Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Rusyns) rather than one unified Nation. The Kurds and Persians may be Iranian, but they don’t necessarily care for the commonality between eachother.

47130,"C. It was the opposite of isolation, actually it was called appeasement for a reason! The allies basically allowed the Nazis to build an illegal army in complete violation of the treaty of Versailles and even didn't do anything when he invaded Czechoslovakia, only declaring war when Hitler invaded Poland.","A.

43626,I think there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic! The Republican Party his hardly unified anymore. MAGA/Q-Nuts are currently at war with “moderate” Republicans who want to put Trump & co. in their rear view mirror.

33302,Yep. Biden and Harris had a chance to take a step towards actual police reform and instead we got a watered down executive order and them wanting to reward law enforcement with even more funding while asking for no legitimate change in return.,Thoughts and prayers are nice.

The Russians are currently firing s300 rockets into apartment buildings….,0,2,2458
34766,The war we are seeing in Ukraine is between 2 relatively equal opponents. They’re relatively equal because neither side has definitive air superiority; if that wasn’t the case…this war would probably already be over (over with a lot of partisanship if Russia had won so not really a win).,"The military world Patton lived in was closer to world war 1 than it is to modern conflicts (both in terms of time, strategy, and the scale of forces at play in the war being fought) he cannot/should not be used as first reference point when deciding military strategy in modern conflicts.",0,2,396

Like the other commenter stated during the gulf war the MAK (led by Osama bin laden and later called Al Qaeda) was looking to expand his jihadist movement to other parts of the Arab world after winning the war against the soviets. Bin laden offered to aid Saudi Arabia with troops to protect against the Iraqi army. King Fahd rejected this offer and opted instead for US aid (which likely angered a lot of sympathizers of bin Laden's cause in Saudi Arabia, hence the large number of Saudi Arabian nationals involved in the attack). This animosity towards the US getting involved in the Arab world is the most likely cause for the attacks and Bin Laden wouldn't necessarily need funding from Saudi Arabia to pull it off since he had plenty of allies to his cause.",1,2,1041

According to the other, the majority of citizens do not support the war, but are afraid to answer honestly to pro-government sociologists. The truth is out there. Most likely, the share of support for the war is much lower than official sociological data - people are really afraid to speak honestly, there are criminal penalties for “discrediting the army” in Russia. According to the indirect results of independent researchers who do not ask directly, we can judge that support for the war specifically is not so high - people are tired of the news about the war, they would like peace negotiations (especially if Putin initiated them). Young Russians, as a rule, are against the war. There is an apathetic part of society, which continues to live as if nothing has happened - the war disturbs it. They don’t want to go to the front - according to polls, the level of anxiety in Russian society exceeds the level of calm. Moreover, anxiety arises at moments when new rumors of mobilization arise. Finally, there is indeed a large segment of society that supports the war: these are people who watch television and consider themselves supporters of the authorities. But again, in this group we can identify another subgroup - Russians who seriously think that this is a “special operation” and that the Russian army is fighting the Nazis. They are victims of propaganda. Thus, Russian society is very heterogeneous in its support for the war, although it should not be downplayed.","Amongst Russians who don’t support Putin and his invasion of Ukraine, what has been their view toward NATO prior to this decade?

This period of growth was ended by the little ice age and the second great bubonic plague. I’m not a climate denier or anything, I just think it’s important for people to understand that warmer doesn’t necessarily mean worse.

36639,"Personally, I feel this should be a prime example of why we should have representatives picked on a ratio basis of state votes as opposed to candidates running for individual districts, as most states have such lenient residency requirements for qualifying to run in a district as to make it laughable that a candidate needs to ""know"" their district. See Marjorie Taylor Greene or even Dr. Oz (yeah, I know, he didn't run in districted election, but he qualified to run without even actually having lived in the state for any appreciable amount of time, which was a factor in him losing) or any other carpetbagger that has won an election, quite honestly. Would I rather advocate for representatives to have at least a decent amount of experience within their own district? Absolutely. Am I being pragmatic about the way candidates move to qualify for a district they believe they can win as opposed to winning the district they're in and the way districts are redrawn every ten years, negating most or all of the ""hometown"" essence behind being a representative? I believe so. I used to live in a district that had a 200 by 20 mile with rural bubbles on the sides, splitting three heavily blue cities into multiple other districts that all went red because of how they were split up and countered by the rural vote. That's how you get cities that vote for blue presidents and blue senators and blue governors (and other blue statewide seats and mayor's/city leadership) but have solid red representatives in the US House and State legislatures. We had a cardboard cutout of our rep at town halls because he refused to show up to meet constituents unless it was a Republican donor event. There's a lot of that going on outside of major cities now, and even in some of the bigger cities. Just look at Nashville after this election. Gerrymandering split apart a very blue city with a large population to the point that there are no Democrats representing it, and only 1 Democrat was elected to the house from Tennessee, even though the numbers should have had 2 Democrats, at minimum. The Wisconsin elections are just as skewed, with districts radiating from Milwaukee and Madison in a way as to concentrate blue votes inside the cities and then negate them on the edges with sprawling districts that only make sense if you are admitting you can't win an election with maps that are remotely fair.","Or if you want direct comparisons, the 2016 presidential election is as far as you should have to look, as it is a two tiered election that ignores the popular vote in essence and rewards land and borders instead of the will of the electorate in general.",0,2,811

In either case, more housing will solve the problem.","There's not really a housing shortage. That's the wolf in sheep's clothing to keep everyone at bay. The real issue is that the way housing is currently set up is based on an era that has since come and gone. People are having way less children, people are commuting to work farther and farther, family sizes are much smaller and the whole dynamic has changed. We also have an aging demographic that are living in multiple homes that are way too big and priced out of the reach of a young family sometimes to the tune of 100 times the original price and not updated since the day it was purchased. Added to that is investment arm. Land values are rising, while the structures that are on them, not so much. However, this is housing and it is being torn down and rebuilt at the cost of gentrification and the added bonus of not actually adding any new housing stock and being substantially more expensive than whatever it replaced. Dense multifamily and commercial mixed zoning is great for the city tax coffers and the developer and the stock holders, but not so much for the people it intends to benefit.

It leads to asinine pieces of legislation like the Fixed Term Parliament Act which led to the Prime Minister of a minority government being deadlocked in parliament and yet unable to call an election despite opinion polls indicating if he did he would win a landslide majority in favour of what he wanted to do, simply because he was unable to ask the monarch to exercise the prerogative right to call elections and the opposition knew elections would see them decimated and so repeatedly blocked them in the house. In the end, he was forced to wait until a scheduled recess and use the still extant prerogative of prorogation (arguably far less democratic, ironically) to force through his program by default.

Numerous countries whom the Russians sold their weapons of war in exchange for a strange and shaky allegiance are now sending those weapons to the Ukraine with a ""Return to Sender"" notice for which the very weapons the Russians used to destabilize the world with global arms races are now being used against them.","Obviously a lot of these weapons, vehicles and defense systems won’t outlive the war, but are there agreements between these countries and Ukraine on what happens to this equipment after the war?",1,2,1977

Jesus told me abortions are just fine, that you're an idiot and that no one should listen to you."" Anything they try to claim is ""God's will"", just immediately dispute while claiming you spoke directly to God and that he agrees with you.","If the ""Christian"" tries to claim authority based on the Bible, just tell them they're reading the wrong Bible. Tell them that Jesus gave you a copy of the ""true bible"" and told you not to show it to assholes because they like to misinterpret things to their own benefit. Any passage they try to read from their own Bible, simply comment that Jesus told you he redacted that section. ""Jesus told me that they stopped doing this shit in the middle ages, and in the 2023 version, that section is removed."".",0,2,2865

43390,"While the Republicans are undoubtedly more corrupt, can we really believe that Democrats who accept generous donations from corporate lobbyists are not influenced by them?","An yes Republicans are far more corrupt then Democrats but you still have to ask Why is it that when it comes to supporting the rich and powerful, both corporate Democrats and Republicans can find common ground and pass bills easily?

This is part of why Poland is modernizing, they’re going to send their old Soviet tanks to Ukraine.","I would assume right now the plan is send them the couple hundred Soviet tanks (and polish upgrade models of said tanks) to Ukraine and when it’s all over start modernizing them. You have to remember Ukraine has captured more Russian tanks than what they’ve lost (lost:430, captured: 530), some of which are modern T-90 varients.",0,2,2585

They did after 9/11 and that was in fucking Afghanistan. It‘s not far fetched to believe that Germany would support a neighboring country when under the threat of invasion. Stop being a spiteful Germany hating German and check some facts.","So where is your evidence for Germany not being an unreliable ally? Right you don’t, you are just talking crap. Germany has shown now multiple times it values Gasprom over their partners.",1,2,1771

It's clear India has massive projects in Iran which was literally started years before. Also, India condemns the actions of Iran (and Russia for that fact), however, they can't choose an extremely aggressive stance like the US without the risk of losing a fuckton of money, resources, and time invested in the Chabahar Port project.",1,2,1880
