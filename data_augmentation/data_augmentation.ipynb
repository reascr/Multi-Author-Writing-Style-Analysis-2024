    "### Data Augmentation and Oversampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to leverage the metadata and following the alogrithm proposed by Hashemi et al. (2023) to get pairs of non-consecutive paragraphs (with and\n",
    "without style changes). Then, classes will be oversampled to obtain a balanced data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of algorithm: \" incorporate additional non-consecutive pairs of paragraphs\n",
    "into our sample set and assign them labels based on the inferred relationships. For example, if\n",
    "there are three consecutive paragraphs without a style change, we can infer that the first and\n",
    "third paragraphs are written by the same author. Similarly, if there are style changes between\n",
    "the first and second paragraphs and between the second and third paragraphs, we can deduce\n",
    "that the authors of the first and third paragraphs are different, given that the number of authors\n",
    "in the document exceeds the number of style changes by one.\" (Hashemi et al. 2023: 4)."
